0,"Tb to September when my hair was PINK! 😍 That was all I was going to say for this caption but then I started thinking... While I don’t believe in gender stereotypes in the slightest I love exploring and playing around with them. It actually took me a long time to be comfortable with loving the colour pink if you can believe it! I would question if I was only drawn to it because of deeply rooted stereotypes. Honestly, perhaps that IS the reason. I haven’t figured it out and I’m still unpacking a lot to do with expectations that are placed onto both genders.

However, I’ve realised I need to be kinder to myself and not push myself to rebel against everything. I’ve accepted that pink makes me happy so umm, expect to see more pink hair in the future! :) 💘💘💘 Have you ever thought about reasons you might be drawn more to traditionally feminine/masculine things?",genderstereotype,"|#pinkhair #pinkaesthetic #hair #pink #selfie #love #alternativegirl #pinkhairdontcare #fashion #beauty #instagirl #girlselfie #genderstereotype #feminist #feminism #empowerment #feminists #equality #girlpower #womensrights #genderequality #selflove #selfcare #loveyourself #positivevibes #happy #selfworth #instagood #confidence #bodypositive|❤️|My dad basically raised me until I was 5 because my mum worked so much. I think I grew up wanting to be a boy because he wanted a son. I’ve always been drawn to more “masculine” things, despite looking and presenting very feminine. My partner is way more feminine than masculine and points out that I embody ‘toxic masculinity’ more than he does— which isn’t wrong! This is something I’ve been thinking of for quite a while now!|Figuring out what's intrinsic and not is so difficult! It's an interesting journey though.|Wow💖💖💖",72
1,"Plan International Deutschland e.V. hat die 56 umsatzstärksten Filme aus dem Jahr 2018 in 20 Ländern auf Genderstereotype untersucht. Nur in einem Punkt haben die Frauen die Männer übertrumpft: In Nackt-Szenen.
#1LIVE #Kino #Genderstereotype",genderstereotype,"|Männer bleiben eben Männer und Frauen eben Frauen was anderes ist schlicht und einfach wider natürlich|👎🏻|Unwas ??? 😉|Warum sind wohl Filme mit starken mannlichen Rollen und nackter Haut beliebt. Männer stehen auf Action Filme und Frauen auf schnulzen mit liebes szenen. Rein Stereotyp betrachtet. Männer und Frauen beeinflussen das folglich beide in diese Richtung. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Man kann halt auch aus allem ne gender Geschichte machen. Kein Wunder dass keiner mehr Bock auf das Thema hat wenn es so zerkaut wird|Wayne juckts?|Schöner Schreibfehler... übertrumpt! 😂|Und was soll das jetzt genau Aussagen?|Dafür sterben in den Filmen auch mehr Männer...|@sveggi_ @barbie_dur @xtina_gerbr8|Ehm cool. Denk ich. Oder? Warte was jetzt damit?|Und am meisten enttäuscht mich dabei, dass wir viel zu wenig nackte Männer sehen😂|Meeeeine Güte, dafür holen Frauen das im Alltag nach...|@jojo_joram|In den 56 umsatzstärksten Filmen.... warum liegt hier Stroh?? 😂|Und jetzt?!|Ganz einfach wir Frauen brauchen eben nur 33 % um alles wichtige in diesen Filmen zu sagen😎 der Rest ist dann wohl relativ unwichtig😋|Reicht es nicht, dass Frauen im echten Leben mehr Quatschen? Wenigstens im Film kommen die Kerle mal zu Wort.|👌🤣zu recht|Finde ich als Frau (fast) gar nicht so schlimm, weibliche Rollen sind in meinen Augen oft nervig und übertrieben, da verzichte ich lieber|Total unrealistisch. Frauen reden 200% im echten Leben. Filme sind daher ne gelungen Abwechslung 🤷‍♂️|Frauen sind nackt einfach schöner als Männer 🤷|Ist über-trump-t ne Freud‘sche Fehlleistung? 🤪😂|Na und? Ist doch egal welches Geschlecht, letztendlich kommt es doch auf die Schauspielkünste drauf an|Schade, das ausgerechnet immer die Frauen mit der „sex sells „ Methode vor die Klitsche gebracht werden. Und dann soll man Frauen ernst nehmen, wenn man nur sowas sieht ? Kaum sieht man Männer die sich nackt präsentieren. Genauso wenn eine Frau komplett Pudel Nudel gezeigt wird in einem Film, warum ist dann nie der Long dong von einem Mann zu sehen ? Bsp. Got, Frauen ohne Ende von oben bis unten nackt. Aber wenig  Nudeln. Fairness im Film ? Gibt es nicht. Genauso wie Werbungen. Wie ätzend immer eine nackte Frau zu sehen die am Ende Parfum , Burger oder Autos vorstellt .. aber naja,|@la.lalaura und @svenjas.lens ... inhaltliches, für den nächsten Workshop 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩|Und 99% fällt's doch gar nicht auf, also wayne interessiert's. Geschaut haben wir die Filme trotzdem und fanden sie vermutlich auch gut 🙄|Ja und bezahlt werden sie doch alle gleich ? Und wollt ihr lieber mehr nackte Männer sehen ?|Ist mir scheißegal. Wirklich. Wenn diesen Stereotypen in den umsatzstärksten Filmen entsprochen wird, heißt das doch, dass es einen Markt dafür gibt. Dass Menschen genau das sehen wollen. Und dass noch mehr meiner Meinung sind: Ist mir scheißegal. Wenn der Plot das hergibt, dann ist die Frau eben tough. Oder clever. Oder reif. Oder nackt. Und wenn mir der Plot nicht gefällt, schau ich mir diese Scheiße nicht an. Und ihr verschwendet nicht wichtige Zeit und Ressourcen, euch mit so einem Schwachsinn zu beschäftigen. Warum kann das Leben nicht immer so einfach sein? Es würde mir zu denken geben, wenn Filme beliebt sind, in denen Frauen nicht viel reden. Ich meine, mal ernsthaft: Was erwartet ihr denn? Was erwartet man jetzt, nachdem diese Zahlen erhoben und veröffentlicht sind, von mir? Dass ich auf die Straße gehe, damit Michelle Rodriguez im nächsten ""Fast and the Furious"" 'ne Archäologieprofessorin spielt?|Was ist das für ein Verein? Besteht deren Gemeinnützigkeit daraus Probleme zu machen, die keine Relevanz haben mittels Antworten auf ungestellte Fragen? 🤔|Wenn hier eine Frau kommentiert das dass ihr egal ist kommt direkt als Antwort das dass traurig und sie keine Ahnung hat hahah 😂Meinungsfreiheit und so|Ihr habt Probleme... Kümmert euch um wichtige Dinge. Wir haben andere Probleme in diesem Land|Tja 1live...ihr steht wohl ziemlich alleine da mit eurer Meinung!?|#fakenews, zeig mir nur eine Frau die jemals, egal wo oder wann, nur einen 33% tigen Redeanteil hatte ;-D|Gott sei Dank gibt es heutzutage keine anderen Probleme 🤦🏽‍♂️|😲😞|@drehaaa|I don't see the point... Ich meine die Aussage, dass es die umsatzstärksten Filme sind, sagt ja schon, dass die Leute die Filme trotz all der Widrigkeiten gesehen haben und das gerne.|33% Redeanteil gibts für Frauen auch echt nur im Film... 😂|Und im WDR gibt es nun auch „Mann TV“? 🧐😂 Alles gut! Die richtige Mischung macht’s.|1/3 Redeanteil bei 1/3 der Rollen ist ziemlich positiv zu bewerten oder irre ich?
Nackte Männer sind tatsächlich seltener, habe ich zugegeben aber nie vermisst 😅|Wenn sie die umsatzstärksten Filme 2018 waren, kann das nicht nur an männlichen Kinogängern liegen. Ich denke, dass auch viele Frauen da rein gegangen sind und von diese auch gezielt ausgesucht haben. Sci-Fi, Robots, Politisches etc. finden Frauen auch gut. Während Männer deutlich seltener zum Liebes- oder Esoterikgenre greifen. Man sollte sich den Prozentteil der dort vertretenen Frauen in Drehbuch und Darstellern mal anschauen. Das würde mich auch selbst mal interessieren. Ich finde man sollte jedem die gleichen Chancen geben. Aber bitte nicht versuchen Menschen ein Bewusstsein auch für ihre Zerstreuung einzutrichtern. Ich möchte gerne in die Filme gehen, die ich mag, die gut sind und nicht durch political correctness ihre Kreativität verlieren. Dann sehen sie nämlich irgendwann alle gleich aus.|ALS. NICHT WIE. 🙄|Ich wüsste keinen Film 2018 mit nacktszenen|@maik_checkonetwo|Aha.|33% Redeanteil... Deshalb kommen mir die Filme alle so unrealistisch vor.|🤷‍♀️|🤦‍♂️",2520

6,"Heute morgen habe ich den Gastbeitrag ""Warum ich als Dax-CEO auf Instagram bin"" von @oliver_baete - Vorstandsvorsitzender der Allianz SE - in der Ausgabe 2 der Zeitschrift @join_ada gelesen. Herr Bäte stellt u.a. heraus, dass er auf Instagram ""Frauen"" erreichen will und auf seinem Kanal auch ""tüchtige und erfolgreiche #Frauen"" vorstellt. Allerdings berücksichtigt er Frauen* sprachlich nur 1x in seinem Artikel - ""Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter"". ""Unternehmenslenker"" können anscheinend nur #Männer sein, ""das jugendliche Engagement der Teilnehmer"", ""[e]in tolles Medium, um mit jungen Kunden und Mitarbeitern weltweit Kontakt zu halten""... hier werden Frauen* sprachlich nicht sichtbar gemacht. Mir reicht es nicht mehr, sprachlich nur mitgemeint zu sein, vor allem, wenn ich eindeutig als Zielgruppe definiert werde. Frauen* und ebenso nicht-binäre Personen müssen auch sprachlich sichtbar gemacht werden, denn #Sprache beeinflusst unser #Denken! Eine gendergerechte Sprache kann dabei helfen, #Genderstereotype abzubauen.

Deshalb habe ich Herrn Bäte hier über #Instagram kontaktiert - ich finde es übrigens wirklich positiv, dass er Instagram nutzt. Ich habe ihm folgendes geschrieben:⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ""Hallo Herr Bäte,
ich habe heute Ihren Artikel ""Warum ich als Dax-CEO auf Instagram bin"" in der Ausgabe 2 der Zeitschrift ada gelesen. Sie sagen, dass Instagram Ihren Wunsch erfüllt hat, ""[k]ommunikativ präsent [zu] sein in der Altersgruppe 25 bis 34 Jahren und bei Frauen. Also dort, wo meine jungen Mitarbeiter und meine morgigen Kunden sind."" Sie sagen, sie stellen auf ihrem Kanal ""Mitarbeiter vor, insbesondere tüchtige und erfolgreiche Frauen.""⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Frauen* scheinen Ihnen wichtig zu sein. Warum sprechen Sie sie dann nicht auch ""sprachlich"" an? Ich bin kein Mitarbeiter, ich bin eine Mitarbeiterin. Und ich bin auch kein Kunde, ich bin eine Kundin. Sie sagen, sie möchten ""als Mensch mit einer Aufgabe und einer Persönlichkeit wahrgenommen werden"", das würde ich auch wollen, noch dazu würde ich gerne auch wirklich angesprochen werden und nicht nur im generischen Maskulinum (Mitarbeiter, Kunden) mitgemeint sein. *** weiter in den Kommentaren ***",genderstereotype,"|Wenn es Ihnen also wirklich so sehr um Frauen* geht, sprechen Sie uns doch bitte auch an, anstatt uns nur mitzumeinen. 
Um außerdem auch Personen einzubeziehen, die sich als nicht-binär identifizieren, könnten Sie bspw. auf das Gendersternchen zurückgreifen. 
Mit freundlichen Grüßen""  Den Artikel mit Herrn Bäte findet man übrigens auch online beim Handelsblatt. Ich habe einen Auszug mal in meine Story gepostet.|#paris #gender #stereotypes #bookstore #bookworm|Love it! ❤️",17

The associated connotations of masculinity and femininity place people into boxes, leaving little scope for manoeuvre.

We are called selfish for wanting a career over marriage, yet called useless when we choose to be homemakers...
We are either trying too hard to look good and attract men, or we are not worthy enough for men when we choose self love and body positivity...
We are tagged wannabes if we archive our own glory, while those who want a man to make their dream come true are tagged gold diggers...

18,"Yesterday we took a trip to Asda living.  When there,as with any place that has a baby section, I had a browse and AJ said we can get one thing (he knows I'd go a bit mad otherwise ha, and we are mainly holding out until after our reveal) I saw this 3 pack and instantly found it adorable and it made me giggle. I bought it, somewhat on impulse, and that was that
.
When I got into the car and showed AJ, he read it and went ""well, I don't need a baby grow to tell me I've got this"" and all of a sudden, I realised what I'd bought in my moment of impulse
.
Me, mummy, gets cuddles and kisses. AJ, daddy, gets reassurance of ""Don't worry Daddy, you've totally got this (Mummy said so)"" and I instantly felt uncomfortable
. 
Why wouldn't he have ""got"" this? He hasn't got it any less than I have. So why do I get cute things, and he gets a babygrow that already puts down and questions his capabilities before baby is even here; Why?! Because he's Dad? Because he's a man? .
.
I am one who is so, so for equality in all aspects and it's something I plan to instill in our little one as they grow, but by putting them in this baby grow, I feel like I'll be doing the opposite from the very day they get here
.
Yes, these onesies are very bloody cute, but what it implies is so much more than that. I'm shocked I got swept away in the cuteness of it; I know there's many who may not agree and I'm more than open to different ideas and a discussion about it 💕 We all have different views and every one is valid, which I love and is what it's all about.
.
AJ, and any Daddy out there, you've got this. Not because Mummy said so, but because you are Daddy, and that alone means you will rock it 💪🏻

I think a lot of men doubt themselves/worry, as we mums do, but probably more so because we are pregnant and are prepared gradually if that makes sense. We’re a mum from that positive test, men have a bit longer as their lives don’t “really change” until the baby is here. I’ve read it as a positive, you’ve got this “mummy said so”. It tells me you’re a team and your wife/partner backs you. (I’ve probably explained this naff, but hopefully you will see the angle I’m coming from) xx|I find this a lot with children’s clothing! I also hate the clothing that insists boys are ‘trouble’ and girls are princesses! 🤦🏼‍♀️ xxx|I have also bought this set from Asda. And as much as I agree with everything you have said above, and I think it's fantastic that AJ is confident and ready to take on your growing bundle of joy. For me I bought it for a different reason. My OH struggled incredibly with confidence when our son was born 2 years ago, he felt that he was too rough with handling, or wasn't sure what was the correct way to bathe our son, was he changing his nappy correctly etc etc. So for us this little body suit is a reminder that no matter what he CAN and IS the best dad to our children. And that little bit of morale support is just what he needs to boost himself.|It also doesn’t say “because”, I think it’s just positive reinforcement x|I hate the way men are made to feel like this.

My husband is virtually ignored in all the pregnancy appointments etc. When we were at the park the other day he pointed out a dad playing with his baby and the women being gushy about it - you don’t get that with a mum playing with her baby. But baby clothes are already so gendered that it’s not a surprise that the messages go along with that too. I’m sure you’re both going to ace it xx|Been shopping at asda for years and this is the first time seeing it, I have boys and loads of there tops say about daddy being awesome and being there hero, this isnt a normal, also most first time dad's are shit scared not even kidding but husband became someone I didn't recognise, he was so excited but so worried he wouldn't be good enough, wouldn't have that bond, you two have had to try even harder for a family so you both appreciate everything so much more, this top would have be great for my husband, he needing reminding that he will be great and two down still needs to hear his a good dad|I was going to get this. Purely because my husband has said he wouldn't know how to hold a baby. Whereas I would, as I work in a day nursery. However, my concern would be a new mom or dad who are struggling but not confident to speak out, especially because as women we are suppose to have the maternal sense - which is not always reality.|How true! 🤯 I actually never thought about this until your post just now. Thank goodness I haven’t bought anything along these lines for baby. I hope not anyway! X|I totally agree! My Husband was a pro already before our first arrived because all his siblings were 9 years, 13 years & 17 years younger than him plus all of his cousins had started having their kids so he had been changing nappies & babysitting long before me, because all but 1 of my siblings are close in age to me so I wasn't around babies much. And to be fair the one time I changed my baby sisters nappy I put it on backwards 😂 When our firstborn arrived my Husband was my rock because he just knew what to do, so I followed his lead ❤️|Totally with you on this, we hate these too|I am 100% in agreement with you on this! Why do these messages have to put dads down and presume mums are awesome from the start? Honestly I’m currently sat here at 41 weeks + 2 days going to be induced Thursday if the baby doesn’t show up on it’s own by then and I’m a mess! My husband literally has this, he’s calm he’s confident he’s excited and I’m terrified. Not even about the labour about how I’m going to look after this baby once it’s here. I specifically haven’t found out what gender my child is to avoid people gender stereotyping before it is even born.|do you know sex yet ? x|Oh my I love this post! We are so deeply ingrained with the stereotype that women are deeply maternal, instinctive creatures and men are bumbling fools. we don’t always see pieces like this for what they are- a reinforcement of that stereotype. These vests don’t specifically cause harm but that stereotype DOES. It puts down men’s very real capabilities, with the potential to cause a self fulfilling prophecy so to speak. And what of the mum who isn’t naturally maternal? That’s okay too. She’s no less a mother. The inequality is sadly still very real. My husband takes the kids shopping he’s branded a brave hero whereas just yesterday I was asked if I was in my right mind to do the same. These attitudes aren’t harmless.  Mums aren’t instantly given a handbook and know what to do and dads don’t automatically find child care a challenge. Definately about time we challenged these attitudes!",193
19,"""Kiss your friends' faces more. Destroy the belief that intimacy must be reserved for monogamous relationships"" 👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨 (@lora__mathis mathis) 💋Nikki here! ⁠Male friendships are often portrayed in stereotypical and intolerant ways. ""Lad culture"" and ""bromance"" both undermine and minimise the ways that men interact with other men. Lad culture rewards toxic masculinity and discourages men from talking about their feelings. Close male friendships are often labelled as bromances, with the assumption that hugging or being intimate with a man is ""gay"". Gender stereotypes hurt everyone. Male friendship should be celebrated! Space needs to be created for men to express their closeness, trust and intimacy with each other, however feels comfortable.👬 We all deserve friendship and we all deserve to express our gender identity freely!⁠

22,"Playing with dolls or stuffed animals does not make them a Girl!
.
My son loves to play with dolls and stuffed toys as much as he loves to play with cars and blocks. He is as fond of talking about fairies and magic as creating his own imaginary stories around spaceships, aliens and super heros.. and there is so much more!
.
When children play with dolls, they learn to care for others and display emotions through pretend play! If you look closely, there is a lot a child is learning through all kinds of play!
.
So, let us stop stereotyping what a boy can do or not do and just let them be!

27,"Meat is masculine. How food advertising perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.

Caption of photo: 'It's always a bloke seen attacking a huge burger in the adverts, isn't it? 📷 Odua Images via Shutterstock
.
.
.
In this brilliantly written and well researched article by Kate Stewart and Matthew Cole (link in comments) they share how the recent ban in the UK on advertisments featuring negative gender stereotypes is a great first step however does not take into account stereotypes in animal product advertising and the link between gender and animal products.
.
.
.
The article references subtle messages as to how ads show that 'girls aspire to prepare and serve cooked animals (a roast in this case) and sons aspire to share the adult male pleasure of consuming those animals (a ""juicy steak"").
.
.
I have seen this concept repeated in children's clothing designs. As a general rule, boy's shirts feature 'manly' images of burgers, fries, pizza and hot dogs. I would be surprised to ever find a girl's shirt featuring a big juicy burger and fries or a meaty pizza! The implication being that it is 'manly' to chow down into a big piece of steak or burger. .
.

.
I recently talked about mine a bit on twitter: one thing I find irritating is how pink is for girls and blue is for boys. Until the early 20th Century, I believe, pink was for boys and blue was for girls! Let’s stop designating colours for genders! It doesn’t really matter if a baby girl wears blue (as one genius in my extended family said about our baby photos: ‘how is that your sister if she is wearing blue?’ - or something along the lines of that!). .

Girl and boy toys annoy me, I say let kids play freely it’s how they express their individuality. X|Not necessarily a a stereotype but I hate when anyone says what “a real woman is.” Was recently at a concert where an artist made a statement that “real women” weren’t size 2 or size 4... and that those sizes weren’t natural. As a petite woman, I am in fact one of those sizes so it’s shameful that some people have to stoop to bringing down others to lift themselves up!|I hate that if a woman is big busted and not wearing turtlenecks, people tend to assume she is ""easy"".

Okay let’s do this:
First, with you on the colour and gender issue. But I think you knew that. 
Second, autistics are for some reason ALWAYS compared to Rainman and Hoffmans character (great movie though). Some tend to think that unless you are similar to Rainman, you can’t be autistic.
Third, I’m really not a satanist because I listen to metal music (true story question🙈)
Fourth, unemployed or long term sick leave does not equal laziness.
And five ( I COULD go on as I am allergic to stereotypes and stereotypical opinions, but I don’t want to clog up your lovely feed😘): bloggers and Instagrammers are not all mindless people with nothing better to do.

Meishi, 2019. 50 fictive visit cards. ""Meishi"" is the name given to business cards in Japan. They are a summary of what you are, and they must be sober and neutral: any flourish would only discredit you. In the West, the business card also says a lot about who presents it. Can you be an important businessman and see your name written in pink? As inclusive writing becomes more popular and generalized, I began thinking about the form of writing. ""Meishi"" offers fifty fictitious business cards, which use and abuse pink, quirky and feminine typography, kitsch and futile images. By making mockery of real figures of dictators, politicians, or personalities who have made sexist remarks, the work shows how, in the graphic arts too, gender and class stereotypes abound. ◽

Even they have a lot on their plate plus the gender stereotypes make it worse at times coz they take more time to open up, share or cry.⁣
⁣
Just piling up the issues going inside one's head and layering it up with drinks, night outs, hangouts or overeating doesn't really help!⁣

So don't think of it as a very BIG THING it is mostly like a sneeze and you will get over it, but first give it a try :)⁣

45,"Today was a tough day. I was really pleased to work with BBC Wales on a feature for Wales Live on challenging gender stereotypes. We filmed in Newport, and it was the first time I'd been back since writing about being homeless there, over 2 decades ago. It was really hard being back in the same place that holds so many difficult memories...with so many prominent triggers. I was so anxious I hardly slept last night. But I did it anyway - and once I did, it didn't seem so scary any more. I've said before that being brave doesnt mean you're not afraid of something, it means doing something despite being afraid.

Although just as I thought the lump on my throat going to turn into a boulder...I cracked up realising that the graffiti wall in the background was covered in...erm...pictures inappropriate for the Beeb 🤣

By far the highlight of the day was meeting Gabriella, Poppy and Sian at Llanwern High. These three amazing girls filled me with inspiration, they were so full of sass and their enthusiasm for the future was infectious.

Why, when searching for the girl there is mostly in the western vision „pretty girls” and almost no children? And why when searching for boys there is a lot of blue and multiply sport related images?

But what is even more noticeable is the absence of POC children and teenagers.

53,"I was around 16/17 when I first started coming in contact with queer theory and the idea of gender performance. I had always been uncomfortable with exuberant femininity, and suddenly I was able to experiment with my identity outside the confines of it. Playing around with gender stereotypes and androgyny helped me understand so much about my sexuality, my personality, and it gave me the confidence that I have today to perform in any way I want because I know that doesn't confine or entrap me anymore. It gave me control of when, where, how and with whom I choose to enact my ""womanhood"". I think this is why these ideas cause so much backlash; gender norms are a trap, designed to take away our agency over our own roles in society and make us slaves to gender stereotypes.",genderstereotype,|#sexpositivity #queer #queerness #lingerieaddict #garterbelt #portraitphotography #bourlesque #bourlesquephotography #cabaret #cabaretbizarre #berlinvibes #girlsinmoustaches #moustache #girlymoustache #mulherdebigode #minadebigode #genderstereotype #gendernroms #genderperformance #androgyny,48

60,"Let’s talk ➡️➡️➡️ Yesterday was Day 2 testing out the new Motion Fitness here in Saskatoon and I took a second to check out the “Empower” AKA Women’s only area and I was a little bit surprised, possibly disappointed? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
...
I’ve only ever had positive experiences at Motion Fitness and the staff there is incredible to me, the new space is gorgeous, so it’s no attack on them, but I thought this would be a good opportunity for some healthy discussion regarding gender stereotypes. 🚺🚹
...
I was surprised at how gender stereotyped the space felt, from the flowers and empower title on the outside to the pastel Easter egg colours on the inside that don’t align with the theme and colouring of the rest of the gym, I just felt like they kind of missed the mark here🤔
...
I’m always torn on what I think of the women’s only area as it is. I’m grateful for it because I know how many women and how many of my clients feel more comfortable there, but I also know there are some men who aren’t necessarily comfortable on the main floor and don’t have any options. It also leads to an internal debate for me when it comes to gender equality, but that’s a different conversation for a different time. 😬 #letsnotstart 🥰
...
Let’s focus on the seemingly very gender stereotyped women’s only area. I want to know, what do you think? Am I being sensitive? 😅😅
...
Does calling the area “Empower” make you feel more empowered? Do pastel colours make you feel more empowered? Would you possibly know it was a women’s only area if there weren’t pastels inside? 😉
...
I feel like in order to truly make women feel empowered and comfortable in the gym it would better serve them to have a more similar vibe in the women’s only area, that calling the area “empower” somehow reflects that the women using the space aren’t already empowered, and that we are delicate flowers, but we don’t need our designated space to be highlighted with flowers and we can handle the same color tones as the rest of the gym 🙌
...
But that’s just me, swipe for some poor quality post workout pictures and let me know what you think! 🤗⬇️

#womensonlyarea #yxe #saskatoon #genderequality #genderstereotype",genderstereotype,"|How is the equipment and space size? The one on Nelson is quite small and it’s all resistance machines, no squat rack etc. I’d love it to be an area that feels and looks like the rest of the gym while being secluded. That was my hope when I signed up, anyways. I’ve yet to notice the colour of a gym though. I look forward to going to see it. Thanks for the updates!|Ah that is disappointing. I wonder how many women were involved in the designing of the area.  Were there at least squat racks and barbells there?|@_mackkenzie|YAAAAS!!!!!! I complained to the staff member who gave me a tour. I even asked where the “Empower” room was for the males? 
Why can’t it be just neutral and empowerment be the theme throughout the whole facility!?! So happy someone else thought this too! You’re such a boss @kalliyoungstrom 💪🏻❤️☺️|This makes me disappointed too. Haven’t checked it out yet but I hate the gender stereotyping. The women’s only at Nelson infuriates me as the machines don’t even have ‘weights’ they have levels. It is so degrading|Not a fan! I always felt like I was hiding in those rooms like I wasn't good enough to be in the main gym. Empowerment doesn't belong in a hidden room!|Oh gosh those flowers are cringey 🙄😩|i hate the flowers and the colours. when i go to the gym i want to feel like a badass-not a disney princess? the decor makes me feel like they’re being patronizing (likely that wasn’t the point but that’s the impression)|Those colours make me want to go to sleep 😴|To be honest I didn't even notice the different coloring the part that frustrated me in the other motion women's only areas is the machines you can use do not have a weight on the amount you can lift. I also have maxed out two of them and don't feel really challenged by them because of that. I did enjoy this new one very much because it had more equipment and some machines that all the other don't at all.|I found the one in Lloyd seemed fairly ill equipped, small and stuffy. I think I’d like to see a beginners section regardless of gender and then it’s fine to have more basic equipment if that’s all there is money/room for. Gives people a safe space to start and once they outgrow that equipment hopefully they feel more comfortable in the main gym.|Does it at least have decent equipment? That’s always been my beef with women’s only spaces in gyms. It’s nice to feel safe in these spaces, but they usually have like... no equipment. A couple set of dumbbells and maybe some cardio equipment.|Seems like they definitely missed the mark. Pastel colours, flowers, and an empower title.  Gimme a break but I am probably a bad person to ask because I already take issue with women's only areas.  I know @carschneid7 mentioned a beginner's area where people can become accustomed to exercise and the equipment as opposed to women's only area.  That is something I could get behind...with a normal colour scheme of course.|I was so distracted at the fact that I had so much more equipment in the ladies Area compared to Anytime. I didn't take note of anything else. But would probably notice it later. Great space and equipment. But I would feel more empowered working out in the main gym floor than just a ladies area. That's just me though. ✌️|Your arms!!! 😍😍😍you’re looking SO good!!!!|Okay, not to be mean but I think we are all too sensitive in general. I don’t even like the idea of a separate area for women: look 👀 around, no one cares about you they are busy doing their own workout.,,...|I feel like it’s more a beginners area than a women’s area....like if you are ready for a squat rack you are ready to be in the main part of the gym ....|I typically workout in the main area of the gym but... if I were to workout in the woman’s only space I would want it to seem just like the rest of the gym. Nothing special or different besides the fact that it’s women’s only. It drives me nuts when there’s women only areas but all they have is a circuit and cardio machines like maybe women don’t like free weights? I don’t think you’re being sensitive but maybe I’m a bit sensitive lol 😅|I don't think you missed the mark at all! Flowers are beautiful but they're not ""empowering"" same with pastel colors. They don't scream powerful to me.|missed the mark here completely. looks like a daycare|I could talk for hours on this topic. I was raised in an extremely conservative religious culture and we women bore the lion's share of the responsibility of potraying to ""the world"" that we were a ""seperate people"". The men could wear whatever they wanted but the women had a dress code. We had to wear homemade dresses with high necklines, sleeves and no shorter than just below the knee. And that was just the beginning of the female suppression. We were not allowed to lead the singing or speak in church to name a few. When I turned 40 I saw a picture of Nicole Wilkins on Facebook and an ember inside of me burst into flame. I told Lorne, ""I am going to look like that some day."" And I got into bodybuilding. I will leave to your imagination how intimidating it was for me to go from how I was raised to throwing on a pair of leggings & a tank top and walking into a gym full of jacked dudes and doing a workout. But, you know what? That was the most empowering thing I have ever done for myself. Many of those dudes who terrified me at first are now my good friends. Take it from me, women don't need their own room with Easter egg color themes. We are too much for a space like that. It can't hold us in... (Just my thoughts)|Yikes, those flowers? Are you sure you weren’t in the daycare area? 🤢|I 10000% agree. I actually felt a little offended? Not to mention you have to walk all the way to the back, through the entire gym/main floor area...which I didn’t appreciate either. And I tried to work out in there and felt blah because nothing in it made me feel “empowered” to move 🤷🏼‍♀️ maybe I’m salty because I was so excited for it to open and it took a couple extra months lol. I’m actually kind of meh on the whole gym in general (giving it the benefit of the doubt for now since it’s actually not finished). But that’s just my opinion!!|Personally, as a larger, insecure and in not the best shape woman- I would be FAR from caring about the decor and how it made me feel about feminism & would just be happy that I’d feel a BIT less pressure and more in my own comfort zone in this particular room....... I think everyone commenting is probably someone that is confident in their fitness levels and comfortable in the “main space”|Looked like a kid’s play area for a sec if it wasn’t for the weights and equipment|I've never been to a gym with a women's only area but I probably wouldn't use it. I'm fortunate to not have any issues working out with the men. The flowers reminded me of the children's play area in most of the gyms I've been to. Don't care for the color and I'd actually prefer bolder colors that convey empowerment vs light, delicate colors such as these.|I love ""women's only"" sections at gyms in theory but they are often so poorly executed that I never use them. They usually just have machines and lightweight dumbbells. There is nothing wrong with using these but it just isn't very inclusive to women that prefer heavier equipment. The point (to me) is to have a safe place to workout, free from leering or condescending men so it would be nice if they had ""manly"" (🙄) equipment in there as well. (Ps, I don't think all men go to the gym to leer or talk down to women but it's nice to have an escape from those that do, especially when doing hip thrusts or straight legged deadlifts)|Can’t wait to check it out tm. @kalliyoungstrom|Cringe 😬 to me that seems like more of a kids only area!
Yes I think it’s ok to have a women’s only area for those who do not feel comfortable in the large area with everyone but don’t make it any different! They don’t need to make you feel like a child going Into a happy coloured floral room with that saying. I dunno I don’t go to gyms but reading that and looking at the pics I literally made this face 😬lol|I was put off by the little flowers too...it looks kind of childish. 🤔 I also don’t understand this kind of gender stereotyping, but I guess I can appreciate that they were trying to appeal to women and make them feel comfortable...?? Ladies areas are always interesting...I hardly ever use them, because the machines don’t even have weights listed (just levels?? 🤦🏼‍♀️), and usually only up to 20lb dumbbells (although I didn’t look that closely in the new one). I would rather it just be labelled a women’s area, and match the rest of the place. Labelling it the “Empower” room feels...a bit patronizing. 😶 But overall, it is a beautiful space! Gotta get rid of the hippy daisies on the wall though. 😅|IMO this is quite revolting. I support women’s only sections bc I was once that woman who didn’t want to be out in the main area. It was comforting to know I had an area for me. However, the gym I currently go to has the same decor whether you are out in the open or in the ladies which is the way it should be! Blatant stereotyping.|I’d be more curious to see the equipment in there than the colours.  Decor is a VERY small part of it.  If I were to go there, I likely wouldn’t give a crap what it looked like if it was quality work; I’d care more about the equipment inside.  I don’t even know the colours of the walls inside the women’s only area at evolution lol.|Ewwww, kind of unfortunate, but at the same time if it really is ""women only"" I guess they definitely made it look the part.|100%. To me the only difference in a women's area should be smaller and different types of equipment (sized and meant for female body types etc.) and simply as a private space to work out away from occasional pervy people that may be in common areas...|Nah I don't think you're being sensitive. That room feels condescending to me.|I meaaannnnn I love flowers and girly colours 😂 But they most definitely missed the mark. I want to feel like a strong, badass bitch who raps out loud and don't give no f*%]s when she works out, not like a daycare worker 🙆‍♀️ I refrained from turning this into a long philosophical argument, for now 😂|You look great!! Havent seen your posts lately|Great post!!! 💪🏼😬|It’s a gym. It’s paint. It’s some walls. The fact that it’s not empowering to YOU. Is because of YOU. And you alone can  yourself feel empowered. I think you just wanted to rile people up and have them agree with you. Lots of ladies love the gym why can’t you accept that? And what about it would you change? Make it Greg and bleak and monotoned? That’s really weird. There are places in the world where women can’t even ha e a gym to workout in and you get one just like that. The way you say: “I’m grateful..BUT” that initial “but” negates the entire first half of your sentence. So really you’re not grateful or appreciative. Someone from my hometown Africa would love to have a women’s gym conveniently.|All y’all have first world problems and complaining about your privilege many women would LOVE to live|Just had this same thought in my gym! In no way is it pastels & flowers... but we should be EMPOWERING women to be comfortably anywhere. Not locked in a room segregated from everyone else. I love working out in the general area but there was not a single female there... guys were looking at me like “why is she here” . It turns the gym into a guys vs. girls areas. Whether they say that or not.|I couldn’t agree more @kalliyoungstrom  the gym wasn’t my fav and I checked out the women’s only spot(which I was surprised they’d even have that). And I couldn’t agree more that I felt it was very stereotyped. I couldn’t agree more it’s good to have but I think they couldn’t of went about it differently|Would DEF not work out there🤦🏻‍♀️|I’m fortunate enough to grow up playing sports and being super active I’ve never felt uncomfortable in the gym to have to go to a women’s only side.  I always sympathized with the males that didn’t have anywhere to go. I’m sorry I don’t want to sounds rude, but that’s a joke. Empower, with pastel and flowers. I’m not a delicate flower, how embarrassing.|You get what you want yet still have to look for reasons to complain.|In this era, why is there a need for segregated areas?|🙄 @kalliyoungstrom didn’t even check out the weights and machines before complaining about the paint and flowers?! Like seriously?! “Empowered women” don’t jump at every opportunity to throw a hissy fit over the damn colours on the wall. Stand up for bigger issues and leave the women’s only section to the ones who appreciate the space, pastels and all. YOU’RE MAKING US LOOK BAD 🤦‍♀️|To me it kind of looks childish and delicate not strong or confident how I want to feel. Definitely missed the mark 😑|thanks for the review havent used that location yet|Honestly the pastel colors would make me feel less “empowered”, haha, guess because I’m not so much of a girly girl.. I know some women do feel like they almost have to hide from guys while working out, but I’m the opposite. It doesn’t bother me, I love lifting wherever and with whoever, and esp. when that means lowering the pin a notch or 2, or adding a few more 45’s to the leg press- after I know a guy’s just been there; it’s like the 🍒 on top 😂|I personally think it should look like the rest of the gym. I am by no means offended that it looks like that but it just looks like a childish space to me. 😂 it kind of makes it seem like they were trying to make the space more dainty looking for women 😂|Well we are delicate flowers|The pastels would not make me feel strong. To me this doesn’t bring the power of equality. I’ve never been girly, a military girl through and through, so for me I would want the energy and “masculine” aesthetics, not some frilly dainty room for me to hide in and feel less than.",330

Google this or jog your memory and you notice Millionaire and Billionaire MEN who embraced it and have been praised by the press for it...
I bet you can't think of one Female example as prominently noticeable...
How is it that Men can wear one type of outfit for life and be called Efficient while Women still struggle to be accepted with minimalism???
The endless quick fashion for women is far too high compared to the same old menswear with barely any variations...
There is an entire Corporate Ecosystem SURVIVING on the fact that Women will buy more than Men because they are pressured more to constantly EVOLVE their look...
Do you think WOMEN (who want) should be able to embrace clothes for Comfort and Efficiency rather than wear Everything just to ""Fit IN"" the social norms of Beauty and Acceptability???
While some clothing innovations like Gymwear that won't let you Jiggle and Bras for every location have been a boon to Womenkind, there are some clothing options that we just Don't Need for the sake of being Trendy...
Women (even those who aren't a celebrity) Deserve to be Judged based on their Work rather than how they fashionably Present Themselves to the WORLD !!!

68,"END GENDER STEREOTYPING

Today on my way to town, the cab driver started a quarrel with another cab driver. After much exchange of harsh words, my cab driver suddenly called the other ""ashawo-prostitute"" and the guy in the passenger seat started laughing and asked if a man can be a prostitute. He laughed long and hard emphasizing that he has never known or heard a man to be called that. 
People, why have we tagged #prostitution to a female? funny enough I searched for the meaning of prostitute and #wikipedia wrote; a person, especially a #woman who... Why??? I even searched online for what the men who take the ""prostitutes"" are called, all I could see was player, bad guy, womanizer etc. one wrote, ""male prostitute"". So a female is a prostitute and a #male is a male prostitute, is the act different? why not call them all same thing? better still call the female a female prostitute. 
Well, since the men can't be called #prostitutes as it has been stereotyped to a #female, perhaps we will call them BROSTITUTES. YES! What they are doing is BROSTITUTION, they are BROSTITUTING. ×WHY will a woman be caught for prostituting and the males will not? It's like they weren't there, perhaps they did it in the spirit.
×WHY will a woman be condemned for sleeping around, did she sleep with an animal?
×WHY will a female be ruled out when she commits, and when it comes to the guys they'll say, #boyz will always be boyz?
×WHY will a man be told not to get married to a lady he's had sextual intercourse with, then who will marry her? (true story)?
×WHY don't we strike a balance? 
Let's by the old saying call a spade a spade and not a garden fork.
This is only a scenerio, there are many #stereotypes we place on women and men alike. 
#Train up a #child in the way... not a female child in the way...

70,"Body image issues seem to be taboo for men to talk about because heaven forbid a male express any emotion or vulnerability, or not be a cocky concoction of testosterone. 
Since I was young I was never comfortable in my own skin, wearing a T-shirt to the beach and generally ashamed of my body. Along with this I really didn’t know how to love myself or accept myself. 
What I feel we need as a society is to embrace men of all body types, what we need is for the media to depict men of all shapes and sizes and to depict them in as desirable. 
As well as depicting men as sensitive beings with feelings and we need to broaden the spectrum of masculine and change what society believes that to be. 
How many plus size male models/ actors or singers can you name? Or simply males who aren’t buff? Or don’t have abs? 
The human body comes in all shapes and sizes and I want every human being to know this. 
I am now happy with my body and content with my soul. Some days are struggles though I accept and love myself for who and how I am. I may change and I am okay with that. I know that every day brings different contrasting challenges and I am okay with that. I’m present in this life and I’m ready to roll with the waves. 
In this life I want to create a change for the new souls coming into this society, to have the opportunity to love themselves for who, how and what they are. The only way I know how to do this is by being open about my own journey. Another communication method is my music which is like my journal and my own healing method that helps me get through every day. ♥️

73,"Cerita dari @oct4vian

#day8 Apa yang terlintas di pikiranmu ketika melihat dua orang perempuan mengenakan baju yang berbeda seperti ini? Apakah kamu langsung menilai mereka dengan suatu standar yang kamu yakini? Atau, kamu memilih untuk tidak berspekulasi dan menghindari berkomentar?
.
Kawan, sesungguhnya kedua hal itu bisa menunjukkan seberapa terbuka dam teredukasinya pikiran kamu.
.
Jika kamu masih menilai orang dari cara mereka berpakaian, kamu harus waspada! Jangan-jangan kamu sudah termakan oleh faham-faham tertentu yang tidak pernah bisa dibuktikan secara holistik pada setiap kasus, atau kamu telah menjadi bagian dari keberhasilan media dalam membentuk opini masyarakat, dalam hal ini tentang perempuan.
.
Cara berpakaian adalah salah satu pilihan seseorang yang tidak bisa dijadikan standar penilaian apakah orang itu A, B, C, D atau E. Sebab siapapun bisa dan boleh berpakaian seperti apa yang ia mau, dan itu tidak pernah menjamin apapun tentang orang itu.
.
Mengenakan burka TIDAK SAMA dengan teroris dan fanatis.
Mengenakan pakaian biasa TIDAK SAMA dengan kafir apalagi gampangan.
Mengenakan pakaian terbuka TIDAK SAMA dengan pelacur ataupun tukang pamer.
.
Jika kamu tidak mengenalnya, tidak mengerti hidupnya, tidak tahu latar belakangnya, kamu tidak berhak menilainya. Jangan mengkotak-kotakkan orang hanya karena cara berpakaian, penampilan, atau bentuk fisiknya! Tidak ada kata baik atau buruk. Ingat, satu paham saja tidak cukup untuk menggeneralisir penilaian terhadap individu. Sebab dunia ini punya banyak sekali paham. Jangan kita jadi katak dalam tempurung yang menilai sesuatu dari satu sudut pandang saja. Biarkan perempuan bahagia dengan pilihan mereka masing-masing. Yuk, hargai setiap orang, hargai pula pilihannya.
.
STOP JUDGING!!

77,"“When I joined Tinder, I was ridiculed. But it was worth it because on the 8th November 2017, we swiped. For the next 6 days we spoke every day for 12 hours. He was from Jaipur & I, Mumbai, but we’d sleep at 4.30 am & be back on the phone by 8.30–we’d even eat together while video calling! Everyone thought we were crazy! 
On the sixth day I decided that I needed to meet him, so I purchased air tickets to Rajasthan. I lied & said that I was visiting my mom. He was speechless when I told him the truth. 
Seeing someone in person is different, but when we met, it was amazing. He was sweet chivalrous & perfect. Our connection was so strong that it didn’t feel new to be with him. I gelled with his family too! We spent all our time talking. The night before I left, he said, ‘I want you in my life–it as a friend, live-in partner or wife.’ And I agreed–I had no doubts. 
Our relationship only grew stronger. We met twice a month, in Jaipur & Mumbai. Earlier we both didn’t want to leave our homes. His job was there & my family was here. But slowly, he got used to Mumbai & decided to move here, which people found odd. He started looking for a job. At an interview when he said he moved for his wife, they laughed! But, he’s never expected me to compromise because I’m a woman–he didn’t ask me to leave my life here & that’s something I admire. 
We got ritually married in July. The day after he moved in, we performed a Graha Pravesh for him–it’s normally done for the woman… but, we’re equals.  We consider ourselves as one so the roles of ‘husband’ & ‘wife’ never mattered.
We’ve broken many traditions this way. Currently I’m earning & he’s looking for work. Many relatives have said he’s a ‘burden’ on me because he doesn’t earn. How does it matter? He does the chores & fixes things in the house, something I’m not inclined to do. He’s planning to start his own business, till then I’m supporting him. People have said nasty things about us because of all this. Truth is, we pretend to be modern & accepting but when the roles actually reverse, everyone gets uncomfortable. But we’re happy with the way everything is–we’re madly in love & absolutely nothing else matters beyond that.”",genderstereotype,"|@anjalisaini2410 Keep on swiping bro😂|@nisha.rchandran|@archishasingh9|It's so amazing to read something like this!

My husband and I met on a matrimonial site completely disillusioned by the sick people we were meeting/speaking to until we found each other. We bonded over food, football and Taher Shah.😁 I get it when she says that they would be on the phone all the time, coz we were too. It was exhilarating - even when we fell asleep while talking. It's been almost 2 years since we got married, just like this couple we are in it as equals. I earn more than he does and that has never been a bone of contention between us, even though it raises eyebrows. We are happy and that's all that matters.

.
I wouldn't dare claim to be an exceptional driver but I am sure I am not the worst you could find.
.
In all of my driving years the words that have hurt the most are ""woman driver"".
.
A driver is a driver! Does not have to be discriminated into categories based on gender!
.
if I am driving bad, blame me not my gender. .
There are facts and researches proving the difference between a male and a female brain, but that doesn't make up for you to criticize the entire gender race. I have seen men with horrendous (very horrible) driving skills but never seen anyone tag him as a ""man driver"" ,make a wrong move or turn and everyone in the traffic is sure that it was a ""woman driver"".
.
So not a request but a gentle reminder, There is no such attribute as ""man driver"" or ""woman driver"".
.
Next time you notice someone driving all wrong then that person is a ""bad driver"", that's it!
.
This post comes from a sad place, i have been subjected to this kind of prejudice and I am sure so have others - either victimised  or been a victim to gender stereotype. .
what's your story?
.
.
p.s/Disclaimer :- I wasn't driving, nor was I stationed at a traffic signal when I clicked this picture. I was in a parking lot waiting for someone

87,"On September 16th, we participated in the workshop 「ジェンダーで考える、優しい社会」. By listening to a panel discussion by guest speakers, we were able to explore three different aspects (1. women and identity, 2. Sexual violence, 3. Gender stereotypes) and further enhance our “research” after our action project. 
We were surprised to see that half of the participants were male, contrary to the all-female environment we had been in in the prior workshops. When one male participant was asked his reasonings behind his interest in the workshop, he responded: “I am eager to learn more about the issues surrounding gender. By doing so, I can become more cautious of my actions and ensure that I do not say or do things that upset others. I believe spreading awareness is imperative in creating a more inclusive community.” #gender #stereotype #doublestandards #unfair #double #standards #genderstereotype #wordoftheday #bias #girls #boys #equality #japan #tokyo #learnthisword #女子力 #女性 #男性 #女子 #男子 #ジェンダー #ステレオタイプ #ジェンダーステレオタイプ #言葉 #平等 #ダブル #スタンダード #ダブルスタンダード #二重基準",genderstereotype,|写真の撮り方上手いですね❗👌頑張って投稿してください。楽し|Wow incredible!!👏🏼👏🏼,15

91,"It’s nearly Halloween, and I’ve been thinking about monsters.
Why are there so few female monsters? 
Is it because women are supposed to be beautiful, sexually attractive or maternal? And these stereotypes don’t fit with a hideous beast or terrifying gorgon? Are we really so limited in our expectations of femininity that we can’t conceive of a monstrous female? 
There are a few from ancient myth and legend but, beyond the occasional sexy vampire, in recent times we’re limited to Shrek’s Princess Fiona or Celia in Monsters, Inc. And both characters play supporting roles to their male lover’s storyline. 
We need more female monsters. We need to celebrate strong, hideous, morally-corrupt, potent women who exist outside of societal, gendered norms and independent of any male narrative. 
So, this Halloween, don’t choose the sexy witch costume. Don’t opt for an alluring vampire queen or cutesy black cat. Dress up as the most repulsive, terrifying, evil monster you can and relish the power that stepping outside expectations can provide.

93,"I absolutely hate seeing memes telling me what I want or who or what I should be.  You know the ones. ""Real men like women with curves"" or ""real men hold doors open for women"". Gender stereotypes have been ingrained in us since the early Disney days. Princesses are typically young, fragile and weak, until their macho Prince Charming comes riding in offering a happily ever after. When you look closely at these story lines they teach women to be dependent on men, and men to be assertive in nature, in order to get the girl, of course. This story line of the female pining after and finally being saved by the man has evolved into much of our present day television culture. Sadly, it has affected the way we date.

.
I was sitting with #babyT in the garden  of our society and she came and sat beside us.I wished her, as usual, and the first thing she said, ""Pua te heithile bhala hei thanta !"" which translates to, it would have been good,  if  she was a boy.
.
I didn't see it coming and I kept mum for a while. She quickly reiterated i.e because #babyT has less hair on her head.🤦
.
Another lady, who has twin boys, whom I regularly meet just like the other lady was passing by and said ""Arre wah! Aaj toh mummy ne frock pehnaya hai!"" .
.
The series of events were unexpected but this definitely triggered parenting woes for me. Am I expected to dress up my baby in frocks to let people know that she is a girl? Having less hair, facial features like a boy are not according to the standards of this society we live in.

I know this judgmental attitude is hard to scrape off but why does it have to be at all.

111,"【SZW Vocabulary】
溫柔(wēn róu)= tender / tenderly
-
👨：老師說話很溫柔（lǎo shī shuō huà hěn wēn róu)。
(The teacher speaks tenderly. )
-
「老師」(lǎo shī) means teacher.
「說話」(shuō huà) means speak/talk.
-
In traditional Asian society, females are asked to be tender, and males are asked to be brave.
It’s a typical gender stereotype.😞
Some mean people will even say unfriendly words to those who are different from the gender stereotypes in their mind.😡
For example,
「娘炮」(niáng pào)= sissy
「男人婆」(nán rén pó)= masculine woman
The words above are really impolite.
Fortunately, we seldom heard these words in our daily life nowadays.
It means gender stereotype is decreasing, more and more people learn that everyone is unique.💕

127,"One day, a friend of mine told me that she's the son of her house. I asked her, how is that?
She told me that she started earning at a very young age and gave financial support to her family.
Her father calls her 'Sher beta!' Another day, a few relatives of mine had come home. My brother is very fond of cooking. He prepared a starter and asked me to taste and check if everything is in proportion before he could serve them.
At this point, my aunt interrupted stating-
'He's like the woman of the house cooking for everyone, and you are like the man of the house critically appreciating his food.' and she chuckled.
However I didn't find it funny at all.

Do you think that calling your daughters your son will make them proud? It will only make them feel that this job is more suitable for a man, that it would have been better had their genitals been different.

Genitals- that's the biological difference between male and female. How do you associate a certain characteristics other than biology to that?
'If you have the body of a male- you're the bread earner. If you have the body of a female- you're the home-maker.' Who made these rules, why did they make them? Why do they impose these rules upon us? I don't wish to live my life abiding by your rules that are literally baseless.

You can earn well and still be a woman.
You can cook good food and still be a man.

Dear parents,
Before making your child a strong man or an obedient woman, make them a good human.

Terrible Two’s have hit us! And this moody little Ms. A is at her mischievous-best these days. One minute she will be all chirpy and fun and would laugh for no reason and the other minute she would cry and be grumpy over an issue as small as not changing her tee-shirt. But with all the hard time she gives me, she also melts my heart with this naughty giggle of hers.
.
Btw, did you notice her super cute tee-shirt? This rocket-tee (as she calls it) is her current favorite! I usually find girls' clothes with stars, sparkles and fairies. Finally could see one brand that's different! Featuring here @tinydreamers.in - a brand that inspires little girls to dream beyond princesses. They offer books and tees which are all about 4 little girls who achieve their own dreams, in a fun way. After all kids want to be what they see! And in this gender-stereotypical world what's a better message to give to your little girl than to wear her heart on her sleeves and be what she wants to be!

The tee is light and soft in fabric and super comfortable to wear in this hot summer weather! Thank you @tinydreamers.in for sending this across. Head to their page guys and check out their wonderful collection. .

135,"***Gender Stereotyped Toys***
My daughter is 5 and my son is 2. Like normal siblings they play well together and also fight like hell 🙄. My daughter loves her dolls, Barbies, babies and make up. Playing “mums and dads”, teachers (basically any role to tell her wee bro what to do!). I love this and I encourage it because it brings out her soft and nurturing side. It also shows her leadership skills (teacher) and skills of guidance. My son likes to play with all of the above too and I love it. I love seeing my son cradle a baby doll and sing “go to sleep” over and over again. I want him to grow up knowing he can be soft, caring, sensitive AND strong.
.
My son is also obsessed with football, cars, “shooking” his guns, Star Wars, lightsabers etc and that is great. He’s full of fun and energy and a little mental. Not so much fun when he whacks me with his lightsaber *wooden spoon*. I love it even more when my daughter joins in too. Seeing her score goals, climb walls and get muddy and mucky. She’s in her element when she’s set free!!
.
It’s hard to get the balance and we all fall into the gender toy trap sometimes. I think it’s just important that kids are playing and having fun. At some point life will get serious. To be honest, some days I just want to forget my responsibilities and just play football and barbies with my babies 😊

148,"I was on Groupon looking for spas In the section of beauty and I saw this. As a young woman, I didn't even know this existed and it was so openly talked about or advertised. In a microsecond I thought ""so am I ok by the standards or what?"". It creates the question in your mind -at a conscious or unconscious level- about something that was not even a concern to you. What about men? I didn't see anything for men, no surgeries that could imply their penis could be better looking. There should be though. They are not all the same -just like women's vaginas- and certainly they are not all perfect. What are we going to do about them? We need to create more questions and concerns in men's heads in order to be ""equal"". Don't you think?

150,"#thankyoumidwife ‼️ I come from a culture whereby midwives are not commonplace. In fact when I found out I was pregnant I immediately searched for a gynaecologist.  But to my surprise 💥 that’s not the practice here in France 🇫🇷. I needed to make an appointment with a #midwife #sagefemme, and so I did. She saw me to my 7th month of #pregnancy whereafter I was transferred to the hospital 🏨 of my choice to meet their midwives and start the preparations; such as consult with an anaethetist (which hilariously I thought I wouldn’t need - oh how wrong I was💉💉💉💉💉💉), as well as pre natal (preparation de accouchement) classes 🤰🏼🤰🏼🤰🏼with the most incredible midwife who did everything for us in English and gave us support beyond all expectation. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
.
.
I was initially terrified 😱😱😱😱to give birth in France, not speaking the language very well. I visited a private hospital thinking it would be better but I left in tears because I found it so gloomy. Then I was faced with visiting the hospital I had been warned against, only to find a maternity ward so spectacular it left me wondering why people feel the need to give negative advice to perfect strangers. I visited the hospital once before delivery with a bad headache, and met some of the midwives, one of which was a man. 👨🏻‍⚕️
.
.
Now not to #genderstereotype and freak out the PC brigade, but I was very uncomfortable at the thought of having a male midwife, as I thought “How could he possibly know what #childbirth could be like”. I even mentioned my fears to the head of the ward. .
.
‼️fast forward to delivery day / or should I say TWO days. I arrived on the Saturday having to be induced at 41w6d, and by the time Sunday rolled round I had been in the hands of approximately 6 midwives. By the time I FINALLY got my epidural after 17 hours of sheer agony just trying to get to 3cm, I was now with a male midwife... with his best English his attentiveness to my needs and pain we’re more than I could have asked for. However, at 7cm and almost time for delivery, his shift ended 😭😭😭 and in came, you guessed it, ANOTHER MALE MIDWIFE... cont. in comments",genderstereotype,"|... and I thought “oh but I just got used to the last one”.... cont. in comments 
But in came... my HERO! My legs were completely dead at this point and with his strength and my husband’s support they were able to rotate me to help the epidural move around (one side was still feeling the contractions), he taught me how to push in a matter of seconds (and made me forget about all the “breathe your baby out” mumbo jumbo I had been YouTubing for months), and just when I thought I’d be wheeled off for a c section, he gave me another chance to go for it, and together with immense determination, and the assistance of the OB and her ventouse, out popped my baby boy with a giant head and 4.25kgs. 👶🏼👶🏼👶🏼👶🏼👶🏼👶🏼👶🏼 In the days following my birth, I had to stay in hospital for 5 days until his weight leveled out or increased, I had all sorts of maternity nurses popping in and out recording how many times I had fed him, doing genetic tests, hearing tests, blood sugar tests, jaundice tests ... the list goes on. And the only person who came in and told me I was breast feeding correctly and helped me gain the confidence was THE SAME MAN WHO DELIVERED MY BABY! My hero midwife! I don’t know his surname but his name was Eli at St Julien en Genevois. 
We’ve sent a letter and thank you cards to the hospital but #Pampers is donating £1 for every #thankyoumidwifecampaign post to the Royal College of Midwives. Unfortunately it doesn’t go to the French midwives but I wanted to do my part to communicate the value of midwives so they may never die out.|#pregnancy #doula #midwife #inspirepregnancy #baby #pregnant #labour|Wow, powerwoman pushing through! And great story to tell!",54
151,"*Rant alert* I got quite a few comments yesterday about my middlest. He decided he wanted to wear a hair clip and carry his big sister's Elsa doll around with him. But I was shocked at people's reaction to it. I had people asking me ""is he ok with that?"" or ""why is he wearing that?"". Some even said to him ""they are for little girls"" or ""boys don't play with dollies"". In my eyes, he's happy, he's doing no harm, so why shouldn't I let him carry on? Gender stereotyping really does piss me off. Let kids be kids. Let people be who they want to be. It's not your life. It doesn't affect you. You are entitled to your opinion but keep it to yourself - it is likely to do more harm than a 2 year old wearing a hair accessory!

155,"It is this weekend. A gist of what I have worked on. 
Open Arms, Open Mind, Open Hearts: - It began with the sun providing refuge to earth within its solar system. Earth in return became home for its organisms - creating a nature which continues to nurture humans. Bombs, Sarin, blood, survival are some of the words these kids never need to know, but have to deal with it everyday of their lives. Learn from our parents, the sun and the earth, it’s now our turn to welcome the refugees with open arms..
- Pink is for girls. Blue is for boys. Barbie is for girls. Cars are for boys.. Everything under the sun goes in one of the buckets.. Even emotions like valor and sensuality.. But who exactly came up with this categorization?? First step towards opening minds. - My body was violated. Soul tarnished. I was left in pieces. Sticking it all together is impossible. Maybe opening hearts and looking into their own souls would have saved me?

157,"“Silence ensures that history repeats itself” Erin Gruwell.
.
There is a gender stereotype that women are meant to stay quiet and not question authority. They should be seen and not heard (the same is often said about children).
.
Research indicates (and you can obviously find a piece of research that contradicts this) that women assume their performance will get recognised if they do a good job.
That their potential will get be spotted, if they deliver the results.
That all is fair and 'just' when it comes to succession planning, calibration, reward and recognition.
.
Sometimes it is. Often it is not.
Unconscious bias creeps in at every turn.
.
Leading loudly is not about who shouts the loudest.
It is not about volume.
It is about integrity and truth.
It is about content.
It is about speaking up. 
It is being seen AND being heard.
It is speaking truth to power.
.
We need to see our real leaders and we need to hear you.
The world needs you to lead loudly.

It is not about causing trouble it is about making MsChief.

175,"Here is my cousin's homework on analyzing gender bias in Disney movies. Substansinya apa saja, sila perbesar gambarnya. Adik sepupu saya saat ini siswa kelas 9 di SMP internasional. Biaya masuknya Rp100 juta, iurannya hampir Rp25 juta per semester (lima kali lebih mahal daripada uang kuliah saya). Dia sungguh beruntung karena bisa teredukasi isu penting ini sejak usia dini. Sedangkan saya dan anak-anak lain yang tak punya akses ke sekolah bagus, bahkan baru ngerti betul apa itu konsep ""gender"" seutuhnya pas kuliah--itu pun kalau institusi dan dosennya ""waras"". Syukur-syukur jika orang tuanya feminis. Apakah kita harus jadi orang kaya dulu supaya anak-anak kita bisa mengecap pendidikan yang melatihnya untuk berpikir tajam terhadap segala persoalan di sekitarnya? Menurut saya sih ini wajib diajarkan merata di seluruh sekolah: internasional dan nasional, swasta dan negeri, formal dan nonformal, bayar dan gratis, mahal dan murah. Sebab pendidikan itu hak semua anak. Dan substansinya mestilah yang kritis dan sadar gender. @indonesiafeminis

Well, I always thought if I had a child one day I would love it to be just like him. He's the most joyful, carefree, bucket on head wearing, running into walls laughing, living life to the full ball of unaware brilliance - affected not a jot by disapproving eyes of some or admiring looks of others.

177,"Women in oil and gas @ewenhooi -  Before I became a lifestyle blogger who swishes skirts, flicks eye-liners and rides on heels, I was this girl.
.

I was an offshore engineer who worked with and, at times, led teams of testosterone-infused colleagues. I must say that it was how I learnt most about being a woman. My tenure at sea failed to transform me into a burly, bra-burning, men-shaming chauvinist. In fact, I accept that men and women are different so that they can compliment each other.
.

Although I am capable of striking iron with a hammer and climbing vertiginous ladders in boots, it never appealed to me that a strong woman is the one doing all the DIYs at home while her man cooks in the kitchen. Why not, some might challenge. Yes but my point is that a strong woman is defined more by how she respects herself enough for others to do the same, not by how she questions the stereotyped roles.
.

Women have come a long way since the days when they were not even allowed to receive education. Yet, some traces of male superiority prevails. When a man and a woman conveys the same message in an office in a male dominated environment like at  offshore, who do you think will be taken more seriously? Honestly, sometimes it can take more effort for a woman to be trusted. And it can be for reasons as simple as her humps.
.

The experience coached me to be a woman whose words hold the same weight as men. A strong woman in my opinion is a woman who can earn the respect of men while making her opinions heard. Think Michelle Obama. .
Not to be confused with arrogance, respect for herself attracts many other strengths that she needs to overcome life's challenges. So yes, this lady offshore engineer might be still be cooking in the kitchen and changing diapers but she shall not be disrespected as she respects herself enough to not let it happen.

It is the most magical feeling and I can't wait until it gets stronger so that Jamie be in on our little secret too. This week is a big one for us as we have our 20 week scan on Friday and hopefully we'll find out the sex. I'm not massively into big pink and blue reveals so trying to come up with creative ideas to break the news - Jamie slagged me off for being oh so millennial for pondering over a non gendered, gender reveal 🙄😂",genderstereotype,"|.

181,"I love love love to watch J flip through the books, which make it look like he is reading 😂 It came as a pleasant surprise because I wasn't expecting him to do so. For one, I have heard so many #genderstereotype comments that boys can't/don't sit still and read. And because C LOVES books I don't want to use the same measure on J. He could have picked it up from us whenever we read to/with C. Nonetheless, it's a good start! He used to express his love for books by munching on them 🙄Board books are excellent for this stage when little humans are staring to be acquainted with books. .

I'm throwing it way back for #dressdownfriday today. Here I am in the 80s, fighting fires and generally being a bad-ass.

209,"Before I became a lifestyle blogger who swishes skirts, flicks eye-liners and sashays on heels, I was this girl.
.

I was an offshore engineer who worked with and, at times, led teams of testosterone-infused colleagues. I must say that it was how I learnt most about being a woman. My tenure at sea failed to transform me into a burly, bra-burning, men-shaming chauvinist. In fact, I accept that men and women are different so that they can compliment each other.
.

Although I am capable of striking iron with a hammer and climbing vertiginous ladders in boots, it never appealed to me that a strong woman is the one doing all the DIYs at home while her man cooks in the kitchen. Why not, some might challenge. My point is that a strong woman is defined more by how she respects herself enough for others to do the same, not by how she questions the stereotyped roles.
.

Women have come a long way since the days when they were not even allowed to receive education. Yet, some traces of male superiority prevails. When a man and a woman conveys the same message in a male dominated environment like at offshore, trust can be lobsided.  It can take more effort to prove that her words hold water at her workplace. And it can be for reasons as simple as her gender.
.
The experience coached me to be a woman whose words hold the same weight as men. A strong woman in my opinion is a woman who can earn the respect of men while making her opinions heard. Think Michelle Obama.
.
Not to be confused with arrogance, respect for herself attracts many other strengths that she needs to overcome life's challenges. So yes, this lady offshore engineer might be still be cooking in the kitchen and changing diapers but she shall not be disrespected as she respects herself enough to not let it happen.
.

Happy Women's Day!

Since I started cycling I've been amazed by the amount of women's specific kit/bikes etc seem to have a ""slap some pink on to make it 'girly'"" ethos behind them. Like you I personally don't mind a bit of pink sometimes but it's the connotations  that come with it and apparent lack of thought in the design that shows a huge misunderstanding of what female cyclists want. I know male cyclists who would want pink on their kit and females who wouldn't want it at all, society is more diverse than the ""blue for boys and pink for girls"" stereotype!|Pretty nice!|That's an awesome trackstand by the way ....oh hold on it's a photo....|it's just as ok to like pink as much as it is to like any other colour -but if it really was a un-gendered choice there would be just as much pink in the mens clothes as the womens.  Distribute those colours evenly!  #rainbowpeleton 🌈|@sturgelucy I don't know how I follow you tbh, but I am so glad I do now. As a fellow female cyclist this is such an amazing thing you have done. I applied for the same ambassador programme because I love bike riding and promoting women's cycling but after I applied I actually looked at the kit and I wouldn't have bought anything. So many other great brands like castelli and dhb have an amazing women's range that isn't just pink! I like a pink top or a pink accent but to told, ""you will wear pink because ur female"" is sexist and not a brand I wish to be associated with.|@sturgelucy good on you!|Wooooo awkward women stand together!|Proud of you Lucy!! Well Done!! :) xx|@sturgelucy We want to publically acknowledge the points you raised, as we did in our email correspondence yesterday. The decision to offer the kits in those colors was clumsy, and the way your concerns were (not)addressed does not meet our standard, and we’re sorry. We will make better decisions in the future. Our brand has been focused on offering quality women’s gear with dedicated pattern engineering, chamois technology and unique styles for over 30 years. We think it’s important to have an inclusive line of gear so that every rider can express themselves the way they want to. People make mistakes – and we did here. Hopefully our decades long commitment demonstrates to you and other riders that our heart is in the right place.|👌|Love it! Check out our awesome designs.|@pearlizumiofficial Appreciate your comments, here and in the emails you have sent to me. Still don't know how this was considered a good decision though?

I think he'd probably have had long hair until he was 6 too. xx|I had the same situation but in the end we get used to his new ""boy"" look|My 4 year old has the same thing always being called a girl.  But so far he's only asked to cut it once and then he changed his mind back by the end of the day when I asked him again if he still wanted it cut.|Awww darling boy. My boys always got mistaken for girls.  Eldest one cut his hair a year or so ago, little one still gets called a girl. Sending you hugs ❤ 💛 ❤|All the love to this boy! 😍|💙💙💙|And i know your feeling so well. But hair will grow. My boy wants it long again after cutting; so fingers crossed 😘|Tyler went through the same thing around 7, after he cut it for the first time short he realized that he sort of missed it.  We went through phases of cutting and growing it out since then, now he has half and half. :) I still miss his long hair too! xx|@ridasj thank you Rida! Yes, Louise and I had a bit of a chat about this on Facebook. Thank you for sharing the post with me, you are so thoughtful. Xo|Oh mama 💔 not looking forward to this if/when the time comes with iley. Hugs to you ❤️|That's exactly what happened with me and my boy! He had the longest of hairs. He looked so wild and rocking. His dad has long hair, musician and all. He was always proud of his hair but he was so sick of people saying he is a girl. So at 7 he finally ask to cut it! It was very short to us but not as short...now he is 8 it grew until his shoulders and still now and then they call him a girl. It's so annoying! I grew up in a culture where long hair in boys was common. I guess cause the whole transgender thing is blowing up all over the place it's getting confusing for people!?? But he dresses like a boy, he is a boy!! It's so annoying. It gets me really angry because I know he hates it|Oh and the day he cut it, I cry and couldn't sleep! 😢|My son finally cut his hair off when he was 6, constantly called a girl , the final straw came when he was to he couldn't join in a football game in the park because the kids said he was a girl..he went for a Mohawk! He's now 10 and grew his hair long again before cutting a new Mohawk...now I have his little brother , he's 4 and at the moment he loves his hair .. Our mama hearts ! :)|Oh my heart! I know this is in our future too. xx|@hippieindisguise ahh! I forgot about Facebook! 😘😘😘|Same thing over here. My son is 7 & is daily mistaken for a girl. Same discussions, same all. It breaks my heart only thinking of his hurt feelings! Why are people & most importantly, children so cruel?! 😢😕|Oh bless! Lovely pics to look back on to be sure 💖 Would love to see a pic when you're ready to share one x|❤️❤️❤️|Ah, hope one day he'll grow it back. They don't understand at their age that people's opinions do not matter. Or not to the point of sacrificing one's own happiness for other's whims and fancies. Hugs to you, Louise. I know how bittersweet this growing up business is xxx|💔|Aww, that is a bit sad isn't it. 😔 I sometimes ask my youngest (who has a long curls) if he still likes it that way or wants his hair short. I want him to be comfortable with himself, but I'm always secretly hoping for him to keep it long. 😌|Oh hopefully we'll see one of his new do soon though ☺️ I think I might be the only one who likes it when the little ones have a haircut and start looking grown up 🙈 I would really like to get my little girl's hair cut but she would never let me!!|Looks good. Xx|Oh I feel you on this one. Caleb's first proper cut shook me up. He left a blond baby and came back this gorgeous brown haired boy. He aged right before my eyes and I just wasn't ready. Now Archie gets mistaken for a girl daily but that fine by us 😂❤️|Ohhh, I bet that was tough for you ♥️|I bet he looks gorgeous with his short hair as well!|My boy gets mistaken for a girl quite often. He's not ready for a big cut yet, just trims here and there. I feel you, I know I'll miss his baby curls when it's time. 😊|Oh la la my seven years old today 🎉 had his long hair cut a month ago i know how you feel|always so tough, but i am sure he looks handsome with short hair too! 😊|Oh Hun, I'm sure that will happen this end soon enough. At the last hair cut I asked Bo how he wanted his hair cut, he replied 'like Bodhi' whilst looking at me like why would he have his hair cut any other way 😂 But so often he gets mistaken for a girl, luckily he's still a little too young to notice. Can't wait to see a shot with the short hair x|Wait. That's the crank handle for my car, that costs a lot of money that I don't have. Please kindly put it back in my 1910 Ford please.|Oh I know how that feels 💔 I loved my little boy's long curly blonde hair but since he was about three he's always insisted on having it cut short 😞|He's always a sunny boy no matter long or short hair. He will not only make the decision for now, but also a whole life. I love to see his all kinds of hair style because he is Jody. 💖💖💖|💔 He has the most beautiful face so after the initial shock I bet that's all you will see, I keep thinking Fin will ask to have his cut but he never has (so far) I do often wonder what he would look like with short hair though. xxx|@bunnychrysler|Are you starting to get used to it Lou? Heartbreaking, and I bet he looks so much more grown up all of a sudden. Whenever Connor has his cut short I keep having to do a double take. The main thing is he is happy with it xx|💛💛💛|Oh I can't wait to see it! Bet he still looks absolutely gorgeous... (although I can imagine the shock to the system) x|Aww, babe. I feel for you. Happy Six to Jody and congrats on raising such a self assured young fellow xxx|It's a bittersweet shame, but I really don't blame him. With a short pixie crop, it was forever frustrating to be confused as a boy, and later, a teenage boy child as I was constantly asked for ID into my 30's. Now it's bob-like, I love it, and people seem to be coming to the realisation that I am a strong force of a woman. Irritates me that it took f*ing hair to be taken seriously, but society is stupid. Hopefully your boys chop will give him the confidence to forge his own identity and be proud of it.|@loopygibbens oh man!!! I totally get you on all of that! Dreading the haircut, he doesn't want it yet but feel it coming on! 💔 Bet he looks adorable though. Yeah thank goodness we have pictures 👍🏻 x|Oh no.. my boys have longest hair ever and also ask for a haircut once in a while.

253,"In honour of WORLD PHOTO DAY I want to share a project that pushed me to my technical and conceptual limit, a subject that has always been a prominent part of my life due to my best friend being part of an industry that constantly questioned him. I worked closely with these young dancers throughout my masters project to create a series of images I will always be proud of... Here is a little blurb below that accompanied my images.

Exceptional dancers in my experience are also exceptional people, their attitude towards life and the determination to succeed is instantly apparent, especially when faced with a stage. You are then looking at the person he is and the person who, at this moment cannot help but be. 
Portraiture is used to explore issues of identity and has become a powerful encounter between artist, subject and viewer. This body of work is an intimate approach in capturing young boys amidst the training to be a professional ballet dancer. These boys are solely committed to their preparation and I am there to capture moments in this training. My work displays the idealized beauty in not only dance but also young males. Focusing on the intimate in-between moments of performance, capturing the beauty and the vulnerability these boys have in that moment of reflection. Through these intimate portraits I aim to challenge gender stereotypes and celebrate these individuals as they discover who they are.",genderstereotype,|#worldphotoday #ballet #myboycandance #mastersproject #photography #university #portraiture #dance #balletdancer #genderstereotype #love #beautiful #proud #sheffield #sheffieldhallam|Like it!,46

256,"US cultural observation: gender stereotyping.

Since moving to the US last year, we've noticed that gender stereotyping was relatively prevalent here. Initially most of our observation came from TV commercials and then slowly we noticed it too in our social settings. 
But my real culture/gender shock came when I walked into a toy store for the first time. I could very quickly and clearly distinguished which were 'girls toys' and which were 'boys toys'. Not just by colors but also by 'type' of toys, which was somewhat exasperating because I felt some of them came across as a bit demeaning in the 21st century. 
More recently S has begun telling me how somethings are only for boys and vice versa. I tried prodding her a bit more by asking why she thinks so and explaining to her that things don't have to be discriminated by sex. Of course all I get now is a blank look and the attention span of a 4 year old - literally. 😳😂 I guess this is going to be a long learning process and hopefully one day my children will understand that people are not limited by their gender or sex. That they can do whatever they put their minds to. Pink or blue or green. 💖💙💚",genderstereotype,|#GenderStereotype #Gender #Lego #children #CultureShock,16

276,"Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese artist who was born in Matsumoto, Japan in 1929. The style of her work encompasses aspects of pop art and minimalism filtered through an avant-garde lens and deployed in service of her values regarding feminism and progressive politics.

Kusama began making art at the age of ten, painting polka dot motifs using watercolor, pastels, and oil. Around the year 1957 Kusama made her way to the United States where her artistic career flourished very rapidly. Kusama participated in the hippie and feminist movements of the 1960's, in which she spoke out against female stereotypes as well as the War in Vietnam. Accumulation #2, a photograph taken in 1966, is a self-portrait of Kusama covered in dots posing seductively. The image disrupts the gender stereotype of a ""sexy"" woman. Other works made during her time in the United States used various visual media including film, with which she produced many autobiographical works such ""Kusama's Self-Obliteration"". Upon returning to Japan in 1973 Kusama began focusing on more conservative types of media such as sculpture and literature. Kusama has been shown in solo exhibitions around many parts of the world including Japan, France, USA, England, and Italy and has also been featured in a number of film festivals. Today Kusama's work can be found in collections of the world’s leading museums such as the MoMA, Centre Pompidou, and National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.

298,"I know I am way past my post limit for the day, but this REALLY made me MAD today. I went to Hallmark to look for ornaments and ended up absolutely disgusted by this gender stereotyped kids section where clearly ONLY BOYS like Superheroes and GIRLS can ONLY like Disney Princesses and things slathered in pink. Guess what, it's almost 2015 and this should have gone out way back in the 80's! MUPPET NEWS FLASH: GIRLS LIKE SUPERHEROES TOO! And not just the female characters, they like the male characters too! Girls do actually like Batman and Robin! They like The Flash, Green Arrow, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Rocket and Groot, Loki, and Thor (both genders). But your horrific pretty pretty pink Princess section doesn't even include any female superheroes! Where are Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Black Widow, Gamora, Storm, Rogue, She-Hulk, Spiderwoman, and Batgirl with her marketable to young girls new outfit? Where are any of them?! Nope, just Disney Princesses. How about male Disney characters on girl's cards?? Where are Mike and Sully? Where are Pooh, Tigger, and Piglet? And I'm guessing girls definitely aren't allowed to like Ninja Turtles or TransFormers either, huh? And what if, God forbid, a boy likes a female superhero? Or any female character from a cartoon or action movie? I mean seriously?! What is it going to take for you people to get it?! There is NO REASON a parent shouldn't be able to find their daughter a Guardians of the Galaxy card for her birthday or a Frozen card with a character other than Olaf for their son! Get with the times already because this is just sad.

I feel like if I've done 6 in a day, that's plenty. I generally shoot for 4 when I'm not involved in photo challenges.|@bl32k @deez_straps @mgarcia5159 I am a product of the 70s, grew up in the 80s and it was near impossible for my friends and family to find me birthday cards for all the ""boy"" stuff I liked; Batman, Superman, Star Wars, TransFormers, GI Joe, etc. It was just Strawberry Shortcake, Barbie, and maaaaybe Smurfs and Muppets (if they got lucky finding the latter two for girls or non-gender specific). They would literally just scratch out the word ""boy"" in the card. It's sad that 30+ years later things haven't changed at all.|The best way I've seen childhood gender equality broken down is the flow chart of ""Do you operate the toy with your genitals?"" ""Yes --> it is not suitable for children"" ""no --> it is suitable for both girls and boys"" I always wish I had a poster of that to refer to when a parent won't buy a Batman item for their girl or a MLP item for their boy. Parents of the world, letting a kid play with a harmless toy isn't going to ""mess them up."" Acting like a biggot around them might actually though.|@mad_love_hj lol, that's perfect. I recently saw a comic strip going around about Lego's new ""girl"" line of toys. In it, they're asking a woman about the new line and she says all they had to do to make Lego ""more"" appealing to girls (because it already is really) inatead of making everything pink was to add one extra piece in each set, and then she shows them the Lego ponytail/girl hair. I hope Lego sees that strip and feels stupid.|Seriously! It doesn't need to be pink to appeal to girls! To further the appeal to girls just make sure they're represented! Just that small adjustment or addition could make a huge difference for consumers and it will barely cost them a thing compared to special sets ""for girls.""|@mad_love_hj you would think with the huge craze of Monster High dolls, toy companies would at least figure out that not everything has to be pink and girly...but no. I mean, they're still dolls, but it's a step in the right direction anyway.|Agreed. Girls can like creepy things too! Every so often a company or two actually gets it and I love it when they do but sadly I'm sure it'll take a little longer. There's such a huge push for gender equality right now but if people continue to buy things like Barbie it'll continue to delay the process. The companies need to start really hurting financially to get a clue and it may even take a generation or two to get past the thinking of current CEOs and executives. As long as people continue to call companies on their bullshit, maybe they'll get the picture eventually. But given how much bullshit some of them continue to churn out (I'm looking at you DC comics) it's obvious it could take a while longer. Gender equality, in all senses, is definitely something worth fighting for even if it'll will take a while to get the point across to some of those thick-headed companies.|@mad_love_hj yeah, DC definitely hasn't figured it out...*cough*Batgirl*cough*|Exactly... Every so often I get the tiniest bit of hope they'll figure it out then NOPE. They make it worse.|speaking as a second waver, let me tell you the eighties were a rude shock after we thought we'd made progress. but there were only token female muppets (cuz the all- male puppeteers couldn't imagine otherwise) and thomas the tank engine pulled female coaches could not move on their own & the relentless pink & disney princesses &&&. so i gotta tell you, the fact that your generation is infuriated by it is one of the most hopeful signs mine has seen in a long time.|@ellenbulger I was born in the 70's, this is not my generation. And I'm mad because I never got the cool ""boy toys"" just the ""pink crap"" and that it is now 2015 and if I felt like having kids, at least where birthday cards are concerned, they'd be dealing with the same garbage.|robot. i wanted a toy robot. even the santa at the shopping center said ""wouldn't you rather have a doll?"". i never did get a toy robot, no matter how much i begged. 😠",49
