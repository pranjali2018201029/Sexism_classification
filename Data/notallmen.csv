1,1,"It's appalling that in 2019 women still carry the majority of the domestic load. And yes, I know #notallmen but you know, #mostmen get it easy when it comes to managing the domestic chores that come with family life.

​@everodsky found herself in a flood of tears when she cracked under the burden of doing it all (working as a lawyer, looking after the kids, making sure her husband had BLUEBERRIES TO EAT!!??)
​
​And so, being a smart woman and an organisational specialist, she developed a game called Fair Play, that helps to distribute all the stuff. The grocery shopping, the party dates, the school forms... her system evenly distributes it all.

Es horrible lo que ocurre con las mujeres de mi pais y opino que si hay mujeres que me odien sin conocerme por ser varon es solo un vuelto de tantos años de injusticia social hacia el genero femenino . Por otro lado si bien dudo que me violen (porque entreno para saber defenderme ) no estoy impune a 1,2,3,4 personas armadas que me quieran robar. cada vez que camino por la calle yo tambien tengo miedo y nunca tuve la mala suerte de ver una situacion fea de hombre a mujer (al menos no siendo grande ) me gustaria alguna vez cruzarme con esa situacion para poder actuar obviamente esto es solo un comentario en internet y nadie me conoce por eso me dificulta algunas veces poder interactuar con una persona pero estamos en pleno cambio y doy fe en que algun dia todo esto cambie para mejor en todo aspecto pero tampoco hay que olvidarse que si un varon esta loco esta loco y nadie lo va a saber hasta que viola , maltrata , maltrata fisicamente , moralmente pero como dije estamos en pleno cambio y va a llegar el dia donde todo esto mejore. Me gusta esta revolusion me gusta el gran cambio que tuve respecto a esteriotipos sociales.

Nuestras tasas de alcoholismo y drogadiccion son altísimas. La tasa de indigencia es 78% ( España) hombres. Los peores trabajos que un ser humano puede desempeñar son 98% hombres. Y luego si nos quejamos se nos echan al cuello porque “ a vosotros no os violan”. Y la mayor tragedia, a parte de que no podemos decir lo mierda que es nuestra vida en general, es que a las nuevas generaciones de hombres se les culpa de cosas que no han hecho. Solo por haber nacido hombres. Falta empatía por todos los lados. Pero eh, twitter y pegatinas en las mochilas sobre el feminismo sin duda van a arreglar los problemas en vuestras vidas.",350

28,28,"Obviously I had some very strong feelings watching last night’s ep of the @bacheloretteau . It was extremely uncomfortable to watch a man behave in such a derogatory manner and reading his comments today has left me scathing.
Because THIS is the very definition of “toxic masculinity”. And it must be discussed. Using your perceived “power” as a man to treat people, especially a woman, poorly only to turn around and treat it like someone else’s problem because they “can’t take a joke”. The myth that toxic masculinity refers only to physical violence or sexual assault, or that it’s a term invented by an “overly emotional” woman who hates men also needs to be firmly quashed.
I am aware that toxic masculinity is a term that often triggers people so if you are tempted to respond with anything that resembles #notallmen , I kindly ask you to step down. Because no, not all men, obviously. Most men are good men. I am lucky enough to have been raised by them, work with them, count them as some of my closest friends, and share my life with one of the very best. But there are indeed some men, and they need to be called out. 
Of course my reaction to this is based on personal experience. It’s about having to sit uncomfortably while some guy makes derogatory comments about me and my friends. Or a man I barely know making incorrect assumptions about my sex life. It’s being laughed at for getting visibly uncomfortable when a man is deliberately invading my personal space. It’s being called “princess” because I have certain expectations of my partner and father to my kids. It’s having my opinion dismissed because I’m being “just a bitch” or “must have my period”. This is toxic masculinity and it must be eradicated. Women deserve better. My daughters deserve better. My son deserves to grow up in a world where is not ridiculed for being “too sensitive” or not being “tough enough.”
I strongly applaud the other men on TV last night for standing up to such behaviour. Because that’s what real men do. And big cheers to @angiekent_ for standing up for herself and all women. Good men and women need to take a stand. Calling out and stamping out this behaviour is a win for everyone ✌🏼❤️",notallmen,|❤️|❤|Well said Jess 👏|👏🏻👏🏻|A thousand time yes!

42,42,"Ich komm gerade vom Selbstverteidigungskurs, aber meine Arme sind zu zittrig für ein Selfie. Bisschen Mitleid mit meinem Trainingspartner, an dem ich gerade die Wut über 20 Jahre lang in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln von creepy Typen wegsetzen ausgelassen habe. Jede einzelne Frau in diesem Kurs hat die Hand gehoben, als der Trainer gefragt hat, wer sowas schon mal gemacht hat. Alle anwesenden Typen so: oh. ""Männer und Frauen leben in unterschiedlichen Welten"" war sein Kommentar dazu.

Wichtigstes Learning für heute: macht nicht nichts, aus Angst, euer Gegenüber ansonsten erst recht zu provozieren. Wenn ihr nichts macht, kann er (#notallmen aber meist halt leider schon : er) das, was er vorhat durchziehen, wenn ihr euch wehrt, weggeht, andere um Hilfe bittet, gibt es zumindest die Möglichkeit aus der Situation unbeschadet rauszukommen.

49,49,"If someone you knew was mauled by a big dog, maybe more than once in their lifetime, would you pressure them to stop being cautious or scared around big dogs or would you just get it? Would you be confused if they didn’t want to spend time alone with a big dog even tho they know some big dogs are gentle and sweet? Would you try to debate them on it? Would you expect them to step into a room alone with a big dog they’d never met when you could see the scars of their attack on their body? Would you mock them for not wanting to go inside? Or would you easily understand their unwillingness to risk being mauled again? - Now replace big dog with man, and understand most women have been bitten, mauled, or escaped a very near miss, quite likely more than once in her lifetime. You see how ridiculous it is to get offended or frustrated at a woman’s unwillingness to trust you, maybe take a breath and have a a stern word with your breed instead.

67,67,"Men had defined the word ""SUBMISSION"" as slavery or servitude where women were objects of pleasure of any form.
Today the woman has emancipated herself and understood that the word did not simply mean ""ACCEPTANCE"" of an authority.
#genderbasedviolence

Accepting authority doesn't mean accepting any form of violence that man has unluckily learned to use against the feminine since time immemorial.

She wasn't fragile like a flower, She was fragile like a bomb.
Be sure that if she explodes, she will not be among the victims

I am proud of today's woman:
- Who doesn't shut up when she doesn't agree;
- Who doesn't say maybe where to say NO;
- Who gets up and speaks up when she or another woman is in danger.

75,75,"This morning I went for my penultimate 10k run before the Colwyn Bay race at the end of October. It wasn't the fastest or easiest run but I still did it. I had two interactions with people on the run today. The first was a friendly wave from an older guy in a car who I've had to jump onto the bank to avoid the car (it's a single track road) for two weeks running now. It's become a bit of in joke, if there can be such thing between a runner and a driver who have never met. Either way, I only felt encouraged by his wave.

The second, when I was less than a kilometre from home, was less encouraging. Bearing in mind that given my size and skin tone, I go RED when I run. And there's some wobble. I don't care, at that point I just want to get home and get some water. Another car goes past me, this time lads waving and honking the horn. Funnily enough I didn't recognise them and funnily enough I wasn't exactly encouraged. It made me rage.

It's hard enough running sometimes. We don't need that too. Let's be better. (If anyone's wondering what the pic is, it's from @hemmograms #runninglikeagirl book, which I probably read about four times a year for motivation and who has put this feeling into words far more eloquently than me.

82,82,"I’m talking the unpaid labour of women.
.
.

To get my writing done during school holidays I headed north on my own to Mum’s. I averaged 10-12hour days of research and writing over 12 days. I left the house 4 times. I was immersed and absorbed.
.
.

The only way I could do that as the ‘lead’ parent was to get someone to take over 90% of my maternal labour. Enter my mother who spent her time and energy doing that for me.
.
.

And in that small vignette of my life illustrates the unfair and unjust gender bias of labour.
.
.

The next couple of weeks I’m going to share a different point on this topic, illustrating how immeasurably sick Australian culture is about the de-valuing of women’s labour (paid and unpaid). .
.

My first point begins here ... In the 1890s colonisers wanting to statistically represent the development of white Australia’s economy decided to create ‘market’ and ‘nonmarket’ labour (not a new concept but they were responsible for setting it up in white Australia). White women’s domestic labour was considered ‘too difficult’ to capture. [A reframing of this is that they weren’t smart enough to consider other options]. In fact, one of these statisticians believed that a healthy robust economy was based on the idea that women didn’t ‘work’. Because women in the ‘market’ took away jobs from men. He went back and changed census data to show less women working and that there were no female ‘breadwinners’ - believing this would prove how stable white development was. 🙄
.
.

These decisions really impacted the data (and public understanding) around the work women did on farms and in small business especially. They were pivotal in shaping white Australia’s gendered division of labour. The numbers lied. 😡 .
.

These decisions made 130 years ago set the stage for what was to come ... Continued in comments ...",notallmen,"|... *I’m still in the midst of researching, though it’s likely that First Australians were ignored in his data, hiding the slave labour that white colonists relied on. *Note these ideas were based on hetero-normative assumptions. Statisticians couldn’t handle non-binary ideas of people or relationships. *This post is based on over 20 peer-reviewed articles and books covering Australian history, sociology, rural studies, feminist and women’s history. *I’ll always be on a learning journey. Even with three degrees and a PhD on the way. Still learning. I’ve benefitted in the past few years especially from intersectional feminists and from Indigenous activists and writers sharing, freely, their intellectual work.

It seems like the colonizers messed up lotsa stuff in Australia... My final essay in senior high was actually about their impact on Australian society today, in the form of racism and erasure of Indigenous stories. So that was only on a senior high level but I definitely think I'll dive into something connected to this for my thesis in English at uni. 💪🏽|I went back and read your post .. sorry I missed it.

88,88,"Recently this issue has caused drama in my personal life with some of the men closest to me. Men whom I respect, admire, trust and love. I am exasperated. I cry with frustration. I am hurt. *
“You have a lot of negative opinions.”- Yes I do. I have a negative opinion for every negative thing I have observed or experienced. I have a negative opinion for every story of every female friend or stranger I am aware of, and I have a negative opinion for many of the women who I have not heard from, but whom I know are suffering from aggression, violence and/or oppression within a patriarchal system that does not care to acknowledge women’s needs and rights as equal to those of men. *
“I’m not like that.” - Yes I know. That’s why we are friends/lovers. This is not about you, it’s actually about me and all women. *
“This is unfair.” - Again, this not about you and it’s not about being fair. It’s about women breaking their silence and giving men information about what our lives are like. The female reality. The Woman’s World within the Man’s World. It’s about women giving men the opportunity to learn and be better, to LISTEN TO WOMEN. *
“You hate men.” - No I don’t. If I see something, I say something. I stand up for  myself. I talk back to men. I tell them that what they’re doing is not ok. I talk about experiences I have had. I know right? The sheer QUANTITY of these experiences might make it seem like I hate men. Once again, I don’t. But I am angry, tired and my heart hurts every day because even though women like me, are speaking up and sharing our pain, our shame, and our desire for change, men do not want to listen to us. They only want to defend themselves personally and distance themselves from the problem at large. Men refuse to acknowledge that no matter how they personally behave toward women, simply because they are a man, and this world was built to progress the desires of men, that they too are a part of the problem. *

Plus trolls lol. Thank you for your posts and content. I relate all too often 💜|❤️💯|Yes!

123,123,"#tw: #violence, attempted assault

This is what #toxicmasculinity looks like.

Most people see an abandoned two liter bottle of Pepsi, but I see my life flashing before my eyes when some guy driving in a Porsche threw it at my head while I was biking today. Why would a man purposefully throw a half filled bottle of Pepsi at me while I try to enjoy a nice bike ride? Oh, no reason really. Just that he didn't appreciate me shutting down his sexual advances. His ego was bruised, so he chucked this at me, swerved into the bike lane, then tried to brake check me before speeding off. Luckily for me, every attempt he made to physically harm me failed, but y'all... it is 2019. Violence is completely ingrained in our existence in the United States, so much so that a substantial portion of the population sees nothing wrong with what happened to me, nor with what happens to women every few minutes. I could have lost my life today because of the toxic masculinity perpetuated by our violent patriarchal society. I'm a survivor, but there is an ever growing list of women not as fortunate as me, especially women of color and trans women who experience even higher levels of violence both systemically and day to day.

So tell me... if you think things should change, what are you doing about it? Or are you part of the problem.",notallmen,"|Sorry to hear about this. Glad you're okay|Jesus wtf!!!

128,128,"CAUTION: Extremely personal and potentially upsetting post. .

Don’t be fooled by appearances. A cute backdrop, a brightly dressed girl, but we all have bad memories. .

This hotel is the site of my #MeToo story. 1 in 6 women has been sexually assaulted, and it’s extremely important for men in particular to know that this isn’t just a statistic, this is something happening to women you KNOW (even if it’s ones from the internet). .

5 years ago, I was out in Scottsdale and had quite a bit to drink (this DOES NOT MEAN IT WAS MY FAULT). I was told by a male “friend” that there was an afterparty at the Saguaro and that after party turned out to be a version of me that could barely stand and that man alone in a room. All I remember is I could hardly stay awake and didn’t have the fight in me to push this man away or leave. It wasn’t a textbook rape, but it’s a grey area I’ve never felt comfortable with, especially because of the dishonest circumstances that led me there. I’ve been afraid to speak up because it seems like less than others’ experiences, but it still made me feel taken advantage of without FULL consent. I barely drink now, because I do not feel I can let loose without the potential for a man to take advantage of me. .

So why am I sharing this? One, it’s important to know that most sexual assaults aren’t strangers in the night grabbing you in a dark alley. Most incidents are by someone the victim knows, and this was a person I considered a good friend. Two, nearly every adult woman has a #MeToo story, even if it’s catcalling, being followed/harassed, or receiving crude DMs. I had been roofied before this incident, too. .

Three, I am happy if this even opens up the eyes of one man or makes one woman feel heard. Men, tell dudes to knock it off. WE GET IT - Not All Men. But it’s ENOUGH men that nearly every woman has experienced some sick situation. Men are way more likely to listen to other men, especially if they are made to feel ashamed of their actions. .

Four, this is a cute backdrop, and I’m not going to let any bad memories stop me from shooting here, because that experience doesn’t own me. It’s not my identity. And it isn’t yours.",notallmen,"|@linzolson awful to hear!

I know it will help others on both sides of the coin understand. When I started dating again, post divorce, I was stunned to learn how many of the women I went out with had been sexually assaulted. It really was shocking to me.|😲🤒🔥😍🔥|I am sorry 😢. This is a disgusting event,I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  The thought of a person being taken advantage of, manipulated, tricked, or mislead and lied to makes me sick. The men or people who do such things can't be put in the same category. If they thought of such a horrible thing to do,  there is no way to convince their sick mind different.  They are sick in the head, they have no heart. My opinion is once they lose the compassion and respect for the others personal space, they don't have a place here on earth. I have stopped these perverted sick people,  beaten them to just barely a breath left. ........ they do the same shit,  they only get better at hiding it. I am happier than you could even imagine, that you are strong and look past a lot to help yourself heal.

You are very brave to share this, as there is so much victim shame programming that is poured into our minds from a young age. I remember a horrible incident that I had in the first grade w a man trying to coaxe me into following him into a building & to this day I can recall this paralyzing feeling of shame that I felt. Should I call for help, should I tell my parents? All of a sudden I felt to dirty for no logical reason. Only as an adult did I realize how deep this programming actually went that it was present in the mind of a 7 year old. All we can do is make sure that we instill in young girls (and boys) the idea that our bodies are sacred, they belong to us & the only ones at fault are those who trespass our space.

Every story helps someone and it can also help the person who is sharing it too. I think you sharing this shows how strong you are and how far you have come. I haven’t been able to share mine yet and it was 9 years ago. It took me 3 years to tell just one person whom I deeply trusted and I still haven’t been able to share it publicly. This is actually my first time writing #metoo. So thank you for sharing your story. If you are feeling any kind of anxiety over your post, please know that you helped at least one person take a step toward healing. I’m sure it will help many others too. 💕|Some pretty scary stuff. Sorry that happened to you 😕|Wow Linz. I’m sorry. This is such a strong post and it takes courage to share this.

133,133,"This is such an important initiative by @deartamilmen. While long overdue, it’s so important that tamil men start challenging the harmful narratives and patriarchal structures that afflict society. A lot of the comments on the original post are familiar to most people. Many of us who’ve been privileged enough to be exposed to the discussions around “#notallmen” know why it’s a flawed premise. Not everyone has that privilege and many are mostly exposed and conditioned to the toxic patriarchal structures of the world around us. It’s up to us to counter these arguments and I look forward to @deartamilmen’s work on this. Dear Tamil Men, please do post this yourself and encourage the conversation amongst your peers. This isn’t attack on every single Tamil man, but a challenge to the dominant patriarchal culture which harms the entire community. The Tamil liberation struggle must encompass this struggle too - otherwise it’s not true liberation.

So please post @deartamilmen’s message or your own anti-patriarchal post. The message needs to get out and the conversations must be had. Every single one of you that challenges the patriarchy makes a difference.",notallmen,|🙏🏽🙌🏾|👏🏾|👏🏽🙌🏽|Thank you for this brave post. I honestly believe that part of the problem is the intense pain felt by men who have no path to expression. Things such as crying or feeling sadness are seen as weak (at best) or non-masculine (at worst). To reverse these outdated concepts it’s time to allow men to feel that pain publicly and even comfort them. This does not take away from the terrible pain felt by any other gender (often due to violence propagated by Tamil men themselves). Pain begets pain into a vicious cycle. And because men still hold the power the top of the food chain itself starts with pain. By allowing men to embrace their feminine aspects and heal we can move forward more gracefully. It’s ok if the conversation amongst men focuses on men. But it’s not ok when that conversation dismisses pain and sadness through misogyny. This is our responsibility- of course - but coordination with other genders will get us to the goal much faster and far more unified. Much love and peace. Too much trouble in the world for something this terrible to happen again. Not on our watch. 🙏🏾|👏🔥,155

Für alle, die noch nicht wissen, was das ist, hier noch mal Teile des berühmten Comics von @emma_clit (In der Story gibt es den ganzen Comic!). Das sind Begriffe für all die kleinen organisatorischen Dinge rund um den Haushalt und die Familie, die fast immer die Frauen übernehmen: Arzttermine, neue Kleidung kaufen, Milch kaufen, Nägel schneiden, Playdates ausmachen, Geburtstage organisieren, Geschenke kaufen. Familienmanagement ist harte Arbeit und zusätzlich zum Haushalt / der Kindererziehung / der Berufstätigkeit kann das wahnsinnig belastend sei, vor allem weil diese Arbeit unsichtbar ist und meist nicht mal von den Frauen selbst anerkannt wird.

156,156,"Neuer Blogtext

Wenn ich Vorträge zum Thema #MentalLoad halte, kommen öfter Frauen auf mich zu, die fragen wie sie mit folgendem Problem umgehen sollen: „Mein Mann arbeitet 40 Stunden und ist der Meinung, dass er sich deswegen sich nicht an Haushalt und Kinderfürsorge beteiligen muss. Es sei meine Aufgabe, schließlich muss ich nicht arbeiten gehen.“ Kurze Antwort: Bild
Lange Antwort: dasnuf.de",notallmen,"|Ist das wohl nicht so? 😂|Witzig, das, was viele Männer ""arbeiten"" nennen, ist ja in Wirklichkeit 40 Stunden sitzen und in Ruhe Kaffee trinken. Und alleine aufs Klo gehen! Härlisch😍 (ja, ich weiß, dass Arbeiten auch anstrengend ist. Und stressig sein kann. Und dass nicht jeder den ganzen Tag rumsitzt! 😉)|4 mal nachts aufstehen à 45 Minuten? Das ist dann aber schon sehr sehr extrem. Mein Stillbaby war immer 2 x 5-10 Minuten zum Trinken wach. Windeln hat der Papa gewechselt. Ich glaube es ist gut, wenn man von Anfang an klar macht, dass man das nicht alleine schafft. Männer müssen aber noch lernen, beruflich kürzer zu treten (sehe ich gerade an meinem Bruder) und Frauen, dass das vom Mann verdiente Geld nicht alles ist (sehe ich gerade an meiner Schwester). Ich bin sehr für gerecht aufteilen. Aber dafür müssen beide kämpfen, an verschiedenen Fronten 😀|Allein, dass ein Geschwister keinen vollen Fremd-Betreuungsumfang mehr in Anspruch nehmen darf, wenn die Mutter in Elternzeit ist. Ich kann gar nicht so viel kotzen wie es ungerecht und diskriminierend und scheiße ist, einer Mutter zu unterstellen, sie hätte mit Baby und weiterem/n Kind/ern nicht so viel zu tun wie jemand, der 20h in der Woche arbeitet. Und wie arschlos es für das Geschwister es dann ist, auf Zeit und Freunde zu verzichten, wenn es denn gern in die Fremdbetreuung geht. Ich wiederhole mich: wann hört es auf, dass das so gemein ist? 
Und dabei empfinde ich Kinder begleiten noch nicht einmal als Arbeit. Und dennoch... 😤|Sehr interessanter Artikel. Habe ich mal wortlos an den Partner weitergeleitet, auch wenn es nach 10 Jahren Reibereien besser wird. Ein Glück, daß es auch lernfähige Männer gibt.|Drei Dinge, die SEHR gut sind:

Bin sogar fest davon überzeugt, dass meine Mutter genau aus diesen Gründen heute nicht mehr lebt #dorfleben Anyway, ich mache es anders und würde gerne wissen, wie Männer für das Thema erreicht werden? Meine Gender-Professorin sagte immer „liebe Frauen, ihr habt es selber in der Hand, lasst die Beine zu, ihr sitzt am längeren Hebel.“ - Gemma Hartley schreibt ja auch, dass es die kulturelle und gesellschaftlich patriarchale Prägung/Erziehung ist, die Männer und Frauen so denken und handeln lassen. Männern ist dieses Problem ja gar nicht offensichtlich und scheinbar sind sie auch gar nicht empfänglich dafür! Wo also ansetzen? Im Geburtsvorbereitungs-Kurs? In der Schule im Sexualkundeunterricht? In der Jungen-Bildung? #mentalload findet in meiner Filterblase nur unter den Frauen statt (mit Ausnahme von ein paar Männern).

Oh! Was it offensive? 
Okay. Before I begin I just want to make it clear that I don't agree with #allmenaredogs .

Don't worry I'm not going to talk about *ghar mein papa or bhai nhi hain kya?* .

But before I begin I want to know why are you searching for the explanation to this in the caption? .

If your man ditched you, don't address him as “All men”. Address him by his name eg. ABC is a dog. Leave innocent men out of your bad experience. .

If you are having problems with your man please don't make every lady think all men are dog like him. Quietly take your dog to the veterinary for review. . “All men are dogs”, should be like :
“All men I choose are dogs”.
Let's be honest, ladies.
.

And and and the most important part, who the hell asked you to compare bad men with dogs? Dogs are so cute, so loyal, so nice.

Find better adjectives/nouns to abuse, my girls :p. .

I went on a date like 2 weeks ago with somebody who was super cool, he spoke four languages and has a degree in neurobiology and works in data science, with a focus on AI. 6'4 and handsome. His Instagram was full of pictures of him at the gym, but he wasn't one of those cocky guys, he only had about 30 followers. Born in Egypt, spiritual. On our second date, I took him to go pick some datura, and we had walked alone up to a far dark corner of an empty University campus here in Seattle Washington. It was past midnight, pitch black out, and we smoked some pot. that was when he told me he had a confession to make. My hands felt so clammy when he said it. Needless to say, his confession was chilling as he told me that he had recently been released from prison for sexual assault of a minor. I was shaking! I immediately left. When I Google searched his name, it was all over the news, I felt like such a fool for not investigating him further before I went out on a date with him. we had such a connection, he was a Gemini Moon just like me and I had met him at an art walk in a public area and he was very charming, I take it he was just a predator in disguise and I fell for his trap. I feel so unnerved! It was the first date I've gone on in years after I left my former abuser, and a friend had talked me into it saying that I was worrying over nothing and that this guy was really great. I was telling him how I felt uncomfortable hanging out with somebody I didn't really know, and he told me just to go with the flow and that I was potentially missing out on a great guy because of my fears. I don't know why I didn't get his information the night that we had first met, but luckily we only hung out twice before he confessed. I felt like a dick head asking him for his last name the first night we met, I didn't get it until our second date. but it's still chilling because those first nights we hung out, I had no idea what he had done. I just can't stop thinking about it..i was alone in his car and we were having so much fun talking about taking mushrooms and going to this petrified Forest and doing a ritual. I just don't get it.|One of the great things about being an “older” woman is that I no longer have to deal with all the shit from dumb-ass men. Some women claim they feel invisible at my age, but I love it. The clowns could care less about me. I remember being pregnant and men stopped chasing me, and it was a HUGE relief. I felt unmasked. Like I could move comfortably about the world again. So my heart goes out to you young women who live in a universe that hasn’t changed. I know it hasn’t changed because Lucy and Edie (13 and 14) and their friends deal with it already.

I’m read as female by most people in society right? If somebody calls me “ma’am” that would be correct but the person calling me that doesn’t know that I have xx chromosomes I could be trans for all they know because that’s not how gender works chromosomes were found in 1905 and gender has been a construct for thousands of years that’s why this discussion seems kinda useless to me because the majority of people don’t know their chromosomes also not to mention intersex people who are completely left out of this discussion|there is only 2 genders|but trans people don't choose|i am trans & don't regret coming out|just respect trans peoples pronouns and they will respect you|Bruh are u fucking w me yeah there’s only two sexes but if a mans feels like a fucking chick let him how do it affect u|theres only 2 genders|And it still is, however gender dysphoria is a real thing.

185,185,"Dear Dean,

Hello.
I just wanted to let you know that I recently read some of the love letters you wrote to my mother while she was in college.
From what I'd heard about you, I had imagined you to be this super cool, smart guy.
A real catch.
Turns out you were a real dick.
(Good call on my mother's part for dumping your cheating ass). 30 years later you two reconnected and started corresponding again.
I read some of those letters, too.
Turns out you spent those 30 years becoming an even bigger dick.
Like, HUGE 😱

I'm saving the original letters from college, purely for the aesthetics. The others have been put in the recycling bin.

Best regards,
Nancy

p.s. - the toy Porsche you gave her back in 1961 is kinda cool.
I'm keeping it.

Miren todo lo que hacemos laas madres en soledad incluso con un tipo al lado.

La razón por la que los hombres no construyen una etica de la afectividad es porque siempre han ejercido el monopolio de la violencia. Pero hay que cambiar, se hace urgente.

This creature, whom you are free to proactively block, won’t take no for an answer.

Repeated nos from me mean to him that I have a problem.

Let that sink in.

Me NOT accepting his unwanted attention is problematic.

And when I tell him on my terms that I am not happy with his harrassment, there is indignation on his end.

THIS is why I am adopting a zero tolerance policy. 
People who think they can force their attention on me are the scum of the earth and will be dealt with as such.

Remember this, if a person does not know how to understand and accept your discontent, they CANNOT be trusted.

Think about that the next time you allow inane comments on your posts because you think it is flattering and they are harmless.

197,197,"I read somewhere ""Men and women are equal"", I've heard it as well so many times. But is it true? We keep hearing about the problems women go through but does anyone talk about what men go through? They go through so much just as we women. Because of the male dominant society, it's on their shoulders to provide for the family. It's on them to protect the women in the house. They have to make sure wherever the women work they are safe. They have to be a very good dad and keep their kids safe. They completely are stood down outside because of women who take advantage of being a women. They are most of the time misjudged and are violently treated because of some touching that accidentally happened. You all have heard ""Not all men are same."" But how many of you actually believe it? I do. And I ask you to believe it as well that not all men are same. Some are shitty men but some are angelic.

202,202,"I am now going to take a slightly different route for part deux of my essay on female sexuality in film, certainly a more mainstream view at least. High school comedies always offer a rose-tinted view on romance and relationships, and the high school experience in general, and it is a universally loved genre. However, often the portrayal of females and their sexual journey is prohibited, glamourised and also seen as a goal for their male counterparts... a problematic look for sure.
.
Easy A is a homage to high school comedies of the 80s but it also addresses these problematic views on the female characters. I absolutely adore this film for the way it sheds a light on how modernity affects the way we see women, but how this effect has not necessarily been positive. It has simply opened the doors for heightened misogyny and gives men – and other women might I add (those bitches) – more ammunition against the more free-spirited and liberal women of today, which is wholly unjustified.
.
Emma Stone's character, Olive, is an extremely intelligent and “woke"" young woman, with liberal parents (who, for the record, are probably some of the best movie parents IN THE WORLD). She is the definition of a modern woman, and despite being a virgin and fairly unknown to the boys at her school, has a very progressive and modern view on sex. She is smart enough to know how to work the people around her, to create this baffling self-fulfilling prophecy, because she is aware of the “accelerated velocity of terminological inexactitude"" aka that lies travel fast, and especially ones about women. People just LOVE to gossip about women and their sexual escapades. Lord fucking knows why, but it is just how it is, and people are fucking dumb! (Continued below...)",notallmen,"|(1) This film shows how scummy men can be (#notallmen) and the lengths they will go to put down women to one-up themselves for doing the exact same bloody thing. It reaffirms the bizarre double standards I highlighted in my last essay. Olive is known as a “slut"" and a “tramp"" but the boys get lauded by their friends. They treat her like a prostitute and say they are not obliged to get her permission to further her lie and make up stories about her. These “lies"", where what they point to is incredibly obvious in the film, is in itself a metaphor for sex and how a woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body, but men should not use that as an open door to get what they want without consent. This film is all about consent, people, and how fucking important it is.|(2) This film, on this basis, is so ahead of its time and deserves to be revisited in this post-#metoo world. Where this film may seem to trivialise the matter for the purposes of comedic entertainment, its message is still there. Consent is the basis of all sex. People can do whatever the fuck they want if they give and have consent to do so, and that is no one else's problem. Without it some still take what they want and this, shamefully, is still an issue, and a huge issue for women who are liberal with their sex lives and it is not fair. Consent needs to be taught at a higher standard from a younger age, double standards completely abolished and introduce the apparently insane idea that if it does not affect you then let people get on with whatever the hell they want.
The most important message in this film though, is that, despite the stories that have gone round, despite what people may believe about her, despite what she has consented to, despite what she has or has not done with her body and her sex life, it is nobody's goddamn business.

1.
His name is Worm.
His owner tells me
I'll understand
Once I see him slither.
She says he must not know
What a hiss means.
He runs away from me,
Leaves every room I enter.
Slowly, things change.
He stays on the bed
After I crawl into it. 
He smells my hand
But runs from it.
I tell him I understand
As he hisses at me
While I fill his bowl.
And I do.
One night, I catch him
On top of the couch 
At 2 am, looking defeated 
I reach out. He doesn't run.
It's the first time I touch his fur.
His neck is tense, eyes sad.
I tell him it's okay.
I don't tell him
I won't hurt him.
I don't control his pain.
After I stop,
He looks relieved
And desperate for more.
I tell him I understand.
And I do. 
Worm is a caterpillar,
Afraid of the cocoon 
After some excited child
Trapped him in a glass jar.
His tail is broken in half.
I tell him I don't know 
How to feel safe either.
I slither back into bed,
Hoping he'll follow me.
He doesn't.
I tell him I understand.
And I do.

2.
He jumps out of bed
To avoid me.
I follow him.
I get on my knees.
I say,
""I'm not who hurt you.""
His mouth is open
Mid hiss, he goes silent,
Pierces me with his stare.
I say,
""I'm not the one who hurt you,
But you can't forget.""
He blinks,
Closes his mouth.
His eyes are beautiful
And intense and sad.
I say,
""I can't forget either.""
He walks away
When I start crying.
My forehead 
Touches the floor.
We can't hold each other.
We are alone
In the nightmare worlds
We carry around,
Full of past.
Full of fear.

3.
His owner tells me
He hisses less now.
I send her a list of tips.
Do not give him food
Immediately after
He hisses, wait
Ten seconds or
Until he meows.
Give bits of food
While touching him
To pair safety with
Human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And I wonder if
I should make a list
For future lovers.
Do not hold me
Immediately after
I pull away, wait
A few minutes or
Until I say, “I’m scared.”
Give compliments
While touching me
To pair safety
With human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And if you are not ready
To love a creature
Who cannot forget,
Do not take me into
The warmth of your arms.
You will only make it worse.",notallmen,"|#vironikatugaleva #notallmen #yesallwomen #metoo #metoomovement #ptsd #trauma #traumapoetry #poetry #poet #writer #writing #instapoet #poemsofinstagram #poemsporn #wordswithqueens #poemsoftheday #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #mentalhealthquotes #realconvo #poetrysociety #poem #poetsofig #poetsofinstagram #abuse #survivorpoem #abusesurvivor #spilledink #poetryheals|Well, you succeeded in making me cry.

There’s a reason I’ve only been to the doctors once in the last 4 years, and it’s not because I’ve got perfect health.
I’m just deeply fed up of being told that my sciatica, my throat infection or my earache is caused by my fatness.
I wish doctors treated the reason I was there for instead of trying to cure my horrible case of being a fat fuck. Because then maybe I wouldn’t be a 26 year old with chronic back pain.

After that she was asking if i have problems with my mental health, i told i do and she added ""oh do you have a husband?"", I said ""yes"" and she replied ""how did you find him being so nervous"". What the fuck? If i have problems with mental health does it mean i am not loveable or I can't find a man?! So stupid. I left her and found another doctor which also mentioned my weight but in a different way which was accepted by me. The second doctor knew i have polycystic ovarian syndrome which gives you some struggles with losing weight and she said ""i know it is hard for you to lose weight with this hormonal problems and i know you lose hair because you have depression, i can see that in your eyes"". I know can see how empathy catches our souls, even if we have a problem we deserve love and acceptance not ignorance from people.|My doctor in Australia called me in after having work required tests. He wanted to tell me I was fat, I was sooooo surprised because I didn’t know( having never looked in a mirror, tried to buy clothes etc.) he offered me appetite suppressants, which I told him wouldn’t work, I sometimes eat because I (shock and horror) enjoy food not just because I am hungry! He offered me therapy to ‘fix that problem’ which I politely declined because who wants to stop enjoying what they eat!!!! I then had to pay for being spoken to like an idiot. What an utter waste of time and money and I didn’t get to go on the work trip because I was considered too fat to go up a mountain - propensity to get altitude sickness is absolutely unrelated to weight (says so in the medical texts!) I will not be upset because I am furious.|I have a sweet nurse practitioner I go to for most of my issues and she’s such a sweetheart 😍I aspire to be her one day! Where she tells me what’s up without blaming my weight.. like she’s seen my weight fluctuates so she knows my struggle|I haven’t been to my general doctor in 3 years (need to switch I guess) because my first time seeing her she set up an appointment for me to see a nutritionist. Which I canceled. My gyno has asked me to go in the South Beach diet.  I found an online doctor to buy birth control from so I probably won’t go to the gyno anymore either. I’m tired of them making me feel awful for what I look like. Which I know is irrational considering I could be risking my own health in the process.|I went to see a doctor about my ezcema , he wanted to weigh me straight away!! What's my weight gotta do with my skin?!!|Last time I went to the doctors to get more BC pills prescribed he was like:Have you been exercising? I've been going to the gym for about 2 months at that point trying to get my shit together so I'm like yeah,I've lost like 8 kgs as well. And he's like ""Okay keep doing that"" I'm sorry but...fuck you?🙄|I wasnt diagnosed with PCOS until it was close to being too late because they thought i was just fat and eating too many greasy foods ans thats why my lower abdomen hurt when it was really just cysts popping :)|I find this subject quite confusing. As a health professional I wouldn't UNNECESSARILY bring up a person's health. However; if a person comes to me because they have breathing difficulties, back pain, joint problems, etc I'd have to explore the possibility that their weight may be a factor in exacerbating this. They've come to me because they have a problem and quite often pills/treatment isn't the answer and I have to be honest. I'm not being fattist - I want to help, but sometimes weight loss is part of the answer.|Just went to see nurse, worried I have yet another infection in my throat. Instead taking any bloodwork or examing me, I got a lecture of how I should stop eating chocolate and red wine, since they can irritate my stomach which causes my throat to get irritated. 1. I also have terrible cough and runny nouse and slight fever, like everyone else in my family, but must be my tummy and 2. I don't eat chocolate or drink red wine ever, but thanks for assuming ❤️ 😂|i hope this doesn‘t come across the wrong way, but does this really happen? it‘s very upsetting. i‘m fairly aware of my „thin privilege“, but to think that health care is so influenced by weight stigma is horrible. i‘m not saying it‘s not true, just wondering how on earth professional doctors could act like this. this is not ok.|OMG YES.|This. It’s exhausting and so prevalent. I’m currently feuding with a doctor who legitimately lied to me about the causes of an disorder so she could pressure me to lose weight. Apparently uterine prolapse is ONLY related to weight, and not my long history of pelvic surgeries and frequent bouts of constipation.  At least according to my ex-doctor. 🤨😡🙄|My chronic back pain actually got a little better as I got fatter. Go figure.|I injured my knee at work when I slipped on ice and my doctor kept telling me to lose weight instead of saying I needed to work on strengthening my knee. My weight didn’t hurt my knee, the work injury did.|Part Holistic part regular healthcare is the way to go. My therapist & my doctor are both trained holistically & in medical school|When I was anorexic and lost 1/5 my body weight in a few months, I went to my gyno for my yearly checkup and his comment on my weight was, “See, birth control doesn’t make you fat! Good job!” 🤬🤬🤬|I get this all the time ffs!!!|I fractured my ankle once a few years back due to the roads being crap and, stepping into a pothole at night. It was my fat that broke my ankle. Not the gaping hole in the ground when I stepped off the side walk. Just my fat. 🙄|I didn’t see a doctor in 8 years until around a year ago, partly because of the same fear, and partly because I have it in my head I don’t need/deserve help. Fortunately every one that I’ve seen since has been wonderful and I’ve only had one doctor even mention my weight and that was in passing (and a perfectly valid suggestion for what I was in for), certainly not the only thing they focussed on. 
I don’t believe in weighing myself, but I am trying to be more conscious of what I do eat just because I have very little appetite these days.|@charlotte_susannee LOOK OUT WORLD, THE NEW WAVE OF DOCTORS IS COMING 💪🏼👩🏼‍⚕️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|I’ve been big since I was a child, and my pediatrician was always so unfriendly and mean about me needing to lose weight. I would go to the doctors with such anxiety, that once I was old enough, I stopped going to them all together (other then my lady doctor). I’m too afraid, and it’s sad. I feel better I’m not alone in this, but it is still so sad so many of us have these experiences! We are more than our fatness, we’re PEOPLE.|I have to say I’m known for being feisty so my drs don’t mention it but I have experienced it in the past. I’m sure it must come up in red on screen. Erm no I have tonsiltus nothing to do with weight!!! 🤦🏼‍♀️|This|I nearly died from a blood clot in my lungs bcz all the doctor saw was my weight. Fuck him|Terrified to go to the doctor now because since I was 13 everything has been about weight.|💯💯💯💯💯💯|I lost weight and it still done nothing for my back! Actually, I ended up in hospital for a week unable to walk when I was at my smallest! It was the worst I'd ever been! Now I've put a bit of weight back on again I've actually seen an improvement in how often my back plays up 🤷🏻‍♀️|I feel this so much. I was in a bad car accident several years ago that I fractured my lower spine and the right side of my pelvis in. I went through physical therapy, but as the years went by, my legs got weaker and there was no clear explanation. I thought it was nerve damage, so I brought it up to my doctor, and his answer was to lose weight. So, I started working out like a maniac. I lifted weights that were too heavy and tried body weight exercises that were too much. I constantly had sprained joints and pulled muscles. Then I moved to a new state and started seeing a new general doctor, so I brought it up to him. Same thing. Just lose weight. So, I continued hurting myself. Until I had enough and found a doctor that would listen to me. She referred me to a neurologist that specializes in nerve and muscle diseases. That neurologist took one look at the way I walked and said ""i'm not trying to scare you, but something is definitely wrong with your muscles"". I cried, but they were tears of joy. Somebody finally listened to me! He ran a bunch of tests, and i'm awaiting the final diagnosis, but i'm so close. I'm so close to healing and living the life I want. I want to walk up stairs without dragging my legs, walk by dog without fear of her pulling me down if she sees a squirrel,  and to not have to scope out places to make sure I don't have to step up a curb to get to it. Keep trying. Keep complaining. Don't shut up and don't take no for an answer. Get a second, third, and even a fourth opinion. Find a doctor that listens to you. They are out there, I promise. I may be speaking from a place of privilege because I have good health insurance, but I hope this can be a reality for everyone someday.|But you are fat (very sexy but still fat). And it would undeniably be healthier to diet and exercise a bit, rather than justify your fatness with body positivity. And it would probably help with your back pain too if you wouldn't lugging around all that belly blubber. (But I must admit, the belly blubber is pretty dang attractive on you.)|Aint that the truth! 😢|🙌 PREACH! 👏|When I was laid up in the ER with a ruptured and disc actively leaking fluid onto and putting pressure onto my spinal cord so that I couldn't walk, I had a female Dr literally smack my ass and tell me ""Well if you'd like a little bit of THIS"" your back wouldn't hurt so much. I had injured it working in my garden though, from twisting, and I had my thyroid taken out due to cancer AND was insulin resistant and wasn't even an overeater. I felt so terribly small and misunderstood and insulted all at the same time.|Same. 👏|Funny how my sciatica went away when they actually operated on the disk and nerve that were the problem and fluctuations in weight over the 2-3 years I had the problem made fuck all difference|Doctors also just don't know what to do with sciatica 🤭 we just use acupuncture these days and skip the $80 Google search|I am overweight and a soon-to be doctor in italy. I was doing practise in the obesity centre of my town college hospital, when all of a sudden the director of this ward comes to me telling me that I should lose weight because I'm not a good example for the people of that centre. What? When I applied for that place the director saw me ( so she saw the I am overweight) and agreed to make me practise there, now I'm too fat to be a doctor?|amen 👏👏👏 I don't go doctors because I know my fat will always come up as a reason haha.|I went to the doctors chronically depressed, he asked to weigh me whilst I was there. I refused, stating that I know I am fat and actually getting on the scales would probably tip me over the edge at that moment in time. I changed my doctor!|I was told my tonsil grew back less than a month after being removed because I was too fat. Wtf.|They don't listen to women either, since our pain is probably minimal and we're hysterical and whatnot. I'm glad I have a doctor (actually a physician's assistant, but who's counting?) whom I feel comfortable opening up to and who listens instead of judging. It's hard to find a doctor you really like, but like a pair of pants, keep trying until you find the right fit. ❤️|😔 (Saw you at the Birmingham show last night and you are an absolute delight! As performers you and Megan compliment each other so well!)|This needs to change, what if you actually are sick and it has zilch to do with your weight?|Check out @drnadolsky 💕 Maybe there’s hope in the current healthcare culture.

212,212,"Paris. The scene of the crime. You never fail to leave me used. On a pedestal and reduced to my flesh. I didn’t know how to write this so I’ll cut to the end. Some man spiked my drink.
.
I went there to be an artist. For the first time. To read poetry. It’s been two weeks since and I’m starting at the end and editing the rhyme because it’s a grubby business that doesn’t deserve art. Premeditated rape. It’s thrown me but let’s step back.
.
I did read poetry. It was beautiful. It was about the Captain. A love ditty called Find a Man and I heard the room sigh and sigh and a woman asked at the end “where do I find a man like that?” and I said “at home”. And...then, how I wanted to be home. But the game was set and there was red wine to drink and a park bench at the bar and “not all men” so I sat. And like a nice girl. A fun girl. I chatted to the barman and the other guy.
.
Statement of fact: he was 6ft. Fit build. Long dreads. Hat. Of African descent and spoke English with a self assured manner that made it impossible for two weeks to think he’d need to drug a girl to get laid. I’m a strong independent woman so I told him I wasn’t looking for anything. To chase tail elsewhere but he insisted on chatting. Before you ask, I bought my own drinks.
.
It hit that point. You know that point where the room heats up and you can’t breathe? Women know. It comes from nowhere. I made an excuse to leave. He said he’d walk me. There was no need but I’d assessed the street. It was lit and busy. Even in that state I knew I was alone in the city. It hadn’t quite registered that he knew I was too.
.
My sandals kept slipping. Now I remember slurring. I never slur but I asked him if my hotel was close. He looked at the map on my phone. “That’s not far away. I’ll walk you”.
.
We walked 100 metres. I processed it with every step. How it took me 20 minutes in a cab. How he asked if I was with those people. How I’d paid 15 euro for my drinks and how even in France that’s not enough red wine for my Polish blood.
.
I told him I was calling a cab. He turned and left.
.
Paris. I always avoid the crime but you avoid the punishment.
.
I’m home. Safe. I’m still unravelling this tomorrow. ❤️",notallmen,"|WOW! Perfect shot! We are looking MAZZOTTI family members like you.

214,214,"I’m getting tired of only hearing people talk about empowering girls and women.

Body image issues, mental health problems, pressure to always be perfect and control our emotions, isolation and finding a sense of community with similar people- all of these things are talked about as young women’s issues (and sometimes lgbtq+ people’s) in feminist communities, when they really affect ALL young people today, including young men.

The thing is, for both cultural and biological reasons, women tend be more communal than men- so as women we’ve created so many safe spaces FOR women (and lgbtq+ people to a large degree), but men, especially young men who need support just like young women do, get left out of these spaces and conversations and don’t get the same kind of community-based support and knowledge that the rest of us do online.

Yes, there are issues that women and trans people face that many men will never even have to think about- BUT this is becoming less and less true as time goes on, and particularly for Gen Z, guys don’t have as much privilege over others as they do in older generations, AND the greatest issues affecting humanity now are things that EVERYONE needs to care about and everyone needs to learn about.

I realize that many women-only spaces exist because many women are more comfortable and feel like they have a voice with other women- these spaces should still exist for the purpose of providing community, friendships, and support.

But when it comes to spaces that are focused on advocacy and education- the target audiences can’t only be half the population. Leaving men out of spaces that focus on feelings that everyone has and societal issues that everyone has a role in, perpetuates the idea that men and women are very distinct and require different knowledge about the world. If we want everyone at every level of privilege and identity to be aware of the problems that others face, then we need to share that information with EVERYONE.",notallmen,|#feminism #feminist #women #bodypositive #mentalhealth #equality #equity #intersectionalfeminism #womensrights #selfcare #toxicmasculinity #womenempowerment #notallmen (lol) #girlpower #smashthepatriarchy #patriarchy #toronto #torontoblogger #canada|Great post.|I love you ♥️|🔥👏🏼|Looking good!

232,232,"[LAUGH] “All things are both simultaneously deeply sacred and not sacred at all, and we must be careful about how much and what kind of meaning we attach to anything.” I am so ridiculously grateful for this mornings pull from #theknowingdeck by @cielgrove. This past week I have had these really weird experiences with social media that started to pull at my joy in life. 
This week I shared an article called “5 jeans that will find your clitoris faster than Brian”. A humorous and satirical post that highlights 5 brands that fully give you a frontal wedgie. I found this hilarious because having owned 2 pairs featured- it was absolutely true and my clit was still undecided if she actually liked it or not. 🧐

Brian, whoever he may be- was the butt of the joke. Claiming he’d be busy rubbing your belly button while your new Levi’s would hit your clitoris spot on. This set of several private messages and threads about how this article shamed mens sexual knowledge and women’s lack of communication. It was pointed out how it was only further prolonging the problem.

True. Absolutely. True. What’s also true is that it wasn’t a well written article. With no intention of shifting the sexual paradigm that presently exists. Ironically- the distaste for the article only came from women claiming that the article was hateful to men alike, while men laughed at the absurdity. 
There was a moment where I asked myself “why don’t I feel apologetic after they holding me accountable for sharing a ‘damaging’ article?” It was painful because I felt so separate from these women and the apology. “Sorry” felt inauthentic and a straight up lie for me to say, but I didn’t want them to hate me for not saying it. So I tossed back at forth from about what to do.

This mornings pull reminded me why I chose to let it be and not say the untrue. 
To me the article was a joke. A joke trying to sell women’s jeans. And yes maybe a joke that nods to “bro-culture”, where “Brian” is someone who never receives sexual adjustments from women. (Ahem. #notallmen - if you will)  Much like “Becky” is a nod to clueless white women and “Felicia” is someone to dismiss. 
CONTINUED IN COMMENTS",notallmen,"|But from what I’ve experienced being dogmatic doesn’t actually shift reality. None of us can lay down any principle as incontrovertibly true on another person. I have never changed my behaviour after being scorned. So recognizing that morals, ethics, and virtues vary from each person- what can we do? I believe that we’re better off laughing then personally taking actions that INSPIRE others into making the world a better place. 
So I laugh at the fact that I was in turmoil over how to apologize for an article about clitoris rubbing denim. I laugh at how I almost spun out and beat myself up for not ‘doing my part’. I laugh that in reality I am actively coaching women on how to communicate in the moment about their truest sexual desire, and set men to show up as absolute geniuses in their lives. I also laugh that I actively am training men to lay off he goal and performance mindset and drop into to connection. 
I am not here to “protect” - you don’t need it. I am also not here to make anyone small. I am here to support both men and women have deeper connection and intimacy. It just so happens that my work actually starts with a CLITORIS. 
I love using levity as a way to move forward past shit, especially when life is constantly grounding and heavy. My clients love it too. So let this be my plea and commitment to not lose the humour our journeys. 
You’ve only got 80 years left.",25

234,234,"With projects like 'Vicky Donor', 'Andhadhun', 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan' and lots more, Ayushmann has always proven to be an actor who is not afraid to go the extra mile in service of the script. Be it being blind, playing an asshole, taking up taboo roles like a sperm donor or even emasculating himself, he has always made choices no other commercial actor would make. But then he does a 'Dream Girl' that's not particularly nuanced or woke.

This ""not-so-self-aware"" comedy is like a whiny step sibling to 'Vicky Donor', where the sperm donation is replaced by a phone sex call center, which creates all kinds of ruckus in our protagonist's life. To make things clearer, Anu Kapoor is also here, playing an important part in the protagonist's life. There is no problem in following the success formula of what makes an ""Ayushmann Khurrana film"", even 'Badhaai Ho' did that to some extent but proved to be one of the best comedies in Bollywood. What 'Dream Girl' forgets is, sharp one-liners and interesting characters just aren't enough for a compelling dramedy. Director Raaj Shaandilyaa never plays around with the set-up and keeps his story at face value. There was potential for hilarious twists and turns if the characters were developed well. The trailers had even spoiled some of the more interesting plot lines. To make things worse, there's a lesbian feminist caricature who is just present to be mansplained in the end that, #notallmen. It's no big issue just for that though, we've had plenty of films doing it since forever. What's disappointing is getting this from an Ayushmann Khurrana film, there is zero amount of subtlety and nuance in any given scene. Everything and everyone is a caricature. To give credit where it's due, the silly gags and ""pooja/karam"" puns often times work and make for a fairly entertaining time at the theatre. 'Dream Girl' is painfully average as a social satire but works well as a 2 hour episode of that obnoxious Kapil Sharma show. People who are fine with casual sexism and homophobia might consider this the best comedy of 2019, or else I would recommend to do a Ayushmann Khurrana film marathon at home. ⭐⭐1/2",notallmen,|Agree 100%|Aaji jaithilu?,51

247,247,"We’re all here on Earth together. Affirming the obvious because we seem to forget. We’re divided as a nation, in a deep state of mourning and longing for peace and healing. We’ve lost our way because far too many have grown up with skewed perceptions of strength, gender archetypes, what 
acceptance means, and that women exist merely for their own objectification and satisfaction. The narrative of an unconscious nation unfolds before us. The stories that are being brought to light are only few of the countless untold stories of the rape culture that has permeated our society, that every woman has been a victim in some form or another and will be able to recall in gut-wrenchingly vivid detail if you only ask. The #aminext movement has sparked the awareness that we all desperately needed about gender based violence and we can only hope that things will begin to change with men and their understanding of consent, oppressive language and what constitutes a violation. But for now, as women, we are more alert than ever before. The perpetrators out there haven't stopped because they’ve read a post on social media or saw footage of our president addressing us outside Parliament last week and suddenly decided that what they were doing was wrong. Since last Thursday, numerous other femicides have been reported. Know that there are more that have gone unnoticed or unreported. Any one of us could truly be next. We’re conscious of who’s around us at all times, if we’re being followed or gawked at or receive an unsolicited “Mmm hey sexy” walking down the street minding our own business. We scrutinize our Uber driver’s profiles. We have security apps downloaded, open and ready if we feel threatened. We second guess our clothing choices in fear of being eyeballed (as much as we hate having to do this) because it really could mean the difference between life or death when you’re dealing with entitled men. This is the reality that we face every day. We live in a perpetual state of fear. [Continued in comments...]",notallmen,"|So if you’re seriously still perplexed by #menaretrash and are echoing the #notallmen defence, consider how you’d feel if you had to live like this, unable to distinguish the good from the bad. Recognize that you are an intrinsic part of the solution, guilty or not. We need your voices - desperately. Don’t move forward after reading this and every other post about GBV like everything’s normal. Don’t shake your head at other men and then keep going about your day. If you’re not actively engaging in uncomfortable conversations, shutting down sexist banter and standing with us in our battle for liberation from all forms of male oppression, you’re complicit in your inaction. Feminism is a movement inherently rooted in inclusivity and we urgently need everyone to recognize this as we navigate our way through damaged socio-political times. August has traditionally been a month of celebration of women but the truth is we have nothing to celebrate right now based on the way that women have suffered at the hands of men over the last few weeks. If anything, we celebrate in the little privilege we have as women if we don’t have further odds stacked against us. Feminism has been fighting typical binary gender stereotypes, bodily autonomy, and the patriarchy forever but POC, LGBTQ+ people and non-conforming genders are further discriminated against in the midst of the femicide epidemic sweeping through South Africa. So while you count your blessings if you fall under a privileged demographic, acknowledge that there are greater battles out there being fought and do what you can to use your platform and stand in support of those further oppressed in our collective plight for sheer survival.

252,252,"Why do white men take my precautions for safety as an insult to their nation?

I don’t stand near the street or train tracks in fear of someone pushing me into the oncoming traffic or a train. I seldom walk in the dark alone in fear of someone following me with bad intentions. Luckily for me, I haven’t experienced anything more severe than racial slurs and occasional followings so far, but you never know how those things can elevate into something more fatal. When I express my fears and experiences, my female and LGBTQ friends empathize. However, white men take it as an insult to their nation. And they aspire to “enlighten” me, saying (in this case) Finland is a safe country.

Whatever issue I bring up as racism, they deflate it as quickly as possible to a personal problem. It is “that” person who is the problem. Finland is a good country. But their white abled bodies don’t get malicious, unflinching stares on the street. They are not the one who gets yelled at by drunks or asked rude questions by strangers, and at the same time, feel helpless because you cannot counterattack. I try to point out that the world I experience is different from what they as white men experience, only to be shushed and shamed.

The problem of white men deflating every societal, racial issue to a personal one is that they’re condoning the idea of white privilege, that what white men don’t experience is not a real problem. I’m the one too sensitive. The thing is that this is not an individual problem. If the society does not permit racially discriminating behavior, there will be far less accounts. So what white men should do instead of trying to shut me up and jump into defense mode is to go shut the racists up.

254,254,"THERE IS NO EXCUSE!
This week three more womens bodies were found, in three separate occurances, in Australia.

Really?...we are STILL finding bodies across this country of women beaten, raped, attacked and murdered.

This week is the 37th week in the year.
37 weeks have happened in 2019.
34 of those weeks represent another woman who's life was ended by the brutality of misogyny and the overflow effects of a patriarchal society which has educated us to believe in gender based entitlement.

34 women THIS YEAR!

Dead.

ITS OT OK AUSTRALIA.

Brothers... Please. Learn to curb your anger, I get it, life can be fucking horrible at times. People can be annoying, frustrating... absurdly attractive and heartbreaking... But NONE of those things are a reason to lash out and kill someone.

This is no longer about us as women.
We were brought up to believe it was. That we were too loud, too slutty, out too late, too drunk, too friendly, too foolish... That this is why we were being treated this way.

But it's not about us.

It's about you.

What are you doing to change yourself? To support yourself emotionaly? Whether or not you consider yourself to be a ""good guy""...whether or not you think #notallmen... Whether or not you believe you would be the ""kind of person"" to do this... It doesn't matter.
Changing a culture begins with changing yourself.

Not sure how you can make change? Here's some ideas: - Get a therapist or mental health plan. We ALL have shit going on deep inside ourselves, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with us. What is wrong, is not creating a life that supports yourself through it. What is wrong is pretending it's not there, not getting to know it intimately and creating a deep and loving understanding of our own inner workings, triggers, defence mechanisms... - Start attending men's spaces which are based on self reflection, radical honesty and intersectional feminism focused respect. Surround yourself with other men who are doing the work and do it together.

Continued in comments... #femicide #feminist #feminism #womensrights #womenspeak #howmanywomen #metoo #murder #bossbabe #queerstories #witchesofinstagram #speakup #strongwomen #yesallmen",notallmen,"|- Educate yourself in communication styles and anger management. (yes women need to do this too, all people of all gender... But right now.. I'm talking to you). Non-violent communication (nvc) is a good start. Anger management and constructive anger release is another. We all have anger. It's how were choose to move through it that is important.
There are SO MANY MORE ways, including voulenteering, advocacy and more. But really the key shift is not what you are DOING but who are you BEING?
Educate, practice, shift and grow. You doing it and being honest about that will inspire other men to do the same. You doing it IS CULTURAL CHANGE.
You doing these things will save lives...
34 lives this year.
34 women.
Think about it.

Dear Society,
This is not an anti-men hate speech, nor is this a cry for help. This is to remind you that even though you continuously say ‘not all men’, unfortunately you’re raising a bunch of entitled men that are threatened & offended by a woman’s choices.

In the last few weeks, the amount of abuse stories I’ve heard, have only gotten more jarring.

I heard from a girl yesterday that was raped by her own friend while they were drinking at his house. He pinned her down & threatened he’d have her disappeared if she said a word to anyone, as he raped her. Her body, covered in bruises. I saw the bruises.

A girl, so close to me, was raped by her own friend, in her sleep.

Another girl, raped by her cousin brother, his friends, & her neighbour - all between the age of 7 & 16.

I got a text from a girl who’s boyfriend ‘occasionally’ beats her black & blue, she wrote to me with tears in her eyes & blood on her face, assuring me that he did love her, he was a good man, he just... had an anger problem. She didn’t know ‘what she should do to help him’. Another girl said her boyfriend won’t wear a condom when he forcefully enters her. When she refuses, he says ‘if you love me, you wouldn’t say no.’ She would prove it... if she doesn’t, then he’ll leave her.

A friend of mine, lives on the ground floor & her neighbour, the girl upstairs, got raped by the electrician while her mother was out buying food. She had told her not to open the door, but he wanted water. Where were her manners, after all?

9 out of 10 women in our country, have been abused at some point in their lives. Read that again.

So this is not an anti-men speech, nor is it a cry for help. It’s a reminder.

Society,
Thanks to the entitled men you’re aggressively raising - women with stories of abuse are finally talking. Not all of them are strong enough to go to the police - but they’re speaking up. They’re  survivors. They’re changing our world.

You’re going to need a new hashtag; #NotAllMen isn’t going to work anymore, because #NotAllWomen are buying the entitled victim complex.

263,263,"Thank you to @miniitalian for giving me the courage to also share my story in the form of a letter. 
To my rapist,

Do you remember that night? I’ll admit, I still can’t recall every little detail. It’s amazing what the human brain is capable of, what it will do to try and retain a smidge of sanity. I spent months attempting to numb myself, to drink away your memory. I wanted to forget so badly.

I couldn’t forget though. Sure my brain originally spared me the harsh details of your depravity, but you can’t keep secrets from yourself, not for long. The rest of the world however; they could never find out. This was, after all, my fault. Wasn’t it?

I wonder what you would say if I told you how I have driven myself mad with self-blame, severe anxiety and panic attacks; that I no longer wanted to live. Would you care? Would you feel remorse? Would you feel anything at all?

The good thing about trauma is that it forces you to make a decision. Up or down, sink or swim, live or die. I knew if I was going to remain on this planet, the band aids I had used to cover my scars would need to be ripped open; the wounds cut deeper with every submission to my memory. I would have to see your face, be back in that room. You taking advantage of me. Wake up with you on top of me. My virginity stolen. 
What still blows my mind is how your best friend, the friend I met you through stayed friends with you even though I told him what you did. The same friend repeatedly invites me to parties where you would be present. The same friend continues to mention your name in front of me, opening up my wounds time after time. 
They say time heals all wounds but I disagree; eventually as time passes you just accept them. You stop trying to hide them. You realize living with scars is better than not living at all.

I decided to believe there is good out there, despite people like you who try to prove otherwise.

And I hope one day you decide to be the good.

Sincerely,
Your victim no more

B) or, promote fitness as one form of self-care whilst trying to popularise the non-physical sides of exercise. In addition to shining a light on Diet Culture and its ability to steal your sunshine and money. Sure, it’s not as sexy... but why does everything have to be sexy anyway?! Oh that’s right, because the large corporations that are dishing out these influencer brand deals are mostly run by men, who only think with their 🍆

It was initially intended to promote solely the message that the hashtag states. Yes there are men in society that are entitled, violent, controlling, manipulative and consequently have no moral standards or regulations as to understanding consent and respect to women. However, the hashtag was initially intended in the same way that the #notallmuslims hashtag was intended. Some men are bought up in the way described above. And some people are bought up amongst the radicalisation of initial Muslim faith. It's the same concept. But yes I agree with your main point here.",27

Whether it’s men choosing to be ignorant by not bothering to be informed, men resorting to immature name calling, men jumping to conclusions rather than reading or men calling on @jordan.b.peterson to rescue them during arguments, I feel no differently because a lion doesn’t concern itself with the opinion of sheep. These types of people either get ignored and shut out or replied to with civility and understanding depending on their attitude and speech, but never in a way stooping down to their level. It certainly doesn’t cease to amuse me, however, that so many men have judged (and will continue to judge) a book by its cover.

275,275,"Since this whole #allmenaretrash bullshit showed up, I've quietly been waiting for the right moment to voice that it's all wrong. Not all men are trash. How many hours have men stayed up advocating for women's rights? How many men have lost their lives protecting women, children and for what? A slap in the face? 
How many sacrifices does a man have to fucking make day in and day out to get even the slightest bit of appreciation? But no... All men are trash... All men are trash because a woman never does anything wrong, right? I mean... Women don't rape... Women don't kill... Women don't lie... Women don't cheat... Women don't steal... No... Every gender has a sinner, every race has a sinner. Would it be polite for me to then turn around and say every German is a Nazi, to say every black person is a thief? To say that every priest is a paedophile, to say that every Islamic person is a terrorist... No. It's not okay. 
I draw this line and if you have a problem with that line, then you need to start looking in the mirror because you are what's wrong with society. Stop compartmentalizing a gender/race based on other motherfuckers disposable acts. And if by the good Lord Himself, you can't see yourself or your gender having ever done anything wrong in the existence of humankind... You are a narrow-minded fool who deserves a place in a cell next to Hitler and the rest of those fools. 
Have a nice day. 
P.S... if you want to have words, go ahead. Just make sure you bring your brain to the table instead of your emotions.

283,283,"Dear Society,
This is not an anti-men hate speech, nor is this a cry for help. This is to remind you that even though you continuously say ‘not all men’, unfortunately you’re raising a bunch of entitled men that are threatened & offended by a woman’s choices.

In the last few weeks, the amount of abuse stories I’ve heard, have only gotten more jarring.

I heard from a girl yesterday that was raped by her own friend while they were drinking at his house. He pinned her down & threatened he’d have her disappeared if she said a word to anyone, as he raped her. Her body, covered in bruises. I saw the bruises.

A girl, so close to me, was raped by her own friend, in her sleep.

Another girl, raped by her cousin brother, his friends, & her neighbour - all between the age of 7 & 16.

I got a text from a girl who’s boyfriend ‘occasionally’ beats her black & blue, she wrote to me with tears in her eyes & blood on her face, assuring me that he did love her, he was a good man, he just... had an anger problem. She didn’t know ‘what she should do to help him’. Another girl said her boyfriend won’t wear a condom when he forcefully enters her. When she refuses, he says ‘if you love me, you wouldn’t say no.’ She would prove it... if she doesn’t, then he’ll leave her.

A friend of mine, lives on the ground floor & her neighbour, the girl upstairs, got raped by the electrician while her mother was out buying food. She had told her not to open the door, but he wanted water. Where were her manners, after all?

9 out of 10 women in our country, have been abused at some point in their lives. Read that again.

So this is not an anti-men speech, nor is it a cry for help. It’s a reminder.

Society,
Thanks to the entitled men you’re aggressively raising - women with stories of abuse are finally talking. Not all of them are strong enough to go to the police - but they’re speaking up. They’re  survivors. They’re changing our world.

You’re going to need a new hashtag; #NotAllMen isn’t going to work anymore, because #NotAllWomen are buying the entitled victim complex.

So I’ll share this very weird phenomenon that people tell girls to ignore. My phone number is out on all websites due to my missing brother’s search. Now, here too I receive 3-4 calls daily that are utter nonsense. One of the fake profiles on Facebook gave out my phone numbers to many men (reported that) 
The men/women I have shared with that this is happening with me , have told me that well this was supposed to happen only you just ignore. 
IGNORE ??!! Ignore 3-4 calls daily asking me “aur kya haal hain” “jaante nhi ho toh jaan jaoge” “gussa Kyun ho rhe ho”. Dude these men are outright crossing the line. They have all being ignored in the past that’s the reason why they are calling a woman who is desperately looking for her missing brother. They have no fucking shame. And The men/women that I admire and are friends with tell me to IGNORE and normalize it. 
Please don’t normalize this behavior. I remember when I was young and I received any random call. My brother would take the phone and yell the crap out of the person calling. Why is it bad if I do that for myself? Why is it overreacting if I report it to the police ?|U proove that u r not only beautiful but also a very intelligent women also many people use instagram to only upload their pics and get more likes and increase their followers but u proove that any one can use social media to rise serious issues and try to know what people think about it so thanks to shift our focus to this very serious issue|I love for this.

Why men.. Why??|@bipolar.blogger it is the case because 9 out of 10 men will laugh away a rape joke. 9 out of 10 men still use adjectives such as 'bitch', 'slut', 'easy', and 'prude'. These are the same men who will raise eyebrows gladly when a girl trips with a drink in her hand. As a woman, who is working and has a social life, why is 2 am chai in front of my house safe for me only with a male friend or with my brother? And if this isn't enough, let's take a look at the number of men who report cases of their friends, brothers, uncles and acquaintances who they know (and usually see) engaging in sexual misdemeanours. That one man out of the ten is usually a person who faces a situation and hence empathises. We generalise because #NotAllWomen are lucky enough to have a support system to voice the things they face.

Just Thank You.|@divyankjain1|Through out various stages of my life I have encountered sexual abuse of sorts. If you are an Indian you must be aware how safe cantonments are, how great and supportive army environment is... My family no matter how supportive doesn't know two of the most jarring experiences of my life. I was groped when i was ten, openly in front of my friends by a man in his mid 20s or early 30s, a dog was barking at us and we were scared, no one saw as it happened. In 8th i was blackmailed by 2 male acquaintances that if I don't become girlfriend of a particular person among the two; they are going to  make a page public on Facebook that has my nudes, I told my parents and police got involved there wasn't any such page, there were no mocked nudes but they had the audacity to do what they did, the guy I mentioned used to stalk me around the school all the time for almost an year even after me telling him off, he stopped after I told my teacher, he did the above mentioned after that. I have been stalked by men from my house till my house, I was in a school van, wearing a typical salwar kurta uniform. every night I take my dog out for a walk with my mom and men slow down their bikes and stare turn and look instead of keeping their eyes on the road. Sometimes I try to tell myself it's my cute pupper they are looking at just so that I don't steam off with anger.  I have been sexually harrassed by my ex-boyfriend. I still don't think every man is the same. I still believe that there are genuinely nice men. Though I have seen very few through out my life, thankfully this guy  @manigill__23  for who he is that I know there are still nice men. This is not for sympathy, or to vent either or to put men down. It is just the truth... Told to make the people who say ""feminism is bullshit"" understand it isn't, to make people understand the reason why women are so fucking angry on the sideline always...! It took me more than a decade to speak about all of this publically even after the supportive and open environment I have grown in. I know stories similar to mine that belong to guys.|So beautiful|Ur too inspiring mam but u don't reply plz rellygg plz💋💋|🔥🔥❤️|❤️❤️❤️|🔥🔥😍😍😍👅|♥️😇|Mam you have raised such  a prevailing issue in our society hats off to you, hope your message rich to million dirty mind guys . 🙌|❤️❤️|You just said everything that has been bubbling in my head❤️|I feel you!",26187

And it’s our job to NOT LOOK AWAY, but ensure they clean up their act and let women feel comfortable anywhere and everywhere.

300,1,"I am now going to take a slightly different route for part deux of my essay on female sexuality in film, certainly a more mainstream view at least. High school comedies always offer a rose-tinted view on romance and relationships, and the high school experience in general, and it is a universally loved genre. However, often the portrayal of females and their sexual journey is prohibited, glamourised and also seen as a goal for their male counterparts... a problematic look for sure.
.
Easy A is a homage to high school comedies of the 80s but it also addresses these problematic views on the female characters. I absolutely adore this film for the way it sheds a light on how modernity affects the way we see women, but how this effect has not necessarily been positive. It has simply opened the doors for heightened misogyny and gives men – and other women might I add (those bitches) – more ammunition against the more free-spirited and liberal women of today, which is wholly unjustified.
.
Emma Stone's character, Olive, is an extremely intelligent and “woke"" young woman, with liberal parents (who, for the record, are probably some of the best movie parents IN THE WORLD). She is the definition of a modern woman, and despite being a virgin and fairly unknown to the boys at her school, has a very progressive and modern view on sex. She is smart enough to know how to work the people around her, to create this baffling self-fulfilling prophecy, because she is aware of the “accelerated velocity of terminological inexactitude"" aka that lies travel fast, and especially ones about women. People just LOVE to gossip about women and their sexual escapades. Lord fucking knows why, but it is just how it is, and people are fucking dumb! (Continued below...)",notallmen,"|(1) This film shows how scummy men can be (#notallmen) and the lengths they will go to put down women to one-up themselves for doing the exact same bloody thing. It reaffirms the bizarre double standards I highlighted in my last essay. Olive is known as a “slut"" and a “tramp"" but the boys get lauded by their friends. They treat her like a prostitute and say they are not obliged to get her permission to further her lie and make up stories about her. These “lies"", where what they point to is incredibly obvious in the film, is in itself a metaphor for sex and how a woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body, but men should not use that as an open door to get what they want without consent. This film is all about consent, people, and how fucking important it is.|(2) This film, on this basis, is so ahead of its time and deserves to be revisited in this post-#metoo world. Where this film may seem to trivialise the matter for the purposes of comedic entertainment, its message is still there. Consent is the basis of all sex. People can do whatever the fuck they want if they give and have consent to do so, and that is no one else's problem. Without it some still take what they want and this, shamefully, is still an issue, and a huge issue for women who are liberal with their sex lives and it is not fair. Consent needs to be taught at a higher standard from a younger age, double standards completely abolished and introduce the apparently insane idea that if it does not affect you then let people get on with whatever the hell they want.
The most important message in this film though, is that, despite the stories that have gone round, despite what people may believe about her, despite what she has consented to, despite what she has or has not done with her body and her sex life, it is nobody's goddamn business.

1.
His name is Worm.
His owner tells me
I'll understand
Once I see him slither.
She says he must not know
What a hiss means.
He runs away from me,
Leaves every room I enter.
Slowly, things change.
He stays on the bed
After I crawl into it. 
He smells my hand
But runs from it.
I tell him I understand
As he hisses at me
While I fill his bowl.
And I do.
One night, I catch him
On top of the couch 
At 2 am, looking defeated 
I reach out. He doesn't run.
It's the first time I touch his fur.
His neck is tense, eyes sad.
I tell him it's okay.
I don't tell him
I won't hurt him.
I don't control his pain.
After I stop,
He looks relieved
And desperate for more.
I tell him I understand.
And I do. 
Worm is a caterpillar,
Afraid of the cocoon 
After some excited child
Trapped him in a glass jar.
His tail is broken in half.
I tell him I don't know 
How to feel safe either.
I slither back into bed,
Hoping he'll follow me.
He doesn't.
I tell him I understand.
And I do.

2.
He jumps out of bed
To avoid me.
I follow him.
I get on my knees.
I say,
""I'm not who hurt you.""
His mouth is open
Mid hiss, he goes silent,
Pierces me with his stare.
I say,
""I'm not the one who hurt you,
But you can't forget.""
He blinks,
Closes his mouth.
His eyes are beautiful
And intense and sad.
I say,
""I can't forget either.""
He walks away
When I start crying.
My forehead 
Touches the floor.
We can't hold each other.
We are alone
In the nightmare worlds
We carry around,
Full of past.
Full of fear.

3.
His owner tells me
He hisses less now.
I send her a list of tips.
Do not give him food
Immediately after
He hisses, wait
Ten seconds or
Until he meows.
Give bits of food
While touching him
To pair safety with
Human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And I wonder if
I should make a list
For future lovers.
Do not hold me
Immediately after
I pull away, wait
A few minutes or
Until I say, “I’m scared.”
Give compliments
While touching me
To pair safety
With human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And if you are not ready
To love a creature
Who cannot forget,
Do not take me into
The warmth of your arms.
You will only make it worse.",notallmen,"|#vironikatugaleva #notallmen #yesallwomen #metoo #metoomovement #ptsd #trauma #traumapoetry #poetry #poet #writer #writing #instapoet #poemsofinstagram #poemsporn #wordswithqueens #poemsoftheday #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #mentalhealthquotes #realconvo #poetrysociety #poem #poetsofig #poetsofinstagram #abuse #survivorpoem #abusesurvivor #spilledink #poetryheals|Well, you succeeded in making me cry.

There’s a reason I’ve only been to the doctors once in the last 4 years, and it’s not because I’ve got perfect health.
I’m just deeply fed up of being told that my sciatica, my throat infection or my earache is caused by my fatness.
I wish doctors treated the reason I was there for instead of trying to cure my horrible case of being a fat fuck. Because then maybe I wouldn’t be a 26 year old with chronic back pain.

I went through physical therapy, but as the years went by, my legs got weaker and there was no clear explanation.

I lifted weights that were too heavy and tried body weight exercises that were too much. I constantly had sprained joints and pulled muscles. Then I moved to a new state and started seeing a new general doctor, so I brought it up to him. Same thing. Just lose weight. So, I continued hurting myself. Until I had enough and found a doctor that would listen to me. She referred me to a neurologist that specializes in nerve and muscle diseases. That neurologist took one look at the way I walked and said ""i'm not trying to scare you, but something is definitely wrong with your muscles"". I cried, but they were tears of joy. Somebody finally listened to me! He ran a bunch of tests, and i'm awaiting the final diagnosis, but i'm so close. I'm so close to healing and living the life I want. I want to walk up stairs without dragging my legs, walk by dog without fear of her pulling me down if she sees a squirrel,  and to not have to scope out places to make sure I don't have to step up a curb to get to it. Keep trying. Keep complaining. Don't shut up and don't take no for an answer. Get a second, third, and even a fourth opinion. Find a doctor that listens to you. They are out there, I promise.

310,11,"Paris. The scene of the crime. You never fail to leave me used. On a pedestal and reduced to my flesh. I didn’t know how to write this so I’ll cut to the end. Some man spiked my drink.
.
I went there to be an artist. For the first time. To read poetry. It’s been two weeks since and I’m starting at the end and editing the rhyme because it’s a grubby business that doesn’t deserve art. Premeditated rape. It’s thrown me but let’s step back.
.
I did read poetry. It was beautiful. It was about the Captain. A love ditty called Find a Man and I heard the room sigh and sigh and a woman asked at the end “where do I find a man like that?” and I said “at home”. And...then, how I wanted to be home. But the game was set and there was red wine to drink and a park bench at the bar and “not all men” so I sat. And like a nice girl. A fun girl. I chatted to the barman and the other guy.
.
Statement of fact: he was 6ft. Fit build. Long dreads. Hat. Of African descent and spoke English with a self assured manner that made it impossible for two weeks to think he’d need to drug a girl to get laid. I’m a strong independent woman so I told him I wasn’t looking for anything. To chase tail elsewhere but he insisted on chatting. Before you ask, I bought my own drinks.
.
It hit that point. You know that point where the room heats up and you can’t breathe? Women know. It comes from nowhere. I made an excuse to leave. He said he’d walk me. There was no need but I’d assessed the street. It was lit and busy. Even in that state I knew I was alone in the city. It hadn’t quite registered that he knew I was too.
.
My sandals kept slipping. Now I remember slurring. I never slur but I asked him if my hotel was close. He looked at the map on my phone. “That’s not far away. I’ll walk you”.
.
We walked 100 metres. I processed it with every step. How it took me 20 minutes in a cab. How he asked if I was with those people. How I’d paid 15 euro for my drinks and how even in France that’s not enough red wine for my Polish blood.
.
I told him I was calling a cab. He turned and left.
.
Paris. I always avoid the crime but you avoid the punishment.
.
I’m home. Safe. I’m still unravelling this tomorrow. ❤️",notallmen,"|WOW! Perfect shot! We are looking MAZZOTTI family members like you.

312,13,"I’m getting tired of only hearing people talk about empowering girls and women.

Body image issues, mental health problems, pressure to always be perfect and control our emotions, isolation and finding a sense of community with similar people- all of these things are talked about as young women’s issues (and sometimes lgbtq+ people’s) in feminist communities, when they really affect ALL young people today, including young men.

The thing is, for both cultural and biological reasons, women tend be more communal than men- so as women we’ve created so many safe spaces FOR women (and lgbtq+ people to a large degree), but men, especially young men who need support just like young women do, get left out of these spaces and conversations and don’t get the same kind of community-based support and knowledge that the rest of us do online.

Yes, there are issues that women and trans people face that many men will never even have to think about- BUT this is becoming less and less true as time goes on, and particularly for Gen Z, guys don’t have as much privilege over others as they do in older generations, AND the greatest issues affecting humanity now are things that EVERYONE needs to care about and everyone needs to learn about.

I realize that many women-only spaces exist because many women are more comfortable and feel like they have a voice with other women- these spaces should still exist for the purpose of providing community, friendships, and support.

But when it comes to spaces that are focused on advocacy and education- the target audiences can’t only be half the population. Leaving men out of spaces that focus on feelings that everyone has and societal issues that everyone has a role in, perpetuates the idea that men and women are very distinct and require different knowledge about the world. If we want everyone at every level of privilege and identity to be aware of the problems that others face, then we need to share that information with EVERYONE.",notallmen,|#feminism #feminist #women #bodypositive #mentalhealth #equality #equity #intersectionalfeminism #womensrights #selfcare #toxicmasculinity #womenempowerment #notallmen (lol) #girlpower #smashthepatriarchy #patriarchy #toronto #torontoblogger #canada|Great post.|I love you ♥️|🔥👏🏼|Looking good!

Les hommes qui veulent que vous cuisiniez pour eux, que vous repassiez pour eux, que vous jouiez la psy gratuite pour eux, que vous leur appreniez comment on traite normalement une femme, mais sans donner la même intensité de soutien pour vous se comportent comme des enfants gâtés. Toutes ces actions qui seraient normales de votre part pour un enfant de quatre ans (pour VOTRE enfant de quatre ans) ne le sont pas pour un homme adulte et capable d'autonomie. L'amour inconditionnel, c'est pour vos gosses, pour votre partenaire, l'honnêteté et la prise de responsabilité de chacun À PART ÉGALE est la base indispensable de l'amour. Donc, je pose la question : est-ce que t'es sa mère ? Non? Donc arrête de l'élever.

330,31,"[LAUGH] “All things are both simultaneously deeply sacred and not sacred at all, and we must be careful about how much and what kind of meaning we attach to anything.” I am so ridiculously grateful for this mornings pull from #theknowingdeck by @cielgrove. This past week I have had these really weird experiences with social media that started to pull at my joy in life. 
This week I shared an article called “5 jeans that will find your clitoris faster than Brian”. A humorous and satirical post that highlights 5 brands that fully give you a frontal wedgie. I found this hilarious because having owned 2 pairs featured- it was absolutely true and my clit was still undecided if she actually liked it or not. 🧐

Brian, whoever he may be- was the butt of the joke. Claiming he’d be busy rubbing your belly button while your new Levi’s would hit your clitoris spot on. This set of several private messages and threads about how this article shamed mens sexual knowledge and women’s lack of communication. It was pointed out how it was only further prolonging the problem.

True. Absolutely. True. What’s also true is that it wasn’t a well written article. With no intention of shifting the sexual paradigm that presently exists. Ironically- the distaste for the article only came from women claiming that the article was hateful to men alike, while men laughed at the absurdity. 
There was a moment where I asked myself “why don’t I feel apologetic after they holding me accountable for sharing a ‘damaging’ article?” It was painful because I felt so separate from these women and the apology. “Sorry” felt inauthentic and a straight up lie for me to say, but I didn’t want them to hate me for not saying it. So I tossed back at forth from about what to do.

This mornings pull reminded me why I chose to let it be and not say the untrue. 
To me the article was a joke. A joke trying to sell women’s jeans. And yes maybe a joke that nods to “bro-culture”, where “Brian” is someone who never receives sexual adjustments from women. (Ahem. #notallmen - if you will)  Much like “Becky” is a nod to clueless white women and “Felicia” is someone to dismiss. 
CONTINUED IN COMMENTS",notallmen,"|But from what I’ve experienced being dogmatic doesn’t actually shift reality. None of us can lay down any principle as incontrovertibly true on another person. I have never changed my behaviour after being scorned. So recognizing that morals, ethics, and virtues vary from each person- what can we do? I believe that we’re better off laughing then personally taking actions that INSPIRE others into making the world a better place. 
So I laugh at the fact that I was in turmoil over how to apologize for an article about clitoris rubbing denim. I laugh at how I almost spun out and beat myself up for not ‘doing my part’. I laugh that in reality I am actively coaching women on how to communicate in the moment about their truest sexual desire, and set men to show up as absolute geniuses in their lives. I also laugh that I actively am training men to lay off he goal and performance mindset and drop into to connection. 
I am not here to “protect” - you don’t need it. I am also not here to make anyone small. I am here to support both men and women have deeper connection and intimacy. It just so happens that my work actually starts with a CLITORIS. 
I love using levity as a way to move forward past shit, especially when life is constantly grounding and heavy. My clients love it too. So let this be my plea and commitment to not lose the humour our journeys. 
You’ve only got 80 years left.",25

332,33,"With projects like 'Vicky Donor', 'Andhadhun', 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan' and lots more, Ayushmann has always proven to be an actor who is not afraid to go the extra mile in service of the script. Be it being blind, playing an asshole, taking up taboo roles like a sperm donor or even emasculating himself, he has always made choices no other commercial actor would make. But then he does a 'Dream Girl' that's not particularly nuanced or woke.

This ""not-so-self-aware"" comedy is like a whiny step sibling to 'Vicky Donor', where the sperm donation is replaced by a phone sex call center, which creates all kinds of ruckus in our protagonist's life. To make things clearer, Anu Kapoor is also here, playing an important part in the protagonist's life. There is no problem in following the success formula of what makes an ""Ayushmann Khurrana film"", even 'Badhaai Ho' did that to some extent but proved to be one of the best comedies in Bollywood. What 'Dream Girl' forgets is, sharp one-liners and interesting characters just aren't enough for a compelling dramedy. Director Raaj Shaandilyaa never plays around with the set-up and keeps his story at face value. There was potential for hilarious twists and turns if the characters were developed well. The trailers had even spoiled some of the more interesting plot lines. To make things worse, there's a lesbian feminist caricature who is just present to be mansplained in the end that, #notallmen. It's no big issue just for that though, we've had plenty of films doing it since forever. What's disappointing is getting this from an Ayushmann Khurrana film, there is zero amount of subtlety and nuance in any given scene. Everything and everyone is a caricature. To give credit where it's due, the silly gags and ""pooja/karam"" puns often times work and make for a fairly entertaining time at the theatre. 'Dream Girl' is painfully average as a social satire but works well as a 2 hour episode of that obnoxious Kapil Sharma show. People who are fine with casual sexism and homophobia might consider this the best comedy of 2019, or else I would recommend to do a Ayushmann Khurrana film marathon at home. ⭐⭐1/2",notallmen,|Agree 100%|Aaji jaithilu?,51

""Dream Girl views as a tired, boring dude-fest with all the trappings of performative feminism.

345,46,"We’re all here on Earth together. Affirming the obvious because we seem to forget. We’re divided as a nation, in a deep state of mourning and longing for peace and healing. We’ve lost our way because far too many have grown up with skewed perceptions of strength, gender archetypes, what 
acceptance means, and that women exist merely for their own objectification and satisfaction. The narrative of an unconscious nation unfolds before us. The stories that are being brought to light are only few of the countless untold stories of the rape culture that has permeated our society, that every woman has been a victim in some form or another and will be able to recall in gut-wrenchingly vivid detail if you only ask. The #aminext movement has sparked the awareness that we all desperately needed about gender based violence and we can only hope that things will begin to change with men and their understanding of consent, oppressive language and what constitutes a violation. But for now, as women, we are more alert than ever before. The perpetrators out there haven't stopped because they’ve read a post on social media or saw footage of our president addressing us outside Parliament last week and suddenly decided that what they were doing was wrong. Since last Thursday, numerous other femicides have been reported. Know that there are more that have gone unnoticed or unreported. Any one of us could truly be next. We’re conscious of who’s around us at all times, if we’re being followed or gawked at or receive an unsolicited “Mmm hey sexy” walking down the street minding our own business. We scrutinize our Uber driver’s profiles. We have security apps downloaded, open and ready if we feel threatened. We second guess our clothing choices in fear of being eyeballed (as much as we hate having to do this) because it really could mean the difference between life or death when you’re dealing with entitled men. This is the reality that we face every day. We live in a perpetual state of fear. [Continued in comments...]",notallmen,"|So if you’re seriously still perplexed by #menaretrash and are echoing the #notallmen defence, consider how you’d feel if you had to live like this, unable to distinguish the good from the bad. Recognize that you are an intrinsic part of the solution, guilty or not. We need your voices - desperately. Don’t move forward after reading this and every other post about GBV like everything’s normal. Don’t shake your head at other men and then keep going about your day. If you’re not actively engaging in uncomfortable conversations, shutting down sexist banter and standing with us in our battle for liberation from all forms of male oppression, you’re complicit in your inaction. Feminism is a movement inherently rooted in inclusivity and we urgently need everyone to recognize this as we navigate our way through damaged socio-political times. August has traditionally been a month of celebration of women but the truth is we have nothing to celebrate right now based on the way that women have suffered at the hands of men over the last few weeks. If anything, we celebrate in the little privilege we have as women if we don’t have further odds stacked against us. Feminism has been fighting typical binary gender stereotypes, bodily autonomy, and the patriarchy forever but POC, LGBTQ+ people and non-conforming genders are further discriminated against in the midst of the femicide epidemic sweeping through South Africa. So while you count your blessings if you fall under a privileged demographic, acknowledge that there are greater battles out there being fought and do what you can to use your platform and stand in support of those further oppressed in our collective plight for sheer survival. [Continued below...]|We need to lean into our power. We reorganize power with our solidarity, our rage, our call to action, our pain and our scars.

We need everyone coming together as allies to restore balance, creating awareness and cultivating compassion - the very thread that connects us in our humanity - to serve as a vehicle for change.

350,51,"Why do white men take my precautions for safety as an insult to their nation?

I don’t stand near the street or train tracks in fear of someone pushing me into the oncoming traffic or a train. I seldom walk in the dark alone in fear of someone following me with bad intentions. Luckily for me, I haven’t experienced anything more severe than racial slurs and occasional followings so far, but you never know how those things can elevate into something more fatal. When I express my fears and experiences, my female and LGBTQ friends empathize. However, white men take it as an insult to their nation. And they aspire to “enlighten” me, saying (in this case) Finland is a safe country.

Whatever issue I bring up as racism, they deflate it as quickly as possible to a personal problem. It is “that” person who is the problem. Finland is a good country. But their white abled bodies don’t get malicious, unflinching stares on the street. They are not the one who gets yelled at by drunks or asked rude questions by strangers, and at the same time, feel helpless because you cannot counterattack. I try to point out that the world I experience is different from what they as white men experience, only to be shushed and shamed.

The problem of white men deflating every societal, racial issue to a personal one is that they’re condoning the idea of white privilege, that what white men don’t experience is not a real problem. I’m the one too sensitive. The thing is that this is not an individual problem. If the society does not permit racially discriminating behavior, there will be far less accounts. So what white men should do instead of trying to shut me up and jump into defense mode is to go shut the racists up.

37 weeks have happened in 2019.
34 of those weeks represent another woman who's life was ended by the brutality of misogyny and the overflow effects of a patriarchal society which has educated us to believe in gender based entitlement.

34 women THIS YEAR!

Dead.

ITS OT OK AUSTRALIA.

Brothers... Please. Learn to curb your anger, I get it, life can be fucking horrible at times. People can be annoying, frustrating... absurdly attractive and heartbreaking... But NONE of those things are a reason to lash out and kill someone.

This is no longer about us as women.
We were brought up to believe it was. That we were too loud, too slutty, out too late, too drunk, too friendly, too foolish... That this is why we were being treated this way.

But it's not about us.

It's about you.

What are you doing to change yourself? To support yourself emotionaly? Whether or not you consider yourself to be a ""good guy""...whether or not you think #notallmen... Whether or not you believe you would be the ""kind of person"" to do this... It doesn't matter.
Changing a culture begins with changing yourself.

Not sure how you can make change? Here's some ideas: - Get a therapist or mental health plan. We ALL have shit going on deep inside ourselves, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with us. What is wrong, is not creating a life that supports yourself through it. What is wrong is pretending it's not there, not getting to know it intimately and creating a deep and loving understanding of our own inner workings, triggers, defence mechanisms... - Start attending men's spaces which are based on self reflection, radical honesty and intersectional feminism focused respect. Surround yourself with other men who are doing the work and do it together.

Continued in comments... #femicide #feminist #feminism #womensrights #womenspeak #howmanywomen #metoo #murder #bossbabe #queerstories #witchesofinstagram #speakup #strongwomen #yesallmen",notallmen,"|- Educate yourself in communication styles and anger management. (yes women need to do this too, all people of all gender... But right now.. I'm talking to you). Non-violent communication (nvc) is a good start. Anger management and constructive anger release is another. We all have anger. It's how were choose to move through it that is important.
There are SO MANY MORE ways, including voulenteering, advocacy and more. But really the key shift is not what you are DOING but who are you BEING?
Educate, practice, shift and grow. You doing it and being honest about that will inspire other men to do the same. You doing it IS CULTURAL CHANGE.
You doing these things will save lives...
34 lives this year.
34 women.
Think about it.

Dear Society,
This is not an anti-men hate speech, nor is this a cry for help. This is to remind you that even though you continuously say ‘not all men’, unfortunately you’re raising a bunch of entitled men that are threatened & offended by a woman’s choices.

In the last few weeks, the amount of abuse stories I’ve heard, have only gotten more jarring.

I heard from a girl yesterday that was raped by her own friend while they were drinking at his house. He pinned her down & threatened he’d have her disappeared if she said a word to anyone, as he raped her. Her body, covered in bruises. I saw the bruises.

A girl, so close to me, was raped by her own friend, in her sleep.

Another girl, raped by her cousin brother, his friends, & her neighbour - all between the age of 7 & 16.

I got a text from a girl who’s boyfriend ‘occasionally’ beats her black & blue, she wrote to me with tears in her eyes & blood on her face, assuring me that he did love her, he was a good man, he just... had an anger problem. She didn’t know ‘what she should do to help him’. Another girl said her boyfriend won’t wear a condom when he forcefully enters her. When she refuses, he says ‘if you love me, you wouldn’t say no.’ She would prove it... if she doesn’t, then he’ll leave her.

A friend of mine, lives on the ground floor & her neighbour, the girl upstairs, got raped by the electrician while her mother was out buying food. She had told her not to open the door, but he wanted water. Where were her manners, after all?

9 out of 10 women in our country, have been abused at some point in their lives. Read that again.

So this is not an anti-men speech, nor is it a cry for help. It’s a reminder.

Society,
Thanks to the entitled men you’re aggressively raising - women with stories of abuse are finally talking. Not all of them are strong enough to go to the police - but they’re speaking up. They’re  survivors. They’re changing our world.

You’re going to need a new hashtag; #NotAllMen isn’t going to work anymore, because #NotAllWomen are buying the entitled victim complex.

As a person who’s always been comfortable talking about taboo topics such as periods, sex, miscarriage, abortion, pregnancy and the like, reading this put my privileged AF position into perspective. I too often take for granted my right to speak and be heard, the easy access to tampons, contraception and subsidised health care I’m afforded, and how unless the world was to flip upside down, I will never be sold for marriage.

361,62,"Thank you to @miniitalian for giving me the courage to also share my story in the form of a letter. 
To my rapist,

Do you remember that night? I’ll admit, I still can’t recall every little detail. It’s amazing what the human brain is capable of, what it will do to try and retain a smidge of sanity. I spent months attempting to numb myself, to drink away your memory. I wanted to forget so badly.

I couldn’t forget though. Sure my brain originally spared me the harsh details of your depravity, but you can’t keep secrets from yourself, not for long. The rest of the world however; they could never find out. This was, after all, my fault. Wasn’t it?

I wonder what you would say if I told you how I have driven myself mad with self-blame, severe anxiety and panic attacks; that I no longer wanted to live. Would you care? Would you feel remorse? Would you feel anything at all?

The good thing about trauma is that it forces you to make a decision. Up or down, sink or swim, live or die. I knew if I was going to remain on this planet, the band aids I had used to cover my scars would need to be ripped open; the wounds cut deeper with every submission to my memory. I would have to see your face, be back in that room. You taking advantage of me. Wake up with you on top of me. My virginity stolen. 
What still blows my mind is how your best friend, the friend I met you through stayed friends with you even though I told him what you did. The same friend repeatedly invites me to parties where you would be present. The same friend continues to mention your name in front of me, opening up my wounds time after time. 
They say time heals all wounds but I disagree; eventually as time passes you just accept them. You stop trying to hide them. You realize living with scars is better than not living at all.

I decided to believe there is good out there, despite people like you who try to prove otherwise.

And I hope one day you decide to be the good.

Sincerely,
Your victim no more

So I took a break from social media...with the #femicideinSA blow up, all the #MeToo sharing (which, don’t get me wrong, NEEDS to be said), as well as the overwhelming amount of judgemental comments from women TO women, I just felt like it was getting me down and honestly, it just got be too much for me to handle...so I stepped back.

I have two options;
A) follow the crowd and post arse-focused fitness content as well as scantily-clad post-workout selfies to get more followers, brand deals etc. All the while, promoting a billion dollar industry that stole my childhood and negatively effects my mental health to this day. 
B) or, promote fitness as one form of self-care whilst trying to popularise the non-physical sides of exercise. In addition to shining a light on Diet Culture and its ability to steal your sunshine and money. Sure, it’s not as sexy... but why does everything have to be sexy anyway?!

373,74,"Since this whole #allmenaretrash bullshit showed up, I've quietly been waiting for the right moment to voice that it's all wrong. Not all men are trash. How many hours have men stayed up advocating for women's rights? How many men have lost their lives protecting women, children and for what? A slap in the face? 
How many sacrifices does a man have to fucking make day in and day out to get even the slightest bit of appreciation? But no... All men are trash... All men are trash because a woman never does anything wrong, right? I mean... Women don't rape... Women don't kill... Women don't lie... Women don't cheat... Women don't steal... No... Every gender has a sinner, every race has a sinner. Would it be polite for me to then turn around and say every German is a Nazi, to say every black person is a thief? To say that every priest is a paedophile, to say that every Islamic person is a terrorist... No. It's not okay. 
I draw this line and if you have a problem with that line, then you need to start looking in the mirror because you are what's wrong with society. Stop compartmentalizing a gender/race based on other motherfuckers disposable acts. And if by the good Lord Himself, you can't see yourself or your gender having ever done anything wrong in the existence of humankind... You are a narrow-minded fool who deserves a place in a cell next to Hitler and the rest of those fools. 
Have a nice day. 
P.S... if you want to have words, go ahead. Just make sure you bring your brain to the table instead of your emotions.

381,82,"Dear Society,
This is not an anti-men hate speech, nor is this a cry for help. This is to remind you that even though you continuously say ‘not all men’, unfortunately you’re raising a bunch of entitled men that are threatened & offended by a woman’s choices.

In the last few weeks, the amount of abuse stories I’ve heard, have only gotten more jarring.

I heard from a girl yesterday that was raped by her own friend while they were drinking at his house. He pinned her down & threatened he’d have her disappeared if she said a word to anyone, as he raped her. Her body, covered in bruises. I saw the bruises.

A girl, so close to me, was raped by her own friend, in her sleep.

Another girl, raped by her cousin brother, his friends, & her neighbour - all between the age of 7 & 16.

I got a text from a girl who’s boyfriend ‘occasionally’ beats her black & blue, she wrote to me with tears in her eyes & blood on her face, assuring me that he did love her, he was a good man, he just... had an anger problem. She didn’t know ‘what she should do to help him’. Another girl said her boyfriend won’t wear a condom when he forcefully enters her. When she refuses, he says ‘if you love me, you wouldn’t say no.’ She would prove it... if she doesn’t, then he’ll leave her.

A friend of mine, lives on the ground floor & her neighbour, the girl upstairs, got raped by the electrician while her mother was out buying food. She had told her not to open the door, but he wanted water. Where were her manners, after all?

9 out of 10 women in our country, have been abused at some point in their lives. Read that again.

So this is not an anti-men speech, nor is it a cry for help. It’s a reminder.

Society,
Thanks to the entitled men you’re aggressively raising - women with stories of abuse are finally talking. Not all of them are strong enough to go to the police - but they’re speaking up. They’re  survivors. They’re changing our world.

You’re going to need a new hashtag; #NotAllMen isn’t going to work anymore, because #NotAllWomen are buying the entitled victim complex.

So I’ll share this very weird phenomenon that people tell girls to ignore. My phone number is out on all websites due to my missing brother’s search. Now, here too I receive 3-4 calls daily that are utter nonsense. One of the fake profiles on Facebook gave out my phone numbers to many men (reported that) 
The men/women I have shared with that this is happening with me , have told me that well this was supposed to happen only you just ignore. 
IGNORE ??!! Ignore 3-4 calls daily asking me “aur kya haal hain” “jaante nhi ho toh jaan jaoge” “gussa Kyun ho rhe ho”. Dude these men are outright crossing the line. They have all being ignored in the past that’s the reason why they are calling a woman who is desperately looking for her missing brother. They have no fucking shame. And The men/women that I admire and are friends with tell me to IGNORE and normalize it. 
Please don’t normalize this behavior. I remember when I was young and I received any random call. My brother would take the phone and yell the crap out of the person calling. Why is it bad if I do that for myself? Why is it overreacting if I report it to the police ?|U proove that u r not only beautiful but also a very intelligent women also many people use instagram to only upload their pics and get more likes and increase their followers but u proove that any one can use social media to rise serious issues and try to know what people think about it so thanks to shift our focus to this very serious issue|I love for this.

In 8th i was blackmailed by 2 male acquaintances that if I don't become girlfriend of a particular person among the two; they are going to  make a page public on Facebook that has my nudes, I told my parents and police got involved there wasn't any such page, there were no mocked nudes but they had the audacity to do what they did, the guy I mentioned used to stalk me around the school all the time for almost an year even after me telling him off, he stopped after I told my teacher, he did the above mentioned after that. I have been stalked by men from my house till my house, I was in a school van, wearing a typical salwar kurta uniform. every night I take my dog out for a walk with my mom and men slow down their bikes and stare turn and look instead of keeping their eyes on the road. Sometimes I try to tell myself it's my cute pupper they are looking at just so that I don't steam off with anger.  I have been sexually harrassed by my ex-boyfriend. I still don't think every man is the same. I still believe that there are genuinely nice men. Though I have seen very few through out my life, thankfully this guy  @manigill__23  for who he is that I know there are still nice men. This is not for sympathy, or to vent either or to put men down. It is just the truth... Told to make the people who say ""feminism is bullshit"" understand it isn't, to make people understand the reason why women are so fucking angry on the sideline always...! It took me more than a decade to speak about all of this publically even after the supportive and open environment I have grown in. I know stories similar to mine that belong to guys.|So beautiful|Ur too inspiring mam but u don't reply plz rellygg plz💋💋|🔥🔥❤️|❤️❤️❤️|🔥🔥😍😍😍👅|♥️😇|Mam you have raised such  a prevailing issue in our society hats off to you, hope your message rich to million dirty mind guys . 🙌|❤️❤️|You just said everything that has been bubbling in my head❤️|I feel you!",26187

398,99,"Me gustó Venecia, es imposible que no te guste esta ciudad y por eso 30 millones de turistas la visitan an año. Esto la está poniendo en un grave peligro de desaparecer. Uno de los grandes problemas son los turistas de cruceros OYE PERO YO VIAJO EN CRUCERO Y NO SOY UN IMBECIL si, seguramente tú no, pero estamos ante un problema más grande que tú y el que te ofenda esto que estoy diciendo. Ya están como con lo de #NotAllMen si 300 turistas de cruceros son lindos y educados como tú, los otros 300,000 son culeros y lo quieras o no afectan a las ciudades como Venecia y Barcelona de forma terrible. Por qué? Pues porque traen gente en masa que tiene 1 día en la ciudad y en ese día se quiere comer al mundo, empujando, peleando, rompiendo y haciendo lo que sea necesario para tener la experiencia veneciana de sus sueños. También, los cruceros estacionados contaminan las aguas y ya han provocado accidentes porque no están hechos para los canales. Venecia no quiere a los cruceros se han manifestado y en su contra pero el tema es que por muy malos que sean generan 400 millones de euros al año, ahí nada más.
Los turistas no de cruceros también afectan a Venecia, sobre todo plataformas como Airbnb mal usada. OYE PERO COMO QUE MAL USADAS. Airbnb puede ser bueno, como lo constaté esta vez. Me quedé en casa de un músico que renta su cuarto extra en la parte de arriba de su casa, el es el dueño y con esto puede pagar sus gastos, conocer gente y permanecer en la ciudad que está súper cara ya gracias al turismo. Airbnb y cualquier sistema de renta de depas completos joden las Ciudades porque obviamente alguien prefiere ganar 10,000 euros rentando a un turista que 2,000 a un local y están expulsando a los locales de sus casas para que los turistas puedan vivir a sus anchas en Venecia. MAL, muy mal, y en Mexico vamos para allá eh, denle tiempo.
Bueno ok, estoy en un hotel, o rentando un cuarto compartiendo la casa de un local. ¿Qué otra cosa puedo hacer? 
Aprende a ser respetuoso y no molestes, por ejemplo, en Venecia no hay taxis, si tu vuelo o tren llega a las 4:00 am o a las 12:00 de la noche vas a ir por las calles arrastrando tu maleta haciendo un ruidero (Sigue en comentarios)",notallmen,"|Puedes elegir horas de llegada más decentes así no despertarás a los locales que tienen que soportar 30 millones de personas arrastradoras de maletas imagínate despertar todos los días en la noche con ese ruido?

Puedes también elegir comprar en los mercados locales para que no desaparezcan, ve y compra fruta, o algo para comer por ahí.

400,101,"TRIGGER WARNING 
I was booked to travel on a flight today from Sydney to Melbourne. Due to the high winds in Sydney, we were delayed a good hour. 
Waiting at the airport is always a tedious thing. I moved around a few times trying to find the perfect seat. Preferably somewhere with a power outlet so I could charge my phone and keep chatting to a cute fireman in my DM’s. 
I finally managed to find the coveted position I was looking for and found myself sitting next to a man of 60 and we both commented about how wonderful it was that they had chairs now with built in power stations for the weary traveler looking for some charge. 
We exchanged details of the usual sort - where we lived, how many children we had, why we were traveling - when he casually mentioned that he’d had an interesting time waiting for his flight. 
He went on to tell me about a couple who had been sitting beside him not that much earlier who had started getting into an argument that had apparently turned physical. He mentioned the throat hold he’d just witnessed so casually and with just a hint of a chuckle that for a second I thought I’d misheard him. I hadn’t though. The couple, one man, one woman, had indeed started to argue and very quickly the man grabbed the woman by the throat dragging her up out of the chair and yelling in her face. 
My neighbour then pointed to two waiting passengers not far away and indicated to me it was them he was talking about. The man was wearing jeans and a red jacket.

I had noticed this couple during the check in process. During the steady walk around the ropes to the bag drop. They were only a few people ahead of me, and I and everyone else were witness to a very noticeable PDA. I love a good PDA don’t get me wrong, but there was something about this couple that felt a little off. 
When I realised that this was the couple that the man beside me was talking about, I wasn’t surprised. In fact the PDA scene that I had witnessed earlier, seemed to somehow make more sense now. What I had felt was an unsettling feeling of power and submission. And not the consensual kind. 
Continued in comments -",notallmen,"|Well done, you did the right thing x|I'm so glad you stood up. I'm sure you were scared but you took the risk to fight for what's right and stood up. You are brave. I hope that poor lady finds the help she needs and the strength to leave her horrible situation. It is so very sad.  I hope you had a safe flight lovely xx❤️❤️|And shame on the men who turned a blind eye.......|Oh my god. I’m feeling every emotion you’re describing. I hope she has someone to turn to tonight 😞|Wow! As a father of a young girl this is a genuine concern for me that a woman can be treated with such disrespect. If I was on that flight I can guarantee that would not have happened, it’s so disappointing that not one man assisted a distressed and damaged woman. Power to you Kristy for using your platform to project this to a wider audience 👏🏻|Very disappointing a man didn’t do anything, sadly it’s the case where people do not lookout for others. Great you made a stand, if you look away you condone the behaviour.|Horrible, burgsie. I’m sorry you had to witness that. Proud of you. ❤️|Said it perfectly Kristy. I cant believe there are people out there like that who treat women like they do .. its not on!!|Thank you for standing up and doing something !!! Society is too bloody scared to do anything anymore and sadly men aren’t men anymore . Proud of you for doing what you did 🙏🏻|And shame on the men who turned a blind eye.......|Wow powerful. My skin is crawling reading that- thank you for sharing... maybe some good men reading it will be inspired to stand up if something similar crosses their path. I am definitely sharing this with my husband too. It’s everyone’s problem- bingo.|@exit82art read this...|😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹|So powerful. @clementine_ford read this powerful post|Thank you 🙏🏻 ❤️|@i.am.kristy.wright Oh dearest Kristy.. I trust you can find some peace after witnessing this. It's a reminder that it's happening every moment of the day somewhere. May the mothers of the world raise sons with love so that those sons grow into men who know that  love and respect are precious qualities. Thinking of you and the woman you encountered 😘|🙌❤️ thank you|That is so disappointing.|Wow, as a man, this has really made me think. We need to do a lot more.|@clementine_ford|Thank you for doing what you did Kristy. This is exactly what is wrong with #notallmen ????, YES WE HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM IF NOT 1 MAN STOOD THERE WITH YOU. This is a cultural problem and it the only way to Change it is to speak about it exactly like you are here. In fact, we should have social training classes on how to help women in distress and how not to be a violent, woman-hating jerk. Furious. ❤️|I couldn't stand by and watch that happen. I'd have stepped in and taught him a lesson a out respect. Those people who walked away should be ashamed of themselves 🙏|Well done @i.am.kristy.wright You did a very brave thing. Hoping that woman will be ok. I had an experience of bullying one day when i was walking my two young boys (7 & 5) home from school. Some youths were picking on this young teenager. Next minute they started kicking the crap out of him. Well i told my eldest to watch my youngest ( and to not look at what was happening). I'm just 5ft tall but i marched up to the gang & shouted stop. Had my finger on the number for the Police on my phone. I told them i was ringing the Police. Who did they think they were doing this. I walked back a little & saw a man so i shouted at him to help. He came running. He helped the young man up while i grabbed my boys. The cowards ran away. Thankfully the young man was fine. My boys were a little shaken but I'm glad i did what i did. My eldest said to me ""Mommy, you were very brave doing that"" 😊Some people really are scum. We are all humans & need to treat each other with respect :(|That happened in Eastern Suburbs, Sydney @i.am.kristy.wright|Babe you could of dropped in for a cup of tea . I’m only about 2 km from the airport .. well if you ever get stuck again ..🙏|This is insane!!!!|A vivid description of a sad situation.Would taking a video have helped? Too many situations like this occur. I approached some police in Martin place, to do something about a crazy , aggressive man. They asked for my identification & photographed my license & interrogated me, and the culprit fled.|❤️❤️X|Really good of you to take the time writing this @i.am.kristy.wright.  Stand up yes, that's the easy part as a man (myself). What's not the easy part is when the women in the situation gets abused twice as bad because of what happened at the airport. This breed of men  are dogs and if they are threatened like a dog they will attack viciously like a dog next time. This women needs to leave the situation, period. Not stay in it. There are plenty of centres to turn to. I hope she was ok when she went to sleep that night 😢|Oh my goodness, how awful!!. I sincerely hope she is ok!!! My thought was the same as yours Kristy, if he thinks it’s ok to do that in public, I dread to think what might happen when no one is watching! I hope you are ok too Kristy, that would have been very difficult to witness xx|😔😔😔|😰|😔🙏|Very distressing but I can't say I'm surprised by the lack of action from men. They're all about not tolerating it and 'i would never let stand by' until the moment it happens and yes, they do stand by.|Wonderful woman, strong in unity, even in 3.|What a woman 🙌 your amazing|I was standing on a tram once as there were no seats. A lady started yelling and swearing at me, with her face as close to mine as she could get. She believed I had been “staring at her” (I had not), she would not stop yelling and spat on me (on my shoe, not my face luckily). She was waving her arms at me and moving her body closer and closer, then back again and closer and closer again. There were men on that tram who just watched this lady do this to me. Not one person, man or woman, tried to intervene. I had never felt so scared. When the tram stopped at a stop, I pushed passed her and got off the tram, 3 stops before the one I needed to get off at.|Wow I have tears In my eyes reading this, how heartbreaking for her and for you and the other brave women ❤️|It is a problem. I’ll stand with you. I WOULD have stood with you. My blood boils over this horrible, unacceptable behavior.|Well done for helping. I'm not saying it's in any way right to do nothing but in this crazy day and age we live in, everyone, maybe especially men, are hesitant to get involved, rightly or wrongly because of fear of then being also accused of doing something wrong. I wish that wasn't the case but the good Samaritan isn't always welcomed or appreciated.|Im shocked no other man at the airport stepped up and helped her thats so terrible ,not even male staff or security either. Im hoping this poor woman now stays away from this man .|😰😢 I hope she's OK|❤️|We can only hope that any male that was a witness to this saw this mans display of violence as to intimidating for them to date stand up to him.|Wow, just wow. How awful 😭|I’ve done almost exactly the same thing in a similar scenario. You are a woman’s woman. And that’s everything 🙌🏻|I’ve stepped in several times and will continue to do so. The last time the man had hurt the lady really bad. I was driving past and saw them fighting. I drove my car towards him. He ran. I sat with her and she cried on my shoulder. I called the police. I left her in there hands. It didn’t end up going to court because she went back to him.......over and over and over. I don’t know where she is now but I hope she is safe. It is scary to step in, but like you said, if they are willing to behave that way in public what is happening at home? Men need to stand up and show other “men” it’s not ok. 🙌|The real hero in this story is the lady who took action by calling the police. 👏👏|Hope you are well, Crispy. Sending out some love🙏🏼|Alright chol|He was standing by the vending machine and she was crouched down near the seats. 
My attention was brought back to the man beside me, shaking his head as he told me about how he “almost” said something and how doing that to women showed a “lack of class”. I told him it was horrifying and that if that man was comfortable doing that to a woman in front of 150 people at an airport, imagine what he does behind closed doors. 
He looked at me like he hadn’t thought of that. 
Fifteen minutes later I thought my flight was about to board so I left my little spot to look around the corner to see if it was getting close. 
At that precise moment, the man in the red jacket stalked the lady and in a heartbeat had her pressed up against the wall between the male and female bathrooms. Right next to a water fountain. I mention this only because I saw at least 25 people walk in and out of those bathroom doors and a few even take drinks from the fountain.. with barely a glance at the scene of domestic violence occurring right beside them. 
I didn’t take my eyes off him. And her. I walked and stood about 5 paces away from them. Another woman, around 45 years of age emerged from the crowd and stood next to me in silence. In solidarity. From an entirely different gate, an ageing lady of about 70, with silver hair, also walked over to join us. The 3 of us stood there watching. Waiting. Just being a presence. Letting her know that we had her.  Then the only female airline staff member walked over beside us and radioed for the police. 
The victim, who at this stage was crying and cowering in the presence of this terrifying man who was grabbing her, kissing her, yelling at her, hitting the wall next to her head, was begging him to leave her alone. Asking him to go away. This cowering, shaking, sobbing woman.|I have never before witnessed such a scene of intimidation. My stomach was churning. My eyes were wet. It was like a curtain had been pulled back and I was seeing something I shouldn’t see. The other two female bystanders and I, as one said “we need to get her away from him” and tried to catch her eye and call her over. She was too distraught to notice though. 
After another minute or two of watching and waiting, we couldn’t take it anymore. Our collective blood boiling, we started to walk over to physically drag her away from him when the staff member told us not to approach and that the police were on their way.. And 30 seconds later they were there. Thank goodness. 
The thing that didn’t happen though? The thing that was most conspicuous in its absence? Not one man. 
#Notallmen. 
Not one man stood up. Gathered. Tried to work out a way to rescue this woman. Spoke to this man about his behaviour. Separated him from her so that we could take her into our fold and soothe her and tell her it was going to be ok and tell her that she was worth more than this. Not. One. Man. 
We were three small women ready to tackle a giant. And not one man. 
This is what women mean when we talk about being complicit in violence against women. You don’t need to raise a fist to perpetuate the problem. You just need to stand there and watch. And do nothing. Keep looking at your phones. Pretend it’s not your problem.

It is your problem. It’s all of ours. 
Stand against violence to women. Be brave. Be bold. Don’t just be good. Be the best. We’re begging you. 
I boarded the plane as the police were still talking to them both in different corners of the airport. I hope she knows she wasn’t alone. I hope she knows she doesn’t have to be. I hope she ends up ok.|Thank you for standing with her, for speaking up. If he does this in front of a crowd, what’s he doing behind closed doors?|😔❤️❤️❤️|Well done on taking the risk and getting involved! Sitting here trying to say yes I definitely would get involved but back of my mind I wonder would I be like the men there.

The only time I did get involved in a situation like that I do know I took too long to do so.  Well done on not standing by! Have a safe flight.|🤘|The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Truer words were never spoken.",432

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Guys... Guys. It truly has been a week from hell. For those of you living in South Africa, you’ll know that life around us has – in some places literally – gone up in smoke.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If we haven’t been angry we’ve been sad, depressed, anxious, fearful. It’s all just been a little too much. And the worst part? This week was not necessarily an anomaly or a freak of nature. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Sure, a lot happened all at once in terms of gender-based violence, on top of a public kidnapping and xenophobic riots… But is this any different from what happens daily in South Africa?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
What really hit home was how we’ve all learnt to live in a perpetually anxious state. Is anyone over here ever completely relaxed? At peace? Calm? Not looking over their shoulder? Not fearful of someone or something around them? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For parents, it's possibly worse. Not only are we thinking on behalf of ourselves but also each member of our family, mentally preparing ourselves for the worst and considering what action we would take if… ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This was a big topic to tackle, but necessary. Sam and Gen discuss the week’s events, acknowledging their feelings and fears as women, as moms and as South Africans. They also consider what’s next for South Africa.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So guys, where to from here? Because we've honestly had #enough.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

412,113,"Men are indeed Trash. 
EDIT: There is a 5th benefit to the term. There may even be a 6th and a 7th. But for now, the 5th benefit is that it provides a big space for all women to express their distrust in men. This lack of trust needs to be acknowledged. When a man is walking towards us in the street we are no longer compelled to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is harmless. We cannot be expected to predict which men are trustworthy and which ones will betray our trust with violence. It is either all men are trash or all men can be trusted. And we have chosen the former because boundaries have been broken over and over and over again, because trust has been betrayed in the most brutal way ever imaginable. Men did this. Men broke down any trust we have been holding on to. So if anyone feels bad for being called trash, take it up with the men that misrepresented you. It is not our responsibility to mend the representation of what you so strongly believe is your identity. It is not our responsibility to make you feel better about what it means to be a man in South Africa today. You have left us no choice but to doubt you until you have proven yourself worthy. ————————————————————————-

413,114,"To my male friends, family members and acquaintances who feel helpless in the fight to protect women from sexual assault and violence.
Leave that WhatsApp group of ""friends"", which is primarily used to share chauvinistic, sexist and disrespectful jokes, memes and videos about women. If not, you are complicit.
Call out friends, colleagues and strangers who make comments in ""jest"" about a woman's appearance; what they would like to do to her; or any such variation which ultimately categorises a woman as subhuman and undeserving of basic respect and dignity. Every time you let something like this slide, you are complicit.
If a woman tells you she has been verbally harassed, sexually assaulted, or feels uncomfortable around certain individuals or situations, believe her. Her fear is real, and if you think she is overreacting, you are complicit. ( Think for a moment why anyone would actually fabricate this and how much they would have to prove/lose after due process? )
Every woman has been, or knows someone, who was sexually assaulted. Not necessarily by that stranger at a bar, or a guy in a dark alley, or because she was wearing a skirt that was ""too short"", but by a family member, or a colleague, or a man who said he was a friend. These ARE men that YOU KNOW. Their belief that they have a right to take what they want from a woman, without her consent, is validated by your silence.
If you perpetuate the #notallmen argument - STOP. We KNOW not all men. The point is that there are enough, and any and every situation has become one in which women are at risk. It's not behind a club at 2am, it's at the post office in the middle of the day. (Ask literally any woman in your life. I can guarantee you they all have stories)

* Would you forward all those jokes, memes and videos to your Mum? Why not?
* Would you stay quiet if someone slut-shamed your sister in front of you? Why not?
* Would you insist ""it's not a big deal"" if your daughter tells you that a man groped her in a shopping center? Why not?

Don’t ostracise by generalising. It will create even more apathy. It’s time to stand together.|@willemjac maybe you might see my reasoning from this quote by a man, Brett Fish Anderson, and if not, that’s still your prerogative. “I have a box of 100 chocolates for you. I hope you will enjoy them. Oh, but by the way, I injected poison into 95 of the chocolates. But the other 5 are absolutely fine. In fact the 5 without poison are incredible, probably the best chocolate you have ever tasted. In your life. I'm not exactly sure which chocolates the 5 safe ones are but they are probably in the bottom two rows of the box. Yeah I'm fairly sure that's where the safe chocolates are. The ones with the poison in are deadly and will kill you in seconds. There is no antidote. But did I mention how incredible the 5 safe ones are?

Flip, this gift is a treat. I really hope you will enjoy them!

This is pretty much how I feel about the #NotAllMen response that has been going around and continues to be raised when situations like this come up. If you wouldn't take a chance on the chocolates even knowing there are five life-transforming ones in there, how can we possibly expect women to trust us and think we are safe and not 'those men' when the majority of sexual crimes are done by people who are known and trusted. 
And can we start to get even a little more outraged by the fact that the women in this country (not 'our women' by the way) are fearful and being raped and killed en masse than we are about the idea that someone might think we are one of them or group us unfairly...”",48

419,120,"TOXIC MASCULINITY ""The concept of toxic masculinity is used in psychology and media discussions of masculinity to refer to certain cultural norms that are associated with harm to society and to men themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered ""toxic"" due in part to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. The socialization of boys often normalizes violence, such as in the saying ""boys will be boys"" with regard to bullying and aggression""

So some of you might be upset because now finally womxn are no longer whispering NO. They are shouting it. I have heard remarks like ""how will I be able to approach a girl in a bar now, I am too scared"". Well good. Be scared because the fact that you are intimidated by all of this means you were doing it wrong in the first place. I have so much to say about all of this but I don't have enough energy left after this week to say anything really.
Womxn are taking a stand together as we did over decades but our screams are getting louder and army is getting stronger. Treat us with respect because we deserve it, not only because we demand it 
All I have to say is stop forcing your TOXICITY down our throats. NO has never meant YES

.
It’s not you they’re talking about. I’ve seen the way you treat women. You’re a good guy…
But one thing to consider, and this might come across a little harsh… Have you considered the fact that everyone, you, me, literally almost everyone we know, know a woman that have either been assaulted, abused, and in some cases have even been raped, by a male? But how is it that no one, not you, not me, literally almost no one we know, know a potential predator? But also, in how many sexual assault cases have a woman been a perpetrator or even a counterpart? This also goes to say for men that have fell victim to sexual abuse. Unfortunately the current statistics outweigh an argument to say #notallmen, because unfortunately, you, are in the minority, my friend.
This all might be a little tricky to wrap your head around, it even took me sometime. But you need to try and put yourself into that situation.
No, no. This is not about you!! Put down your guns and listen. 
Put yourself in a situation of having to deal with a woman in your life, someone really close to you, going through such an ordeal. That is the kind of approach and sensitivity this situation requires. It’s a very delicate and personal problem. The thing here is that women need you as their man to stand in agreement with them, but most of all, to protect them. Why did things have to escalate to such a degree where they had to basically almost fight this fight alone?
It’s your responsibility as the ‘#notallmen’ to look out for the potential wrongdoers in your daily, and reprimand them, right where you find them. Be it with friends at a pub, the game, or wherever you might find yourself.
.
I’ll leave you with this quote by Edmund Burke, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”
If you do nothing, you are an accomplice. So do something!! Be Daredevil, be the Punisher, or even Batman if you dare?! But do something. We shouldn’t be fighting women for #menaretrash, instead we should fight the men that caused a situation to become so dire that a simple # like that was needed, to bruise your ego in the first place.

423,124,"After things had quietened down and the crowds had dispersed I decided to head back to the gates of parliament. I wanted to take a closer look at the signs left behind after the protest and spend a minute taking it all in. 
I walked along half the fence. Standing side by side with a few men who looked honestly to feel at least some of the pain, which the woman who wrote these words were feeling. 
When I got to the statue in front of parliament a cop rolled down his window and started chatting to me. 
He first asked if I was ok. Being a woman alone in the street. We got to chatting about the protest. And life. And what kind of work I did (which even included a live demonstration of what a great sales person I am.) Then my new friend Mike asked a question which made me pause. And upon noticing my pause, he asked “if I think all men are bad”. Mike proceeded to, in a rather polite way, try reason that #notallmen. Now Mike was, from my brief interaction, not a bad guy. Mike was friendly and for most part made me feel safe. I would think Mike would protect me should our paths cross in a quiet street or a post office. But as nice a guy as Mike is, he is also the problem. 
What the world needs is more of Mark, Mike’s partner. Because as Mike tried to dig his way out of his #notallmen hole, Mark shut him down. Mark said you should respect all people. Just for being people.  Period. 
And although #alllives do matter, there are times in history when that sentiment is just not helpful. 
What we need is not the death penalty, an expensive and ineffective punishment. We need all men to be the mark to their mikes. To call the bullshit. .

424,125,"Like probably most mothers of boys in this sad country, I have wondered how to raise a man who will be better than those who created this frightening territory we women navigate daily. 
This morning, while looking for a black blazer to wear to work in honor of the #gbv protests, my husband made an extempore speech to our one-year-old that started “Your mom is off to march against toxic masculinity. Here’s how to be a non-toxic man.” I was touched by the list that followed, of things I had not quite realized had been coalescing in his brain. The ones I can remember:
1. Masculine toxins are in the air you breathe... you have to actively expel them. You can’t just assume they are not getting into you.

2. Be aware of who you are competing with and why.

3. Find people who respect and appreciate you as it will teach you to respect and appreciate others.

4. Don’t get your self-esteem from other people

5. Don’t think transactionally. Nobody owes you anything.

6. Do good things for people because you want to, not to get something from them .

7. Take up the cause of others as your own cause. 
It might be incomplete but I think it’s already a much more useful list than that If poem by Rudyard Kipling. 
What’s interesting is that none of it is about how men should treat women. It’s more fundamental, which tells you a lot about where we should be starting. Your dad is a good egg, Frankie. #notallmen

425,126,"“Enough” 61 X 76 cm oil on canvas.  I see 3 problems, women have done everything they can to keep themselves safe and it’s clearly not enough. The only thing they haven’t tried are deadly weapons, so clearly this is not up to them. You just wonder if women have to start killing men(the rapists in self Defence) until they get the message.

I think until men are actually convicted this life sentence law has a very little effect on circumstances, the problem is the conviction rate of rapists, it’s the willingness of police to actually investigate diligently, these rapists have been walking free so until we can actually get these people in prison this new policy or law does very little. 
It’s also very worrying seeing #notallmen, there’s still a large group of “men” who just don’t care and are being defensive for no reason...when people are calling South Africans Barbaric, cruel and stupid none of these “men” come out to say not all South Africans because they know who the people being addressed are the ones committing Xenophobic acts, so if you could kindly put your pride aside and show the same energy towards women if you’ve done nothing wrong that would be great, it’s not about defending your “reputation” but women.

▪️Photo 2 #leighandrejegels a well known boxer was shot and killed by her boyfriend.
▪️Photo 3 #AyakhaJiyane and her 3 siblings were murdered by their step father.
▪️And then there have been pockets of xenophophic attacks in Johannesburg and Pretoria. This is unfortunate and it doesn't help that there are many false videos and information causing alarm online. I want to thank you for your concern,texts and dms. We're fine, safe and not close to the hotspots atm.

Today, I joined thousands of women and men march to the parliament of South Africa to demand  government recognition and immediate action violence against women. 
Because #enoughisenough
Because women have done and continue to do all we can to police our bodies but real change comes from men taking responsibility for their actions.
Real change comes from teaching our boys, and men to respect themselves and respect women.
Real change comes from setting stronger measures in place to protect women, to prevent these people from committing these gruesome acts, and to make them pay when they do. 
A protest is not a magical solution but it is the beginning of a process. 
P. S. I'm not interested in responding to the #teachwomen #notallmen and #whataboutmen choruses because 1. I have learned to value my peace of mind

Cis het men need to be included in the fight for equality, yes. They need to be brought along, yes. But is that the responsibility of non cis men? I’m genuinely curious. There’s plenty. PLENTY. of feminist (remember, feminism = equality) cis het men out there who can and should be doing that work.

I don’t exist for male consumption. I’m well aware that softening myself up, smiling more for the camera, being more friendly, happy, and docile, would probably lead to more opportunities and win me more male friends. But I don’t need MORE male friends. I need BETTER male friends.

All of this stuff feels really messy and hurtful, and maybe like I’m attacking men. I know it feels like that to some women out there, too. But I’m not. And it’s not my responsibility to explain the difference between an attack and a call for accountability.

435,136,"""So I ask you to consider when you jump in to defend
How did speaking up for women become slandering of men?
Why is it when I voice my fears you first defend your brothers
Instead of listening to your sisters, mothers or your lovers?
I need you to hear my voice and listen to my fears
But you keep on shouting louder and my voice just disappears. 
Not all men will listen, not all men understand
You tell me you are ‘not all men’, a verbal sleight of hand.
I can look at you and love you, and yet still be afraid
While so much deadly violence still seems to be man-made

436,137,"Jesse, Lynette, Nolundi, Meghan, Uyinene, Janika & Leighandre are all women murdered by men in South Africa in August, the country’s #WomensMonth 🖤 I only learnt of these victims through the news🥺

It has been a tough week in South Africa with many cries of #EnoughIsEnough #SAShutdown wanting to fight back against the countless and nameless rape and murders.

Crime is everywhere, all over the world. We are not the law or justice system, we can only start where we have our own power to influence the right way. With the current powers that run the government and judicial systems, the death penalty in my opinion is not the right answer. Why do you want to give these people, who you don’t agree with in power, the authority to kill?

We need to start from a place of love. We need to question people we know with the wrong mindset. We need to put the record straight. It won’t work if you do it from a place of being selfish or hatred - that solves nothing.

If you know someone has done something wrong, be a warrior of love to fix that. Tell your truth and let no one stop you until you have. Attract likeminded people to create a shift. Call people out when they are doing something wrong. YOU NEED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE EVERYDAY IN LOVE. That’s where it starts, with beautiful-awesome you.

I have seen amazing conversations of gentlemen like my great friend @zwideservesbass who want to change the language and culture towards woman - that’s already a starting point, in one area (rape/sexual assault, abuse, domestic violent). What/who else can you influence to be better as a whole?

That one life we contribute to in love maybe that young lady or gent will run the country one day and improve the quality and value of lives for the greater good.

Start the conversation, start the thinking, let the process begin...but remember you can only see results if you do it through love. @markstent was a catalyst to my starting and influencing of this heartfelt conversation...what will be yours?

Enough blood has been shed.

#killitwithkindness #EnoughIsEnough #SAShutdown #keepyourheartclean #13reasonswhy #AmINext",notallmen,"|I’m with you Lisa ✊🏾|To my male friends, family members and acquaintances who feel helpless in the fight to protect women from sexual assault and violence. ▪️Leave that WhatsApp group of ""friends"", which is primarily used to share chauvinistic, sexist and disrespectful jokes, memes and videos about women. If not, you are complicit. ▪️Call out friends, colleagues and strangers who make comments in ""jest"" about a woman's appearance; what they would like to do to her; or any such variation which ultimately categorises a woman as subhuman and undeserving of basic respect and dignity. Every time you let something like this slide, you are complicit. ▪️If a woman tells you she has been verbally harassed, sexually assaulted, or feels uncomfortable around certain individuals or situations, believe her. Her fear is real, and if you think she is overreacting, you are complicit. (Think for a moment why anyone would actually fabricate this and how much they would have to prove/lose after due process?)|▪️Every woman has been, or knows someone, who was sexually assaulted. Not necessarily by that stranger at a bar, or a guy in a dark alley, or because she was wearing a skirt that was ""too short"", but by a family member, or a colleague, or a man who said he was a friend. These ARE men that YOU KNOW. Their belief that they have a right to take what they want from a woman, without her consent, is validated by your silence. ▪️If you perpetuate the #notallmen argument - STOP. We KNOW not all men. The point is that there are enough, and any and every situation has become one in which women are at risk. It's not behind a club at 2am, it's at the post office in the middle of the day. (Ask literally any woman in your life. I can guarantee you they all have stories - SERIOUSLY THIS... ASK! BECAUSE WE ALL DO.) ▪️If you still cannot comprehend the scope of the above, please try putting it into a context you can identify with, although I am by no means suggesting that a stranger is less deserving of your respect and help than a woman you know: * Would you forward all those jokes, memes and videos to your Mum? Why not?
* Would you stay quiet if someone slut-shamed your sister in front of you? Why not?
* Would you insist ""it's not a big deal"" if your daughter tells you that a man groped her in a shopping centre? Why not? ▪️#AmINext|#protestagainstrape #protestagainstgenderbasedviolence #protestagainstgbv #dontrape #menmustlearntolead #womensrights #mybodymychoice|🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥",28

438,139,"""When I say I am afraid of men who mean me harm,
You tell me not to make a fuss, there’s no need for alarm;
That not all men are like that, not to stress my pretty head
Or talk about those other men; just look at you instead.
But what of women suffering, a slap, a punch, a shove,
A life of menacing oppression from a man they love. 
Not all men are sexist, not all men disrespect
Not all men are the man who harms what he should protect
Not all men are vicious, not all men are brutes
Not all men are the man who punches, rapes and shoots.
Not all men use violence, most are courteous and kind
But when I talk of toxic men the others feel maligned.""

#southafrica",notallmen,"|Brilliant post #agreed #enoughisenough|❤️❤️❤️, agree with you fully, all we can do at this time is pray for our country.|I loved your blog post and I'm so sorry for what you have been through. I also haven't used those hashtags, but I understand where they are coming from and why they are being used. I very strongly believe that we should be looking at the language we use when talking about these things and when it's being reported in the media and we HAVE to change the narative from highligting the ""victimhood"" of women to putting responsibility on the purpetrator who does the horrible things. We have to shift the focus.  I also very firmly believe that men should stop being silent and stand up for women when inappropriate jokes are made and images are shared. They need to realise how it degrades women and that it is disrespectful.  They need to realise that a rape joke normalises rape. That the crude language they use normalises the wrong behaviour and when they use it, they give each other permission to act badly. They need to realise (and I am sure you do) how the way we speak about women to young boys inform their opinions and how they treat girls and women.  We need to stop saying: ""Boys will be boys"" because the message we are sending to our boys and girls are that it's okay to be violent and disrespectful because you are a boy. We need to stop teaching girls that boys are mean to them because they like them. It's messed up. To me, if the men are trash movement makes a man think about his actions or non-actions in times when women are being disrespected and degraded. If he can honestly say that he does not participate in comversations where women are degraded and disrespected, he has no imaged and jokes on his phone that degrades and disrespects women and he stands up for women in those conversations, he should not be affected by the words, men are trash. If he can not say those things, he needs to take a hard look at himself and his actions and he needs to own up to his part in creating a society where it has become normal for women to be raped and murdered. #rapeculture is real.|Love it, 💙💙 we are both raising amazing men🍃 and will continue to be strong positive women 💪🏽🌸|Great blog post and what you are saying makes complete sense. Not all men are trash and I completely stand with you on this. Same with “am I next” - we as woman are powerful and for that we should stand strong and be the fighters we are. That statement to me feels like we are giving up and I refuse to give up. Sorry for all that has happened to you and yes, we can change things by starting at home with our kids... teach them to be better than the current generation 😉|❤️❤️👌👌🙏🙏|I also very firmly believe that women shpuld question their actions and words. Of we call each other sluts and whores, we give men permission to do it. We have to stand up for each other and protect each other. We have to support each other. We have to create safe environments for victims to speak up and we have to empower them to take charge and pursue cases against the perpetrators.  PLEASE do not feel guilty for the times that you haven't sayd anything. Society has not created a safe space for ypu to speak up. Our society still #victimblames and #victimshames and tells women that they shpuld be flattered with the attention.  Until we stop that, victims will not feel confortable to speak up and take action.|Yes! Great post! 🙌🏻|Thank you for sharing. I agree those two hashtags are really just taking our power away. We need to approach these problems from a place of power.|I will also not be using the ‘men are trash’ hashtag. It just isn’t fair to paint one entire gender with the same brush.

We rise 🔥 and I am part of the SOLUTION!|Actually just posted about this too my friend. I’m ‘n fighter too and never give up my power, not to anyone.|The Men are Trash hashtag isn’t supposed to get people saying “but my father/boyfriend/uncle is not trash”. How do I know that? If I walked past your father on an empty street I’d fear him. THATS the point. 
It’s not whether they specifically abused a woman, it’s the fact that women are afraid of all men they don’t know because the reality is that 1in4 woman are abused by men.

It’s not to get defensive, it’s to spark action, to ignite change.

And AmINext is not victim mentality. It does not mean you’re not powerful. Are we saying all those women who were raped and killed were not powerful? Are we calling them weak?
I’m sure they too fought till the bitter end. 
AmINext means that it can happen to anyone. It can happen to fierce women, strong women, women who “slay”. The reality is that the startling statistics show that anyone of us can be next. 
That is the truth. That is the point. And THATS why we need things to change.|I absolutely agree with your words and stand by what you said. I am not bringing up “trash” and I will not speak those thee words over my life... Working in a male dominant environment I have also learned to just ignore advances and always said “oh well part of working in this environment” but that taking my power away. #enoughisenough 
This has to stop....|Wow what a great read! And I agree I havent used those two hashtags as well for the EXACT reasons you mentioned...i took have had unfortunate experiences😖 but i too have great men in my life:my dad, my husband, my brother to name but a few❤️ and I'm a mom to two boys...so wonderful to have someone share my views and not be afraid to speak up on those particular hashtags as well as viewpoints. Thank you for getting me🙌😘😘|Your courage is amazing. I feel strongly about the Am I next movement to bring awareness, I do however also believe that women are strong. But you have a right to your opinion and not everyone will agree with it.

It’s the same as saying all women who wear short skirts are sluts? We are doing exactly what some men do by using this #. I have an amazing man and know many men who are so great and because of this # are categorized under the same name as a rapist/murderer/paedophile! It’s not the right #! We need to come up with some better than this! 
Why must good men be labeled as trash because of real trash? I am an abuse survivor and I only survived because of some great men who were part of my life at the time. These men helped me where most women wouldn’t. So I can personally say this # is trash! #trashthemenaretrashhashtag!
My opinion 🙏🏻|With you 🙌 What about our sons? Is their identity wrapped up in that label? God forbid , because they will become what you label them as. Labeling all men as trash is just false. My husband us not perfect but is certainly not trash!|Such a profound Blog post.

442,143,"Numb:deprived of the power of physical sensation.
I was looking for an adjective that best describes the internal turmoil I feel about the ONGOING femicide in a country I once called home. This is not home. Home is a place where you panic attacks the moment you leave your house. Home is not a place where you live in constant fear that everyday could be your last. Where simple day to day errands like going to school, taking an uber, going to work, going to the mall. Going to the park, going to the library or even doing the simple task of going to the post office could lead to your demise! Home is not a place where the perpetrator can commit horrendous crimes next to a police station and have the FUCKING nerve to smile and say 'lomtana ibendisokolisa'. THIS IS NOT HOME! Hell is not other people, hell is South African men who rather protect a rapist. Men who are more concerned about being called trash then safety of the woman and children they claim to love. Do these men know what it's like to cringe, panic and say a million prayers every time a man attempts to interact with you? Do you know what it feels to pray that your response to their pathetic cat calls does trigger a reaction that's your rape and murder. But these men are more concerned about #NOTALLMEN.

I was acutely aware of my whiteness and privilege, standing among people of colour whose lives and bodies are and always have been at far greater risk than mine.

It’s impossible to remove yourself from the situation, these are our mothers, our sisters and our daughters. They owe us nothing but give us everything, love, warmth and a home. And we fail them everyday. Everyday WE make our women feel unsafe. Everyday WE express misogynistic opinions on their lives. Everyday WE feel entitled to their bodies. Everyday WE take. 
I feel shame and guilt, because as a man I have the potential to harm and destroy. I have the potential to steal a women’s light. You are part of the problem. I am part of the problem. WE ARE TRASH. 
Show some accountability. I take full responsibility for my thoughts, words and actions. And I’m holding my friends to the same standard. Women are our past, present and future. Without them we are nothing. Stop tearing them down. And start celebrating and building them up. 
WE ARE TRASH. MEN ARE TRASH.

452,153,"Let’s all thank Stephen for self-selecting, and choosing not to join @strengthforallnyc, because the women in the gym were not “welcoming” enough upon his arrival.

Thank you, Stephen.

Thank you, @strengthforallnyc members. You’re perfect.

The truth is, we have many male members. We have members of all gender identities. “Strength For All” is code for “all people are welcome here, we intentionally designed the space to make that clear,”— unfortunately, for Stephen, he’s grown up in a world that centers the needs of a few (men) over the needs of many (everyone else). To him, inclusion feels exclusionary.

Maybe he never felt excluded before or unwelcome in a space simply because of who he is. I imagine it must be jarring to feel like you stand out in a room because you are different than everyone else in that room.

Maybe Stephen doesn’t exist. I can’t find any record of him taking a class with us. Maybe Stephen is everywhere and nowhere at once. #notallmen

We’ve got some new class offerings coming your way, including ALLFit— high intensity, strength and conditioning, drop-in classes for just $15 a pop. Everyone is welcome— Including Stephen. If he can get over himself.

Also, side note, do you support trans women competing against biological women?|to me this reads like the very fact that he didn’t see a lot of other men there made him feel like men weren’t welcome, which is overwhelmingly common for women at strength gyms.

But your point about doing the work is quite thought provoking... So I have a question. Your partner who is a man I’m assuming, is doing or willing to do the work, self work looking at the inner, as are you. I also am doing this work, and I guess a lot of people in our wider network are open to self discovery and taking a very real and deep look within themselves, to hold space for this and as a result move with more compassion gentleness and love for themselves and for others. But there are people, men in the example you give, but also women who are just not anywhere near being open to this form of self reflection. There are people that at least in outward manifestation don’t appear to give a shit about other people at all, less of to move gently and love others or themselves.... So (I’ve just realised this is a three part question apols)... Is just being the change enough? How do you reach them if it’s not enough?

Amongst all the outrage and sadness that is filling the feeds of South Africans during this very dark time, I saw a stat that said it is estimated over 40% of womxn in South Africa will be raped by men during their lifetime.

I am already one of those womxn. Already a statistic. And yet, I still ask myself today #aminext?

I should not have to say that I am lucky that it didn't go further, that I did not lose my life like so many others have. I should not have to feel fear of violation and murder every day when I take an uber, walk down the street or sit at home alone. I should not have to weep for the lives of womxn I never knew because their power and their lives were taken senselessly and unfairly, knowing it could easily have been me or someone I love.

I should not have to waste my dwindling energy on explaining why now is not the time for outcries of #notallmen.

I should not have to feel pressure to speak out during a time where I feel paralyzed and retraumatised by an influx of triggering posts that have sent me into bewilderment and self-destruction.

I have seen people complaining that women not speaking out about what is going on in SA right now are part of the problem. If you believe this, please check yourself. You do not know everyone's story. Sometimes speaking out means outing ourselves and our trauma and whilst I mustered the strength to do that today, not everyone can and we dont owe anyone shit!

For all of you who are feeling exhausted, devastated and fearful, I send what love I can from my broken heart to yours.

Rest in power to all the children, womxn, femmes and marginalized who have lost their lives because our country can't face up to the deeply rooted issues it needs to address.

Condolences to every family member and friend who is griefstricken right now. Enough is enough.

Please sign the petition in my bio for the SA Gov to declare gender based violence an emergency in SA. I'll also be joining a gathering outside parliament tomorrow in CT at 10:30 to hold our government accountable. Join if you can.

We worry about every single aspect of their well being and still we want them to go into the world to discover and explore and be free. Not to be crushed in the hands of a monster, a stranger, an uncle, a father.

468,169,"To my male friends, family members and acquaintances who feel helpless in the fight to protect women from sexual assault and violence. ▪️Leave that WhatsApp group of ""friends"", which is primarily used to share chauvinistic, sexist and disrespectful jokes, memes and videos about women. If not, you are complicit.
▪️Call out friends, colleagues and strangers who make comments in ""jest"" about a woman's appearance; what they would like to do to her; or any such variation which ultimately categorises a woman as subhuman and undeserving of basic respect and dignity. Every time you let something like this slide, you are complicit.
▪️If a woman tells you she has been verbally harassed, sexually assaulted, or feels uncomfortable around certain individuals or situations, believe her. Her fear is real, and if you think she is overreacting, you are complicit. ( Think for a moment why anyone would actually fabricate this and how much they would have to prove/lose after due process? )
▪️Every woman has been, or knows someone, who was sexually assaulted. Not necessarily by that stranger at a bar, or a guy in a dark alley, or because she was wearing a skirt that was ""too short"", but by a family member, or a colleague, or a man who said he was a friend. These ARE men that YOU KNOW. Their belief that they have a right to take what they want from a woman, without her consent, is validated by your silence.
▪️If you perpetuate the #notallmen argument - STOP. We KNOW not all men. The point is that there are enough, and any and every situation has become one in which women are at risk. It's not behind a club at 2am, it's at the post office in the middle of the day. (Ask literally any woman in your life. I can guarantee you they all have stories)
▪️If you still cannot comprehend the scope of the above, please try putting it into a context you can identify with, although I am by no means suggesting that a stranger is less deserving of your respect and help than a woman you know: * Would you forward all those jokes, memes and videos to your Mum? Why not?
* Would you stay quiet if someone slut-shamed your sister in front of you? Why not?

▪️Leave that WhatsApp group of ""friends"", which is primarily used to share chauvinistic, sexist and disrespectful jokes, memes and videos about women. If not, you are complicit.
▪️Call out friends, colleagues and strangers who make comments in ""jest"" about a woman's appearance; what they would like to do to her; or any such variation which ultimately categorises a woman as subhuman and undeserving of basic respect and dignity. Every time you let something like this slide, you are complicit.
▪️If a woman tells you she has been verbally harassed, sexually assaulted, or feels uncomfortable around certain individuals or situations, believe her. Her fear is real, and if you think she is overreacting, you are complicit. ( Think for a moment why anyone would actually fabricate this and how much they would have to prove/lose after due process? )
▪️Every woman has been, or knows someone, who was sexually assaulted. Not necessarily by that stranger at a bar, or a guy in a dark alley, or because she was wearing a skirt that was ""too short"", but by a family member, or a colleague, or a man who said he was a friend. These ARE men that YOU KNOW. Their belief that they have a right to take what they want from a woman, without her consent, is validated by your silence.
▪️If you perpetuate the #notallmen argument - STOP. We KNOW not all men. The point is that there are enough, and any and every situation has become one in which women are at risk. It's not behind a club at 2am, it's at the post office in the middle of the day. (Ask literally any woman in your life. I can guarantee you they all have stories)

482,183,"I don't get angry on here. But today, I CRIED for a woman whom I never met. I cried because I could only imagine her absolute TERROR. I cried because no matter what she and other victims did, she had no chance against her attacker. I cried because I saw myself in her. She could've been me. She could've been any of us. She was getting a parcel at the post office. The post office.
.
I first heard the above quote from my 8th grade English teacher. It sent chills down my body then, and the truth of it sends chills down my body now. Every year since then, news, other women's stories and personal experiences have proven it to be true.
.
For too long, the world has told us HOW TO NOT get raped: don't dress this way, don't speak to him like that, don't walk there alone - at that time, in that way. All behaviour that WE need to control so that WE don't provoke our future attacker to lose his. All teachings that were repeated to me countless of times, just because I was born with a vagina. Why are men punishing us for this? Why does the world ask what we did, instead of asking why he did it?
.
To the guys who dare use #notallmen: stop making the conversation about yourself. Excuse us for fearing for our lives and not giving you a shout out in the process. We shouldn't shift the focus on this war against womanhood, so we can applaud you for doing the right thing. Because of the nature of the violence that we fear being subjected to by your gender mates, we cannot win this without you. You want us to stop saying #menaretrash? Then: stand up for the woman who is being catcalled or verbally harassed at your next social gathering. Call out your 'brother' who targets drunk girls. Stop looking away when your friend slaps his girlfriend. MAN UP. Use your strength to PROTECT, FIGHT WITH and FOR US. Use your privileged position in society, with the lack of daily fear for your life and actually DO something. It's just not good enough not being the abuser.

How are we to know that we shouldn't fear them? Do you know their every thought and behaviour?

We are angry. We ARE next. We are sitting ducks for all forms of abuse in this country. Please listen to us and stop dismissing our valid fears and anger. Stand with us and for us. Pray for us.

When did we become a country where it is okay to not cherish women and children? We have endless campaigns that are all about ""how to protect yourself as a women"" but what about the men? Where are the campaigns, stories and endless talks about how to keep women safe? 
We are a country that has endured so much, but yet there is this massive hole where we should be protecting ourselves, our sisters AND brothers. 
Yes we are sisters AND brothers, I know that there is this divide between genders but is that not what God made us to be? Granted that not everyone believes in Him or worships their own gods.

As women we are told to watch what we say because that might not attract the ""right"" kind of people - does that mean to stay silent?
As women we are told to be watch what we wear because that might not attract the ""right"" kind of people - does that mean that we shouldnt use clothing to express ourselves?

Enough is enough! 
Why can we not just walk down a street and have men greet us politely and not have cat calls?

When I'm alone or alone with my kids and a man approaches us - I don't wonder if he is a loving father, a husband or a kind gentleman... I wonder if I should be afraid of him. You don't let a snake bite you to find out if it's poisonous. Our kids aren't safe at school, we aren't safe in our cars, our homes, the post office, walking down the street, at work or... Anywhere for that matter. We live in a country where it's easier to get raped than finding a job... Our justice system is failing us, the country is failing us. When will it be enough? How many women have to get murdered? You can shout that men get murdered too... But I very rarely see news on my timeline of men being murdered, assaulted or raped by women. We have a problem.

I kept my kids home from school today, I couldn't let them go. I needed to hold them tighter, love them more and be grateful that they are safe in my arms. We chatted over breakfast about kidnapping, safety, sexual assault and what they should do if they ever feel scared or uncomfortable. It was a tough conversation, but I don't see any other option than to prepare them... To keep them safe. Fear is good. Fear helps you run. 
Today I'm thinking of every woman in this country who has been verbally abused, sexually assaulted, beaten, raped, murdered, kidnapped, sold.

All men shouldn't be put in the same box as those that go out to kill, rape and destroy lives. The names of those men that go out to destroy lives should be made more public just as their victims names are, this way we don't just say ""MEN"" when a women is raped and murdered, this way we'll know who these sick individuals are. 
I have good men in my life, I have brothers, I am raising a boy and it's extremely important that I teach him that we don't judge someone by their colour much less their gender but by who they are as individuals. I have a partner that wakes up to put our son to sleep when I'm too tired and this is after his come back from a hard day's work. This is a good man, he is an exceptional father.

Il a matché uniquement pour la description (où est précisé que ne sont pas recherchés les sexistes, les racistes, les bigots, les homophobes etc.) et se fritter. Tout comme de l'autre côté, le swipe s'est fait à droite uniquement pour le confronter. C'est le genre de microagressions auxquelles les femmes sur les appli sont confrontées tous les jours.

I'm waking up heart broken.  I don't need to ask the question ""Am I next?"" Because I've lived through the rape. Twice.

My timeline is like a broken hymn at a funeral. So many mother's, sisters, daughters expressing their fear and anguish. 
I'll be dressed in black all week because when the rest of SA moves on, they will still hunt us down. Until Cyril makes a statement with regards to our laws, we will never be safe. Until Mr ""Shoot to Kill"" Cele can explain his silence, the body count will continue ro rise.

Today I mourn the hard realisation that the MEN in SOUTH AFRICAN have failed us. 
You have killed us.

And please, spare us you #NotAllMen .... asinaxesha la lontho.

513,214,"Uyinene, I am so sorry. ⁣
Today I sit here, ashamed, thinking: That could have been me.⁣
⁣
I think sometimes that I am lucky to have escaped rape and assault, and then I think what a thought that is. ⁣
⁣
I - like many of you, like Uyinene probably did- play to the Rules of Rape:⁣
I never walk alone, at night, in unsafe areas. I dress more modestly than I'd like, to avoid attention I don't want. I wear sneakers if I'm walking incase I need to run. I avoid eye contact with strange men instead of confront their catcalls straight on. I wait inside until my Uber has come, and I send my location to someone. But I know there are women out there who have all these things done, and they STILL become yet 'another one'.⁣
⁣
I see #NotAllMen trending; a hashtag filled with women and men who choose to respond to justified anger with offense instead of understanding and action. Instead of asking themselves: why does rape happen?⁣
⁣
We allow it to thrive under myths, thinking it only happens under certain circumstances, to certain women, by 'bad' guys, in dark places. ⁣
Not when running errands and fetching mail at the post office.⁣
Not in public toilets and bright forests. ⁣
Not during the day. ⁣
Not in your own home, by someone you'd never say. ⁣
⁣
We fear :⁣
The resignation when an accused is excused without further investigation. The frustration when a victims statement is called 'an exaggeration' . The silent shame when a story is held in because she mustn't 'make a scene', for fear of blame, and ostracization. ⁣
⁣
When will we stop ignoring, avoiding, #NotAllMen-ing, denying, excusing and justifying - while women in South Africa are dying. ⁣
⁣
Today it might not be me, but tomorrow it could be.

Combien sont celles d’entres vous aujourd’hui qui ne peuvent se joindre à moi en partageant une de leurs histoires personnelles liées à des agressions sexuelles, dans la rue, à l’école, au super marché ou à la salle de sport... Aujourd’hui mais depuis longtemps, je suis fatiguée de me battre au nom de la femme. Pourquoi devons nous nous battre, quotidiennement, pour simplement « être », pour simplement vivre. 
A tous les hommes ici, ceux de mon Instagram, ceux qui vont s’attarder à lire. Éduquez-vous. Éduquez vos srab, ceux avec qui vous plaisantez dans la rue, en charriant « gentillement » une fille qui passe dans la rue sur sa tenue vestimentaire ou son apparence physique. Ça ne nous intéresse pas votre avis sur notre paraître. Non je ne porte pas cette robe pour attirer ton attention. Arrêtez de nous siffler dans la rue, de nous suivre ou de nous insulter si on vous ignore. 
À toutes les femmes, lorsque j’avais 15ans, je me promenais dans la ville avec ma meilleure amie @tolune de l’époque. Elle portait une robe. En croisant un autre groupe de jeune fille de notre âge, elle s’est faite insulter, de pute. A l’époque déjà j’hurlais au scandale sur le jugement que même une femme pouvait porter à une autre femme. Je m’en souviens, j’ai aujourd’hui 23ans.

À toutes les femmes, respectez vous, soutenez-vous. Arrêtez de vous juger entre vous. Nous ne sommes pas des putes, aucune d’entres nous.

⚡️ Est-ce vraiment du sexisme ordinaire ? ⚡️
Oui : Dans ce témoignage est fait une remarque qui contribue à renforcer la culture du viol. Justifier un crime par la question biologique ou vestimentaire, c’est enlever au coupable toute la responsabilité de son acte. De plus, on pense à tord que le désir sexuel masculin est plus intense et plus bavard que le désir sexuel féminin, ce qui est faux : c’est un stéréotype. Le désir sexuel dépend d’un tas de facteurs indépendants de notre sexe, genre ou de la nature des hormones que l’on sécrète explique Alexandra Hubin, docteure en sexologie.

Ça me rappelle une fois, assez récente, où on m'a présenté quelqu'un avec qui j'avais des points communs et affinités et au lieu de se dire qu'on pourrait être pote, nos potes en commun m'ont demandé s'il m'intéressait et si on pourrait pas se pécho.

540,241,"Things I could never tell you:
.
1. The day I told you that I loved you, my mind began a tug of war with my heart. My mind screamed– NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NOT.... Not Again! My heart drummed on the walls of its cage trying to spread out it's wings of love and fly once again. The tug of war left my soul shredded into strands and it's battlecry came out as ""I love you"" and nothing but silence. In that silence that followed were a million heartbeats lost, a thousand caged birds set free and in the clapping of their wings was the dawn of a hope that maybe this time, this love will find a way through, that maybe this time, I'd found a love that stays.
.
2. My life was a labyrinth that brought me back to where I started every time I decided to start again. I didn't have any idea about the whats, whys and hows of my life. You took my hand, placed yours on mine and showed me how we create a picturesque with the black and white pallet of our hearts. I never asked you how's your world so colourful if all our heart knows is black and white. But soon I knew the answer. It was love. It was always love but maybe you never saw it even when it surrounded you, covered you like a blanket keeping your beautiful soul so safe and warm that one couldn't help but fall in love with you. I never told you that I wished you did see this love. (I still do)
.
3. I heard your voice on days when keeping myself calm was the hardest thing to do. Your voice kept telling me, ever so calmly, to breathe, to live a little more before I ran, before I broke once again. I did. Breathing in and breathing out, one heartbeat after another, I lived with a smile that, people said, was full of hope. Maybe it was you. It was always you keeping my breaths running, my heart beating and my love going on for what I thought was forever. I never told you that a voice inside me kept telling me to let you go, until I finally did.
.
{Continued in the comments}",notallmen,"|4. I looked at your pictures, gazed at those eyes that reminded me of the morning sun. Your smile reminded me of the moon that knows how to shine when no sun is there to keep you warm. Soon, you became my horizon where my sky and my ocean met. I never told you that your pictures reminded me how to rise with the dawn and set with the dusk, but you'd never believed me, did you? You only made me fall deeper for you.
.
5. The day I let you go and you told me that maybe I never loved you, pieces of me fell off like dead skin, parts of my soul shivered in the space emptied when you left and my heart– it cried. It cried an apology for all the times I'd hurt you. It cried out a pain that became a part of me. It cried, ""I still love you. I never lied."" It cried in hope that maybe you'll hear it cry, in hope that maybe you'll see the love I've for you, in hope that maybe you'll tell me you love me and make me stay. You never did. You never did and I cried. So I let you go even if all that'd fill the empty space after you was pain. I let you go even when I knew that I'll never be able to love someone the way I loved you. I let you go even though I loved you. And the thing I'll never tell you is that I still love you. ©Debojit|[Picture from Pinterest]|#feminist #feminism #equality #genderequality #girlswhostandforgirls #notallmen #metoo #metooindia #speakup #bringthechange #strongwomenempowerwomen #men #man #empowerwomen #change #timesup #feministboys #harassment #rapes #abuse #molestation #respectgirls #society #menwillbemen #motivation #encouragement #positivity #quotesforyou #poemsofinstagram|This was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time, you did a beautiful job gif guy. 💓|Wow..that's great..",33

Ladies, when you don’t make him earn you, you do him a great disservice. He will feel unworthy. And he will resent you for making him feel unworthy. 
We think to have sex casually makes us equal. But we are unwilling to accept the consequence of setting in motion this sequence of relating. 
We may have an equal right to initiate the act without shame.  But our response will always be out of balance, because the science of our body-mind system says that women cannot relate casually. 
Instead, we use each other.  Women often use men to feel a connection, to prove a point, to get over someone, to self-destruct.  The differences between the system of a man and a woman dictate that we will always lose this game. 
We become upset that he treats us casually.  But all he is doing is responding to how we have treated ourselves.  In reality, we are angry with ourselves for treating the precious gift of our physical, spiritual and emotional presence casually. 
And then we bring this self-loathing to the next man we encounter. 
The change must start with women. “If every woman makes every man so born to respect, respect, respect, then there should be no cruelty, no disorder, no mental cruelty, no crime on this whole planet, the world would be just heaven.” - Yogi Bhajan

559,260,"Some relationship lessons I’ve learnt this year:
.
• You’ll never be ready, but if someone makes you feel alive take the risk.
.
• Deciding what you want for dinner is difficult.
.
• You don’t always have to have a life plan, sometimes you can just let go and trust.
.
• Being decisive is sexy.... even if that’s just deciding what you’re having for dinner.
.
• If somebody doesn’t inspire, encourage and motivate you then they might not be the right person for you.
.
• Boundaries are important and need to be respected regardless of how trivial they may seem. .
• Relationships don’t have to last forever to be good relationships. Things change, people change. The end of a relationship is not necessarily a failure. .
• Loving unconditionally is both liberating and terrifying.

563,264,"So, this happened today. I woke up to this random dude asking me to cuddle with him. 
1. ""You should block such people"". I have always blocked and moved on. But think about it, if I block him, he goes ahead and pulls this gross shit on some other girl. Why is men sending you vulgar texts okay? Someone, someday, somewhere, has to teach them that running into women's DMs and talking such bullshit IS NOT OKAY. 
2. ""Report his profile""
Instagram blocks a range of posts but report a fuckboy profile and ""tHiS dOeS nOt vIoLaTe oUr gUiDeLiNeS"". So, no thanks. I gave up on Instagram long ago. 
Lessons learned :
1.  Education ≠ Decency - This is a privileged person, with internet access, privilege of learning in a good school (his English, grammar and vocabulary) and yet being such a douchebag. 
2. Male dominance - If he only needed a sexual favour, he would go away after realising I am not interested. He would not waste time and would instead, try his luck at another profile. What he wanted was to show me that he's the boss, he's the master and I cannot win. He wanted to show me my place. This game of 'you say no and I will keep forcing you' gave him the kick. Harassment is his idea of a lazy Sunday morning. 
3.  The fuckboy psychology - He believed there's nothing wrong with him. ""I am just persuading you"", it was as if he was doing me a favour by harassing me. It was as if I am lucky that he wasn't raping me instead. 
4. No fear of law - Not scared by police at all. And when I showed him that I have registered a complaint with National Women's Commission, his response was - now toh I should definitely harass you. This mentality! I wonder if there's any limit to how low such people can stoop. 
To the men- Imagine someone talking about your body in such a disgusting manner and believing that they own you. Now, imagine living this your entire life 24x7. And this fuckboy here is not a monster sitting in filth. He's around you, he's one of us, one of those guys in your college, one of your colleagues, one of your cousins. Okay? Okay. (Also, I know #NotAllMen and men get raped too. I. Know. Women. Know.) (continued in caption)",notallmen,"|To the women- It's your call if you wanna block them and move on, I respect your decision. But why do we believe that eve teasing, name calling, groping, street harassment, online harassment are petty things that you don't file a complaint against? Why? Why are all such disgusting, horrific things not serious enough to take action about? I know, no one will take us seriously. But let's try? Let's not be silent? Let's make them hear our voice, even if they call it noise. 
I don't know where this will lead. I don't know if he will learn a lesson or just go on to harass another girl. I don't know if this is going to be a threat to my life in future. But I know I did my part. I know no founders of any organisations, I didn't start a hashtag on Twitter, most of it was just to scare him. And yeah, I do work for one organisation that works for gender equality, but I am not start a morcha against him. Nothing of that sort. I don't wanna make noise, I don't wanna scream. I really value my mental peace. But yes, I did my part. I did what I thought I needed to do. I tried my best to make sure that he knows that it's not Okay to treat women like dirt. I tried my best to show him that we won't tolerate this behaviour. 
P. S. I am aware I used a lot of cuss words, I was disrespectful towards him. But guess what? HE FUCKING DESERVED IT. 
What I am regretful about is, that I used a cuss word that objectifies women. I know that's my fault and I regret it. Anger and social conditioning led to it, but I will make sure I take care of this in future.

567,268,"The idea of stochastic terrorism in relation to art
•

As an artist, I don’t know who will be seeing my art - so it is the question of who’s eyes it will hit. Producing the art is the act of firing the arrows. These arrows are fired, in a general direction, at human beings- many arrows will hit people who do nothing wrong, but those arrows will also hit directly into the heart of people who are doing something wrong, and those people will know exactly who they are. So I’m not accusing anyone of anything, but exposing people are ‘perverted’. They won’t be exposed externally, but only to themselves, internally (I relate this back to Maggie Nelson’s ‘Perverted Justice’ extract from The Art of Cruelty). The group of people who are completely detached (and know they are detached) from the specific perversion the piece portrays, can therefore ‘enjoy’ the art, interact wth it, be entertained and amused by it. The piece would aim to tell you about yourself, if you are disturbed or offended, completely disconnected, or shamed deeply.

This is all within the context of an art gallery - on the internet, it is different as it is unregulated, and anyone can see it. This brings me on to look at the circulation of imagery on the internet, where you can divide cases into a spectrum of cruelty or adversity, using the infamous Abu Ghraib pictures as a great example for extreme cruelty, then suggestively pornographic images on a cartoon site on the lesser side of the spectrum. Then there is another context, the shop which sells pornography magazines on the top shelf. 
This ideology is attempting to invert the normal relationship that artists might want to have with their audience. Normally, we’d want people to be heavily engaged, but in this case, the people heavily engaged have the most to lose, and those disengaged are okay, or ’normal’, or mainstream. And I am not in control of what spectators think or interpret the piece as, seeing as my piece is to be some sort of reflection of society.

Most people want to burn body fat (adipose tissue) this is different than using fat as an energy source (for example a high fat low carbohydrate diet will utilise fat as an energy substrate more but if the overall calorie intake exceeds calorie expenditure it will not result in fat/weight loss) a calorie deficit is the only way to burn body fat. Also caffeine will act as a diuretic affecting ADH (anti diuretic hormone) so a loss of water weight has to be considered...high fat diets also do the same as fats are hydro-phobic (repel water) whereas carbohydrates e.g. glycogen is hydrophilic....nutrition is a complex topic but claiming a black coffee will help metabolise more fat is an absurd claim....love your posts btw! 👍 thank god there’s other people out there calling BS on those who deserve it!|@marrkj - Have you seen this?! 😂|True.

Do you  LIVE OR PREFER in a mostly white neighborhood where everyone you live, work and are served by all whites? Do you go months/years without seeing a person of color? Are you actually a white supremacist ? These are the only reasons I could think of now that would completely disregard  and publicly denounce facts about the degradation of human life in the americas.|@homospicious Who gets angry? Roof is a terrorist. The Klan are (or were) terrorists. McVeigh was a terrorist. Who says they are not?|If you haven’t been involved in the courts system or look at the statistics at who is going to jail and who is in control of the court system then how could you be SO SURE that I’m sharing bias information? These are actual statistics the US is government is not ashamed to share with the public, these are public records. Yes the Europeans came here  the America’s but there were over 1k tribes already thriving here that almost got wiped out and this how how #mestizo bloodlines came about.|Also, yes you are very sheltered but I don’t  believe in sheltering Latino, Latina, Chicano, chicanas, #chicanax #latinx youth about getting brainwashed. Please do more research,  please understand that you are  privileged to be born later than previous generations that made many sacrifices for you not to have to deal with what you make in an hour at a job is what Mexicans make in a day in the US!|@f.r.ossty but actually you are not white so the older you start looking, the more likely that the “privilege” you are chasing is a mirage. Be distrful@of that middle class dream, does not apply to us Mexicans. Please research how poc internalize racism, google “whiteness” in a person of color context, esp if you identify as #libertarian. Understand what gentrification is, get familiar with what #juentification is. Understand what #colorism esp among Latinos considering how mixed Latinos are with Africans in the America’s and how Mexicans can be just as shitty to black people as white people its messed up. Because you are Mexican AND young, I’ve taken more time to educate you. I’m Mexican too, from Los Angeles and now in Brooklyn. Screen shot are exchange, save them. I know it’s overwhelming and a lot of info but trust me you will thank me on you wedding night!",22

Tout comme de l'autre côté, le swipe s'est fait à droite uniquement pour le confronter. C'est le genre de microagressions auxquelles les femmes sur les appli sont confrontées tous les jours.

I'll be dressed in black all week because when the rest of SA moves on, they will still hunt us down. Until Cyril makes a statement with regards to our laws, we will never be safe. Until Mr ""Shoot to Kill"" Cele can explain his silence, the body count will continue ro rise.

611,13,"Uyinene, I am so sorry. ⁣
Today I sit here, ashamed, thinking: That could have been me.⁣
⁣
I think sometimes that I am lucky to have escaped rape and assault, and then I think what a thought that is. ⁣
⁣
I - like many of you, like Uyinene probably did- play to the Rules of Rape:⁣
I never walk alone, at night, in unsafe areas. I dress more modestly than I'd like, to avoid attention I don't want. I wear sneakers if I'm walking incase I need to run. I avoid eye contact with strange men instead of confront their catcalls straight on. I wait inside until my Uber has come, and I send my location to someone. But I know there are women out there who have all these things done, and they STILL become yet 'another one'.⁣
⁣
I see #NotAllMen trending; a hashtag filled with women and men who choose to respond to justified anger with offense instead of understanding and action. Instead of asking themselves: why does rape happen?⁣
⁣
We allow it to thrive under myths, thinking it only happens under certain circumstances, to certain women, by 'bad' guys, in dark places. ⁣
Not when running errands and fetching mail at the post office.⁣
Not in public toilets and bright forests. ⁣
Not during the day. ⁣
Not in your own home, by someone you'd never say. ⁣
⁣
We fear :⁣
The resignation when an accused is excused without further investigation. The frustration when a victims statement is called 'an exaggeration' . The silent shame when a story is held in because she mustn't 'make a scene', for fear of blame, and ostracization. ⁣
⁣
When will we stop ignoring, avoiding, #NotAllMen-ing, denying, excusing and justifying - while women in South Africa are dying. ⁣
⁣
Today it might not be me, but tomorrow it could be.

Combien sont celles d’entres vous aujourd’hui qui ne peuvent se joindre à moi en partageant une de leurs histoires personnelles liées à des agressions sexuelles, dans la rue, à l’école, au super marché ou à la salle de sport... Aujourd’hui mais depuis longtemps, je suis fatiguée de me battre au nom de la femme. Pourquoi devons nous nous battre, quotidiennement, pour simplement « être », pour simplement vivre. 
A tous les hommes ici, ceux de mon Instagram, ceux qui vont s’attarder à lire. Éduquez-vous. Éduquez vos srab, ceux avec qui vous plaisantez dans la rue, en charriant « gentillement » une fille qui passe dans la rue sur sa tenue vestimentaire ou son apparence physique. Ça ne nous intéresse pas votre avis sur notre paraître. Non je ne porte pas cette robe pour attirer ton attention. Arrêtez de nous siffler dans la rue, de nous suivre ou de nous insulter si on vous ignore. 
À toutes les femmes, lorsque j’avais 15ans, je me promenais dans la ville avec ma meilleure amie @tolune de l’époque. Elle portait une robe. En croisant un autre groupe de jeune fille de notre âge, elle s’est faite insulter, de pute. A l’époque déjà j’hurlais au scandale sur le jugement que même une femme pouvait porter à une autre femme. Je m’en souviens, j’ai aujourd’hui 23ans.

À toutes les femmes, respectez vous, soutenez-vous. Arrêtez de vous juger entre vous. Nous ne sommes pas des putes, aucune d’entres nous.

613,15,"When a woman (or really, anyone) shares something that’s upset them with you... for example, street harassment - do please try your best to not be a real idiot by following these simple rules. 1.) Listen and accept  2.) Ask questions to see if they even want to talk about it, otherwise - 3.) Don’t #mansplain by derailing the conversation and arguing with them about how they should feel or try to give them advice on how they should react next time or worse - how they misunderstood the entire experience. Or even how, women have hit on you on the street, lol, and you’re not bothered by it 🤦🏾‍♀️ Unless they ask for advice, be quiet. In other words, don’t #gaslight them. 
In conversations like this, your opinion is useless. This is #microaggressions and aims to silence people.
I’m so disappointed in how unaware some well-meaning people are. How prevalent the #notallmen movement is and the real compulsion some men have to defend their fellow man despite the fact that no one is attacking them or even ... #allmen, lol.

⚡️ Est-ce vraiment du sexisme ordinaire ? ⚡️
Oui : Dans ce témoignage est fait une remarque qui contribue à renforcer la culture du viol. Justifier un crime par la question biologique ou vestimentaire, c’est enlever au coupable toute la responsabilité de son acte. De plus, on pense à tord que le désir sexuel masculin est plus intense et plus bavard que le désir sexuel féminin, ce qui est faux : c’est un stéréotype. Le désir sexuel dépend d’un tas de facteurs indépendants de notre sexe, genre ou de la nature des hormones que l’on sécrète explique Alexandra Hubin, docteure en sexologie.

Ça me rappelle une fois, assez récente, où on m'a présenté quelqu'un avec qui j'avais des points communs et affinités et au lieu de se dire qu'on pourrait être pote, nos potes en commun m'ont demandé s'il m'intéressait et si on pourrait pas se pécho.

638,40,"Things I could never tell you:
.
1. The day I told you that I loved you, my mind began a tug of war with my heart. My mind screamed– NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NOT.... Not Again! My heart drummed on the walls of its cage trying to spread out it's wings of love and fly once again. The tug of war left my soul shredded into strands and it's battlecry came out as ""I love you"" and nothing but silence. In that silence that followed were a million heartbeats lost, a thousand caged birds set free and in the clapping of their wings was the dawn of a hope that maybe this time, this love will find a way through, that maybe this time, I'd found a love that stays.
.
2. My life was a labyrinth that brought me back to where I started every time I decided to start again. I didn't have any idea about the whats, whys and hows of my life. You took my hand, placed yours on mine and showed me how we create a picturesque with the black and white pallet of our hearts. I never asked you how's your world so colourful if all our heart knows is black and white. But soon I knew the answer. It was love. It was always love but maybe you never saw it even when it surrounded you, covered you like a blanket keeping your beautiful soul so safe and warm that one couldn't help but fall in love with you. I never told you that I wished you did see this love. (I still do)
.
3. I heard your voice on days when keeping myself calm was the hardest thing to do. Your voice kept telling me, ever so calmly, to breathe, to live a little more before I ran, before I broke once again. I did. Breathing in and breathing out, one heartbeat after another, I lived with a smile that, people said, was full of hope. Maybe it was you. It was always you keeping my breaths running, my heart beating and my love going on for what I thought was forever. I never told you that a voice inside me kept telling me to let you go, until I finally did.

Your smile reminded me of the moon that knows how to shine when no sun is there to keep you warm. Soon, you became my horizon where my sky and my ocean met. I never told you that your pictures reminded me how to rise with the dawn and set with the dusk, but you'd never believed me, did you? You only made me fall deeper for you.
.
5. The day I let you go and you told me that maybe I never loved you, pieces of me fell off like dead skin, parts of my soul shivered in the space emptied when you left and my heart– it cried. It cried an apology for all the times I'd hurt you. It cried out a pain that became a part of me. It cried, ""I still love you. I never lied."" It cried in hope that maybe you'll hear it cry, in hope that maybe you'll see the love I've for you, in hope that maybe you'll tell me you love me and make me stay. You never did. You never did and I cried. So I let you go even if all that'd fill the empty space after you was pain. I let you go even when I knew that I'll never be able to love someone the way I loved you. I let you go even though I loved you. And the thing I'll never tell you is that I still love you. ©Debojit|[Picture from Pinterest]|#feminist #feminism #equality #genderequality #girlswhostandforgirls #notallmen #metoo #metooindia #speakup #bringthechange #strongwomenempowerwomen #men #man #empowerwomen #change #timesup #feministboys #harassment #rapes #abuse #molestation #respectgirls #society #menwillbemen #motivation #encouragement #positivity #quotesforyou #poemsofinstagram|This was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time, you did a beautiful job gif guy. 💓|Wow..that's great..",33

You're find your bf telling you to not hangout with guys from college/class, but isn't he too a guy from college/class?

Men will momentarily come out of the fog to warn their families and loved ones. But this empathy doesn't exceed beyond their circles and thresholds. When it's time to take collective responsibility, it's #notallmen .

But have you ever thought about a person who has not done it who is falsely accused. How does the society treat him? How will his family treat him? Say he is cleared of the accusation.

Og ja der er altid undtagelser og #notallmen og #notallwomen og #notalldinosaurs , men generelt. Vi får mindre i løn, vi laver mere, vi kæmper imod glaslofter og strukturer der er perfekte til at holde os nede, vi udsætte for mere partnervold og slås oftere ihjel, samtidig med det skal vi opfostre de små borgere som lige om lidt skal bære vores samfund videre, men vi må satme ikke opfostre dem alene, nej nej, vi skal have de børn med en mand, ellers er det også forkert, og så skal vi smile og hvis vi er vrede er vi hysteriske, men hvis mænd er vrede så er det simpelthen så super sagligt og i orden, og ingen beder en vred mand smile fordi han så vil se meget sødere ud. Og når vi så klarer os godt eller har gennembrud så skal vi hagles ned. Jeg er to gange blevet beskyldt for at knalde mig til gode stillinger fordi folk simpelthen ikke kan kapere at en kvinde kan være dygtig til noget andet end at være mor. Eller. Det kan hun heller ikke, hvis man skal tro mængden af de tvivlsomme artikler der flyder alle vegne, fyldt med “eksperter”, der har svaret på de 7 dødssynder mødre begår mod deres børn.

Ladies, when you don’t make him earn you, you do him a great disservice. He will feel unworthy. And he will resent you for making him feel unworthy. 
We think to have sex casually makes us equal. But we are unwilling to accept the consequence of setting in motion this sequence of relating. 
We may have an equal right to initiate the act without shame.  But our response will always be out of balance, because the science of our body-mind system says that women cannot relate casually. 
Instead, we use each other.  Women often use men to feel a connection, to prove a point, to get over someone, to self-destruct.  The differences between the system of a man and a woman dictate that we will always lose this game. 
We become upset that he treats us casually.  But all he is doing is responding to how we have treated ourselves.  In reality, we are angry with ourselves for treating the precious gift of our physical, spiritual and emotional presence casually. 
And then we bring this self-loathing to the next man we encounter. 
The change must start with women. “If every woman makes every man so born to respect, respect, respect, then there should be no cruelty, no disorder, no mental cruelty, no crime on this whole planet, the world would be just heaven.” - Yogi Bhajan

657,59,"Some relationship lessons I’ve learnt this year:
.
• You’ll never be ready, but if someone makes you feel alive take the risk.
.
• Deciding what you want for dinner is difficult.
.
• You don’t always have to have a life plan, sometimes you can just let go and trust.
.
• Being decisive is sexy.... even if that’s just deciding what you’re having for dinner.
.
• If somebody doesn’t inspire, encourage and motivate you then they might not be the right person for you.
.
• Boundaries are important and need to be respected regardless of how trivial they may seem. .
• Relationships don’t have to last forever to be good relationships. Things change, people change. The end of a relationship is not necessarily a failure. .
• Loving unconditionally is both liberating and terrifying.

661,63,"So, this happened today. I woke up to this random dude asking me to cuddle with him. 
1. ""You should block such people"". I have always blocked and moved on. But think about it, if I block him, he goes ahead and pulls this gross shit on some other girl. Why is men sending you vulgar texts okay? Someone, someday, somewhere, has to teach them that running into women's DMs and talking such bullshit IS NOT OKAY. 
2. ""Report his profile""
Instagram blocks a range of posts but report a fuckboy profile and ""tHiS dOeS nOt vIoLaTe oUr gUiDeLiNeS"". So, no thanks. I gave up on Instagram long ago. 
Lessons learned :
1.  Education ≠ Decency - This is a privileged person, with internet access, privilege of learning in a good school (his English, grammar and vocabulary) and yet being such a douchebag. 
2. Male dominance - If he only needed a sexual favour, he would go away after realising I am not interested. He would not waste time and would instead, try his luck at another profile. What he wanted was to show me that he's the boss, he's the master and I cannot win. He wanted to show me my place. This game of 'you say no and I will keep forcing you' gave him the kick. Harassment is his idea of a lazy Sunday morning. 
3.  The fuckboy psychology - He believed there's nothing wrong with him. ""I am just persuading you"", it was as if he was doing me a favour by harassing me. It was as if I am lucky that he wasn't raping me instead. 
4. No fear of law - Not scared by police at all. And when I showed him that I have registered a complaint with National Women's Commission, his response was - now toh I should definitely harass you. This mentality! I wonder if there's any limit to how low such people can stoop. 
To the men- Imagine someone talking about your body in such a disgusting manner and believing that they own you. Now, imagine living this your entire life 24x7. And this fuckboy here is not a monster sitting in filth. He's around you, he's one of us, one of those guys in your college, one of your colleagues, one of your cousins. Okay? Okay. (Also, I know #NotAllMen and men get raped too. I. Know. Women. Know.) (continued in caption)",notallmen,"|To the women- It's your call if you wanna block them and move on, I respect your decision. But why do we believe that eve teasing, name calling, groping, street harassment, online harassment are petty things that you don't file a complaint against? Why? Why are all such disgusting, horrific things not serious enough to take action about? I know, no one will take us seriously. But let's try? Let's not be silent? Let's make them hear our voice, even if they call it noise. 
I don't know where this will lead. I don't know if he will learn a lesson or just go on to harass another girl. I don't know if this is going to be a threat to my life in future. But I know I did my part. I know no founders of any organisations, I didn't start a hashtag on Twitter, most of it was just to scare him. And yeah, I do work for one organisation that works for gender equality, but I am not start a morcha against him. Nothing of that sort. I don't wanna make noise, I don't wanna scream. I really value my mental peace. But yes, I did my part. I did what I thought I needed to do. I tried my best to make sure that he knows that it's not Okay to treat women like dirt. I tried my best to show him that we won't tolerate this behaviour. 
P. S. I am aware I used a lot of cuss words, I was disrespectful towards him. But guess what? HE FUCKING DESERVED IT. 
What I am regretful about is, that I used a cuss word that objectifies women. I know that's my fault and I regret it. Anger and social conditioning led to it, but I will make sure I take care of this in future.

It probably comes with the way she was raised and the repressed sexual identity she formed because of it. The social climate where she was brought up was even more close minded than ours so clearly its baffling to consider that it is now ""okay"" to dress a certain way. I try to be considerate when my mom or aunts voice their view on things because I know our postures come from different background. Even if they're opinions are sometimes baffling. I do call bullshit every now and then though.|I think that the reason why really depends on the girl, some girls do act/dress that way because of insecurity. But in any situation, girls shouldn’t be shamed for acting/dressing “slutty”, IF insecurity is the reason, they should be helped to get to a better place, not shamed.|People have different reasons for being sex friendly..Inseccurities play a big role.. Some feel that sex is what  keeps a man, some feel that sex is the only place they have control in, a place  that gives them power.

665,67,"The idea of stochastic terrorism in relation to art
•

As an artist, I don’t know who will be seeing my art - so it is the question of who’s eyes it will hit. Producing the art is the act of firing the arrows. These arrows are fired, in a general direction, at human beings- many arrows will hit people who do nothing wrong, but those arrows will also hit directly into the heart of people who are doing something wrong, and those people will know exactly who they are. So I’m not accusing anyone of anything, but exposing people are ‘perverted’. They won’t be exposed externally, but only to themselves, internally (I relate this back to Maggie Nelson’s ‘Perverted Justice’ extract from The Art of Cruelty). The group of people who are completely detached (and know they are detached) from the specific perversion the piece portrays, can therefore ‘enjoy’ the art, interact wth it, be entertained and amused by it. The piece would aim to tell you about yourself, if you are disturbed or offended, completely disconnected, or shamed deeply.

This is all within the context of an art gallery - on the internet, it is different as it is unregulated, and anyone can see it. This brings me on to look at the circulation of imagery on the internet, where you can divide cases into a spectrum of cruelty or adversity, using the infamous Abu Ghraib pictures as a great example for extreme cruelty, then suggestively pornographic images on a cartoon site on the lesser side of the spectrum. Then there is another context, the shop which sells pornography magazines on the top shelf. 
This ideology is attempting to invert the normal relationship that artists might want to have with their audience. Normally, we’d want people to be heavily engaged, but in this case, the people heavily engaged have the most to lose, and those disengaged are okay, or ’normal’, or mainstream. And I am not in control of what spectators think or interpret the piece as, seeing as my piece is to be some sort of reflection of society.

Most people want to burn body fat (adipose tissue) this is different than using fat as an energy source (for example a high fat low carbohydrate diet will utilise fat as an energy substrate more but if the overall calorie intake exceeds calorie expenditure it will not result in fat/weight loss) a calorie deficit is the only way to burn body fat. Also caffeine will act as a diuretic affecting ADH (anti diuretic hormone) so a loss of water weight has to be considered...high fat diets also do the same as fats are hydro-phobic (repel water) whereas carbohydrates e.g. glycogen is hydrophilic....nutrition is a complex topic but claiming a black coffee will help metabolise more fat is an absurd claim....love your posts btw! 👍 thank god there’s other people out there calling BS on those who deserve it!|@marrkj - Have you seen this?! 😂|True.

Or about women who commit cold-blooded murders on their husbands, in drunken rage. Or about jealous partners who kill ""their men"" in vengeance. Or about female stalkers who kidnapp, rape and murder the object of their affection.

707,109,"[DESLIZAR y leer TODO] Con todas las reacciones divididas por la protesta feminista en #CDMX y en otros estados de la República 🇲🇽 , me llenó de orgullo ver que el apoyo es cada vez más grande, incluso a nivel internacional. 🌎 Sin embargo, hubo otros comentarios que sólo demuestran lo mucho que nos falta para alcanzar la verdadera equidad. Como Twitter suele usarse de manera más anónima que Facebook, me atreví a hacer una encuesta que consideré muy obvia y aun así reveladora: ¿es éste un atuendo que propicie la agresión sexual? ⚠️ (Obvio la foto es mía porque no usaría la de alguna compañera.) Lo bonito: el 93% ✅ de los votos por parte de usuarios que se han empapado más de conciencia. Lo feo: los mensajes que recibí por privado, todos de machos escondiéndose para hacerse los buenos, recargar la responsabilidad de su violencia en nosotras o, de plano, agredir directamente. De ocho, estas tres me parecieron las más representativas (mi cuenta no tiene muchos seguidores, ¿se imaginan si fuese lo contrario?). Dense cuenta de que éstos son algunos de sus amigos, familiares, y hasta novios. ❌ Vigilen bien las conductas de sus relaciones cercanas, y no guarden silencio ante ellas; un onvre que no está dispuesto a aprender probablemente no lo hará nunca. No lo esperen. Reaccionen.

708,110,"For years, through several generations, we've been taught the Art of Shushing.
.
It's her first period: shush! Find a cloth. Don't step outside the house for a week.
.
It's the day he finds out that he's attracted to boys: shush! Don't speak of it. Don't be anything but boyish. Don't you dare bring this shame to the family.
.
It's the S word: shush! No talking about it. No fantasizing either. Until you marry a stranger because then it's perfectly fine.
.
It's the day he was bullied and he cried in front of his dad: shush! Man up. Boys don't cry.
.
It's the day a girl was raped, just like everyday: shush! Don't you know what the society is going to say. It's all your fault.
.
It's the day he stood up for his friend who was called ""gay"" by a group of bullies: shush! Are you gay too?
.
And we shushed. We shushed every voice inside us that wanted to retaliate.
.
But if the youth of a generation that can make robots talk, that can do anything they wish to, can't speak up for their own rights, then it all goes in vain.
.
If we decide to speak up, if we decide to talk about every little flaw in our whole educational system and our upbringing, we can bring about a whole new generation that'll be free of every stereotype, misconception and racial gap.
.
So we must do everything we can to bring about the change that this world needs.
We must because we can.
We must because we can.

712,114,"I know #NotAllMen are rapists!
But does it mean That they're Gentlemen Or does it mean they're just a normal person?
Haven't we heard about #KanganaVsHrithik controversy?
Do we really know every single detail to consider who is the culprit or who is innocent?
Haven't we ourselves gone into discussions or arguments with others to defend our ""role models""? Because Kangana is self made woman, so she is right! Or because Hrithik is brought up sophisticatedly, so he can't be wrong!
Ever wondered how much we idealise our role models that we leave no room in our mind of them being wrong! (I have done this a lot and I am learning from my mistakes now).
Forget celebrities, we idealise our friends, family, partners Etc!
And if ever a complainant tries to expose the reality, we choose to remain delusional and go ""not all men""!
What if we realized that everyone has a dark side that we or even them aren't ready to confront? I'm not talking about Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personalities here. I'm talking about being afraid of knowing the truth, so afraid that we keep wrapping ourselves in the layers of lies to remain comfortable! You know what it does to others who were wronged by our idealised ""role model""? It makes them doubt themselves & they feel guilty, makes them more vulnerable & they feel unsafe, makes them feel like a criminal because the real culprit won't be punished!
You can search online and find out so many cases and understand the impact it has. I recently came to know how #EllenDeGeneres was molested by her mother's partner and her mother didn't believe her for years and stayed in the relationship. Only if she hadn't idealised him so much, her daughter didn't have to go through all the pain.
I'm NOT IMPLYING THAT ALL MEN, though some men do have criminal intents & they are skilled at projecting themselves as a Gentleman to create a charming facade that it's hard to escape & not believe them, I am distinguishing between normal and not normal behavior like not raping doesn't mean you are a gentleman, it just means that you are not a rapist but a guy convincing a girl to be physically intimate when she isn't ready IS harassing, no matter how gently he manipulated her!",notallmen,|#MeToo #MeTooMovement #MeTooStory #MeTooIndia #MeToo,12

Créanme cuando les digo que se ha intentado de todo: Bailan, cantan, se expresan artisticamente: se burlan. Presentan iniciativas de ley, no pasan. 
Crean movimientos separatistas por y para ellas, comienzan los hombres a cuestionar la veracidad de las historias y a querer demeritar lo ocurrido solo porque #NotAllMen 
Denuncian, se hacen trámites larguísimos y totalmente denigrantes para las víctimas y al final en la gran mayoría de los casos, queda impune.
Así que no, yo sé que rayar la Victoria Alada, incendiar el Metrobús no ""son formas"" de protestar y si tuviéramos soluciones para este problema, sé que no lo estarían haciendo. Pero ni siquiera tendríamos por qué estar pidiendo que se nos respete nuestro derecho a caminar tranquilas en las calles, sin el riesgo de ser acosadas, violadas o asesinadas.

I can't be arsed to go out and dance because most times, it means being harrassed and as I get older, my tolerance wears thinner. But alas, we had @sophiecarolinej back for a day & a night so we did it (see cute pic of us being 28 & adorable) . And of course we were harrassed but also seriously threatened as well. Two cars full of men curb crawled us down an entire street. They were originally turning left off the street that we were walking down but decided to reverse and drive along side us. They drove slowly next to us, hollering shit, occasionally swerving the car in our direction and then followed us into a bar. They came in, continued to harrass us and when I told one of them that I don't talk men that go out of their way to scare me, and said repeatedly that we felt scared, he made repeated threats to batter me/knock me out etc. The security in the bar did nothing but shush in the direction of the man. So I did something I never bother to do when men threaten and abuse me and called the police. NOVEL IDEA. lol. Well. Why. Bother.? They arrived, let us know they'd advised the men to stay in the bar, advised us that it would be ""inflammatory"" to return, offered us no assistance in getting home safely and recorded it as a 'Section 4 Public Order' - awww so reassuring. And THEN had the nerve to give my number to victim support. If we are victims, why do you do nothing to protect us? Some of my earliest memories are of violent men wreaking havoc and following up threats like those with my mother's drawn blood and it feels like the reminders will never stop coming.

Wish they were that enthusiastic when it comes to teaching blokes manners and how to treat women.|It’s tempting to call those men animals because it distances them from the rest of us, but truth is that it’s just men. This happens every single damn day all over the world and I wish I had a solution, because calling them out doesn’t work and neither does reporting them it seems. It’s easy to say ‘police your friends’ but the type of guys that do this hang out with other guys that do this. All it takes is for the bouncer to be one of those type of guys (I suspect) and the police too and then you’re just out there with no protection.|Big ups to women like you Maiya 💖💪🏽 it’s hard for us to take a stand in this male dominated world and although it was an awful experience, I couldn’t be prouder of you. The police response was pathetic. And I was also dumbfounded at a victim support text after being told it’s our word against theirs, and no acknowledgement of us being victims...a bit of victim support on the night is preferable to a text days later after they let us walk home alone, whilst the perpetrators continued to enjoy their drinks.

When feminists feel bad for men, it is a fleeting emotion. Fleeting emotions don’t stop fear of walking down the street, sleeping in a room with doors that don’t lock, or making eye contact with the abusive supervisor the management protects. 
When feminists feel bad for men, it is an emotion that precedes rage, blood boiling anger and pain as sharp as needles and desert cactus spines. 
Feminist rage is really feminist love. 
It is love for the small children whose bodies have been abused before they have language. 
It is love for the girls, women, trans, nonbinary, and twospirit individuals we’ve lost, including ourselves. Feminist love is seeing the violence that digital porn produces — a spiraling hellhole into desires and actions that weren’t there to begin with but now are — and begging for sacred sexuality, a return to a future none of us have known.

Eine Frau in Jeans und Shirt läuft auf einer Seitenstraße nachhause. 
Es ist ein sonniger und freundlicher Vormittag und sie fühlt sich wohl mit sich, dem Wetter und dem schönen Tag. 
Ein Auto fährt in Schritttempo neben ihr. 
Zwei Männer sitzen in dem Wagen. ""Guck, das ist eine richtige Frau, die ist geil, die könnten wir einfach einpacken und mitnehmen!"" Es wird laut gelacht und unumwunden wird die Frau angestarrt und taxiert. 
Da läuft diese Frau und fühlt sich auf einmal gar nicht mehr wohl. 
Der Wagen fährt langsam davon und die Frau beschleunigt ihren Schritt, fürchtet sich und fragt sich, ob das richtig ist oder ob sie lieber langsamer und in eine andere Richtung laufen sollte. 
Ich hatte gestern keine Kopfhörer auf. 
Ich war nicht in meiner Musikwelt. 
Ich war nicht sicher. 
Ich habe diese Worte gehört und Angst, Wut und Abscheu empfunden.
Ich habe geschwiegen und getan, als hätte ich diese Worte nicht gehört.
Ich straffte meinen Körper und versuchte, Ruhe zu bewahren. 
Wie oft überhöre und übersehe ich diesen Umgang wohl? 
Werden diese Männer an der nächsten Ecke stehen und mich, die echte Frau, womöglich wirklich ""einpacken""? Was, wenn sie sehen, wo ich wohne? 
Was, wenn mein, zuvor verabschiedeter Begleiter bei mir gewesen wäre? 
Was, wenn das nicht ""nur"" herabwürdigende Worte sind und Taten folgen? 
Kann ich mich zur Wehr setzen, sollten diese Worte zu Taten werden?
Was, wenn ich meinen Lesern abermals davon erzähle und mir einmal mehr irgendjemand mitteilt, ich würde ja übertreiben, diese Erlebnisse irgendwie anziehen, ich solle es mir in der Opferrolle nicht so bequem machen und es wären ja nicht alle so 
Wann hört dieses Angst und schuldig machen endlich auf? 
Der Tag war sonnig. 
Ich war es nicht mehr, womöglich, weil ich eine ""richtige"" Frau bin, es nicht mehr ertrage, so behandelt zu werden und die Furcht vor den Taten nach den Worten real ist.

Another woman has died as a result of male violence. 42 women in Australia so far this year. This is a NATIONWIDE CRISIS a life-threatening problem. We are ALL responsible in demanding change to this toxic culture.
.
We must stop focussing on the behaviour and circumstances of the victims of these crimes and instead talk about the perpetrators. What a woman does for a living. What a woman is wearing. Where a woman is walking. How much a woman has had to drink is IRRELEVANT.
.
We need to start talking about the fundamental issues within our society that consistently lead to violence against women. We need to stop blaming victims and start addressing the deeply rooted sexism that exists here in Australia. Educating men and challenging their attitudes is fundamental. The onus should not be on women to act a certain way to protect themselves.
.
The most recent death was a woman aged 24, she was educated, she enjoyed traveling, she was very much loved by her friends and family, she followed us on Instagram and we had spoken to her a handful of times. I won’t tell you her name, I won’t share her photo because she wasn’t public with her line of work and her job should not take away from the fact that an act of male violence killed this young woman. Sex work is work, she was a woman who died working a job just like anyone else. Rest in peace angel 💕

This hashtag is currently on the run. I can't seem to find it on @Instagram, though the hashtag is much loved by many of its users, or @Amazon, a sales platform that is much hated by many of its users. A sad, sorry situation. Lucky for the world, the hashtag remains operational on @Twitter.

#CherylKahla recently published a user's guide for the hashtag. Here's an excerpt: “#MenAreTrash began trending in #SouthAfrica in 2017 when #KaraboMokoena was murdered by her boyfriend and her body burned. It’s been used by women to highlight the abuse and violence that women experience on a daily basis.
Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.
In short, the ‘men are trash’ hashtag is not about men; it’s about what women experience at the hands of men. It’s a woman’s reality and lived experience, not a man’s. And it’s about raising #awareness.”
Alas, such honest statements are controversial, so they are made to exist under digital #lockdown.

Men who fear feminism and gay men use their own morals as a template.

I've taken a lift home with one of my best guy friends, only for him to stop in an empty field and force me to give him a blowie. I didn't want to be raped, so I did it. It was my first time. I didn't tell anyone, because I didn't think anyone would believe me. 
I've walked home alone, not sure if I'd make it there alive. 
I've been catcalled (even when with my kids). I've had men whistle at me from cars, only to be sworn at if I didn't respond to their ""compliments"". I have sat in a train car while a man masturbated while looking directly at me. 
I've been slapped on the ass while waitressing. 
I've had my drink spiked while out with my girlfriends. I locked myself in the bathroom before everything went black. 
I've had a famous rugby player who is twice my size pick me up against a wall in a club, and grind against me while trying to take my panties off. 
8 years ago, on my birthday, I went out with two girlfriends. I just had my daughter 8 months before, and wanted to feel part of the world again. A man slipped his hand into my dress by the bar and started groping me. I struggled to push him off, everyone could see - no one helped. I slapped him, and he threw me to the ground and swore at me while his friends laughed nervously. I was too afraid to leave the club, I was afraid that he would follow me to my cab. My husband and 8 month old daughter had to come fetch me in town, in the middle of the night. If things took a turn for the worse they would say that it was because I was showing off my cleavage, or because I had no place being in a club as a mother. That I deserved it.  I haven't gone out with friends since.
Womens month is nothing to celebrate. We should be angry.

We also need to be afraid. Fear helps us run. It helps us avoid unsafe situations in the first place. It is a critical survival emotion for human beings to access in healthy, appropriate doses.

820,222,"So the last post gathered a bit of attention on various social media accounts, mostly positive so thank you to those that DO support ending street harassment. (can't believe I have to highlight the fact some people do and some people don't)

For the rest of you who thought cat calling being considered as a hate crime under British Law was a joke I thought I'd share WHY it does need to be taken to a legal matter.

@stellacreasy, Labour MP and women's rights activist has been leading a campaign to end verbal abuse to women, and wants to the action to be classed in the same bracket as religious hate crimes.

Ms Creasy hopes that misogyny will be recognised as a criminal offence - along with other hate-crimes tying into race, disability and other sexual offences.

So what does Cat-calling actually mean? 
Cat calling or wolf-whistling means yelling or whistling at people in a ""sexually suggestive"" way.

Ms Creasy said: ""This isn’t about creating new crimes but recognising as we do with racial and religious hatred when someone is being targeted because of who they are and saying it’s not for them to cope with it, but us all to stop it."" As small as this may seem to others we have to look at the bigger picture. Allowing a culture of sexual harassment continue whether we are just talking about the verbal kind is helping us to raise misogynistic males who see woman as objects and not as humans.We deserve the same respect and to be able to walk down a street without preparing ourselves to put headphones in before we pass the group of lairy builders #NOTALLBUILDERS or feel humiliated as a group of lads walk by saying sexual comments about our body

Where is an inequality between male and female when it comes to sex, because men tend to have fewer relations between 15 and 30 and more after, it's called commonly the 80 20 rule, 80 % of the women matches with 20 % of the men so the 80 % left are dealing with the bottom 20 % less attractive, to get the exemple with Tinder. Women can be more selective when they are younger. So if men are looking for sex more it's because it's harder for them to get it and there is a bigger need because of the hormones. And if the society is now pushing for the sex freedom, for some men a woman who had a lot of sexual relation is not attractive anymore, it's a part of social construct, but also instinct, as woman (i just have the stats for them, I don't know if it's same for men) who had more sexual relations tends to be less happy in their parteneirs choises, and they divorce more ofter.",89

828,230,"Una de mis primeras lecturas de las vacaciones ha sido este ""Ofendiditos"" de Lucía Lijtmaer al que tenía tantas ganas y que me ha durado un viaje en tren. 
Debo reconocer que, quizá por el título o subtítulo, esperaba algo diferente, quizá más concreto. Sin embargo este es un librito lleno de reflexiones interesantes en torno a lo que hoy llaman neopuritanismo, la figura del ""ofendidito"", la del Fiero Analista o la idea de ""corrección política"" (también la de ""incorrección política"", claro). El punto del que la autora parte es claro: ¿De verdad estamos ante una corriente neopuritana y conservadora que censura en nombre de lo políticamente correcto? ¿Y no será que realmente asistimos a una descalificación de la protesta que fija su objetivo en esta minoría de ""ofendiditos"" mientras nos distrae de las verdaderas amenazas para la libertad de expresión?
.
Además de todas las alusiones que Lijtmaer hace a lo largo del libro, a mí este término ""ofendiditos"" me remite directamente al famoso anuncio que Campofrío hizo las pasadas navidades, en el que se exaltaba el humor por encima de todo (y cuando digo de todo, es de todo); venían a decir que en nombre del humor todo vale, y que si te molesta o te disgusta un chiste, eres un ""ofendidito"", una de esas personas que nadie quiere ser porque todos nos las imaginamos como seres grises y amargados, incapaces de disfrutar con nada (no es por nada, pero así las representaba el anuncio de Campofrío; además, curiosamente, la vestimenta de las mujeres ""ofendiditas"" del spot recordaba mucho a la de las sufragistas). El anuncio representaba unos grandes almacenes a los que los humoristas de nuestro país acudían a comprar chistes. Para mí ahí está lo más interesante de todo, en esa idea de ""pagar"" por hacer humor, como si realmente saliera caro hacer chistes sobre mujeres, gitanos, homosexuales o discapacitados, como si todo el humor se pudiese meter en el mismo saco... Ahí estaríamos en otro debate, o quizá no, lo que está claro es que el libro de Lucía Lijtmaer, a pesar de su brevedad, da para mucha reflexión.

El boicot como acto legítimo es primero cuestionado por la derecha -no está de más recordar la demonización de los escraches durante la crisis económica-, y ahora se define como un acto de ""ofendiditos"" y ""puritanas"" por parte de unos Fieros Analistas que dibujan a un público inconsciente, que no sabe lo que se hace, y que, con su infantilismo, acabará infantilizando a los demás. Cuando Black Lives Matter se transforma en Sol Lives Matter. Cuando sucesos históricos como #Cuéntalo o #MeToo, en los que por primera vez las mujeres, en red, cuentan y definen sus abusos, son contestados con un #notallmen, no todos los hombres. Cuando a las conquistas LGTBI se les contrapone una supuesta fragmentación de la izquierda en luchas parciales. Cuando el Fiero Analista pide sensatez ante escraches o manifestaciones, despoja de legitimidad una serie de luchas. Cuando la tacha de queja, niega racionalidad a la protesta. El ofendidito -el quejica, en definitiva- queda reducido a la imagen de una niña pequeña que llora.

Here is what the Police has to say 👇👇👇
.
.
As the story of the gang-rape of a student of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, allegedly by some soldiers, continues to trend, the state police command on Monday said the Nigerian Army had not yet transferred the case to it.

The student was allegedly gang-raped by some soldiers of the 32 Artillery Brigade attached to a checkpoint on the Ikare Akoko-Akungba Akoko Road last week, but the army said it had arrested the suspects, while investigation was ongoing.

Governor Rotimi Akeredolu had earlier called on the army to transfer the case to the police for further investigation and prosecution of the suspects, but the police said the case had not been transferred to them.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Femi Joseph, said the command was awaiting the transfer of the case to it by the brigade.
“As I am speaking with you, we have yet to receive the case from the army, maybe later we will have the case; but for now, there is nothing of such,” Joseph stated.

Meanwhile, the Women for Advancement Group, Ondo State chapter, has warned the Nigerian Army and other stakeholders against sweeping the case under the carpet.
The state coordinator of the group, Mrs. Kemi Kamar, in a statement condemned the alleged act of the soldiers, describing it as barbaric and inhuman.

She stated, “This act is totally bad and it is not expected from the people, whose responsibility is to protect the citizens. The perpetrators should not go unpunished. “In as much as we know that the Nigerian Army is highly discipline and will not tolerate such a wicked act, we want to call on the Chief of Army Staff and other stakeholders to ensure that the randy soldiers are brought to book.

We understand that there may be some influence peddling from the top to kill that matter, but we will not relent in our agitation until the case is finally concluded.”
.
The group also vowed that its members would take to the streets of state capitals in protest if the perpetrators were not prosecuted.",notallmen,"|#notallmen #blacklivesmatter #lesbian #gay #bisexual #transgender #girlpower #blackpower

Entre rage, douleur et colère je l’ai voilement repousser pour aller me blottir contre un pote. Plus tard je l’ai recroiser quand je faisais la file pour les WC avec des copines. Le mec a osé me faire un clin d’œil. Je suis sortie de mes gonds j’ai quitté la file et je me suis placée face à lui en furie totale et je l’ai embrouillé sévère à base de c’est quoi ton problème, tu te prends pour qui, des grands gestes de bras et beaucoup de noms d’oiseaux. Le mec restait la statique avec un sourire en coin. La j’ai vu rouge. Je me suis rapprochée je lui ai balancé mon verre dans la figure et quand il a relevé la tête je lui ai mis une claque. Je voulais le frapper encore et encore. La mes amis sont intervenus en me rattrapant par les bras en me disant qu’il n’en valait pas la peine, que je faisais des histoires pour pas grand chose.
Pas grand chose? Il ne s’agit ni plus ni moins d’une agression. 
Ils m’ont aussi que ses potes se rapprochaient du mec et que ça ne devenait pas très safe.
Bref.
Je ne suis pas quelqu’un de violent d’ordinaire mais j’ai vu rouge d’un coup. Au delà du geste son « t’aime ça toi » résonnait dans ma tête quand il avait ce sourire en coin malsain. 
Il m’a fallu un bon moment pour redescendre de cette haine.

841,243,"If #notallmen directed the energy they spend on trolling feminists into actual action for all the problems they list as arguments against feminism, then perhaps they wouldn’t look like a great big fragile testicle with a mouth. Honestly “THE WAGE GAP ISN’T REAL” “FEMINISM IS CANCER” and argue that “MORE MEN SUFFER FROM HOMELESSNESS” “MALE SUICIDE” yes fellas, and feminism supports these issues as they’re also a result of the awesome patriarchy that you still benefit from.

And making us constantly explain how feminism benefits you also proves what a self entitled broflake you are. Ok I’ll stop ranting about this now, we’ve just had a a large volume of trolling of late.

1) make sure your audience is ok about it. Consent is sexy.
2) try to take a good shoot. Just like portrays, the lights and angle are important. MORE LIGHTS!
3) show no face. Even if you trust the person on the other side of the screen, hackers are everywhere. Be careful.

847,249,"¿Nunca te has parado a analizar la frase ""Yo soy un tío y sé cómo piensan los tíos""?
En principio es porque ven su relación amenazada por alguien de fuera. No es que crean que tu vas a caer en los brazos de cualquiera que se te cruce (que también los hay), sino que creen que el tío que te esta hablando tiene el exclusivo interés de follar contigo.
Pero ¿por qué quiero analizarlo e ir más allá? Porque alguien que dice ""yo soy esto, y sé como piensan los que son esto"", te está diciendo que él es esa cosa y es por eso que la distingue con facilidad (acierte o no). Te está diciendo que él es un tío que también habla con tias porque le interesa tener sexo con ellas. ¿Cuál es el problema, además del evidente machismo de este chico? Que ese machismo solo le molesta cuando le afecta directamente. Porque cuando él era del grupo de solteros, era el primero que enseñaba nuestras fotos de whatsapp a los colegas compartiendo opiniones como que la de la foto es una guarra (incluso hablaban de pasársela unos a otros, total solo sirve para follar) pero ahora que tiene pareja, considera que esa novia merece un poquito más de respeto que antes, dado que ahora, según él, ella le pertenece. Ahí si le molesta que otro tío sea como él ha sido siempre, con su novia (hermano ya está cogida, búscate a otra, ¿no?). Es literal: cuando ellos son los solteros ninguno se interesa por si lo que está haciendo está mal o no. Sin embargo, cuando toca que un tío se comporte así con su actual novia, son los primeros que critican ese comportamiento y lo tachan de machista. 
Las pocas ocasiones que nos damos cuenta del sentido que tiene esta frase y preguntamos al tipo si no está viendo que se acusa a sí mismo, tiene la poca decencia de decir que él no es de esos. Osea, que mete a todo el mundo en el mismo saco excepto a él (de repente es un amorcito el machote). Admite que un comportamiento es muy machista, pero no admite que él es igual porque ahora tiene pareja y sabe que está mal (es consciente de que para mantener una mujer consigo hay que demostrarle que tiene un interés más allá del sexo, sabe que no somos estúpidas). •Sigo abajo, lo subiré a las stories también•",notallmen,"|¿De verdad que nadie ve el fallo en que solo quiera que te sientas ""respetada"" cuando-para él- ya eres de su propiedad? ¿por qué nos seguimos ilusionando cuando nos habla de respeto si en realidad el no querer que nos relacionemos con otros tíos es una muestra de que no nos respeta nada? ¿No es EVIDENTE que nos culpa a nosotras de que los tíos no sepan tratarnos como a PERSONAS? 
Mi consejo: cualquier tío que te diga esa frase, CUALQUIERA, no merece estar en tu vida. Échalo, fuera. Te está diciendo con todas las letras la clase de tío que es, bajo un disfraz de hombre ejemplo. Lo más triste es que suelen conseguir que te lo creas, y por desgracia sigues esperando a que cambie, estás atrapada en esa gran mentira. Te lo digo así de claro, es una mentira. Los hombres así son muy peligrosos, y ninguno va a cambiar. No te nolestes en pensar que el tuyo sí porque tú vas a ser la más paciente del mundo y lo ayudarás a ser mejor persona porque pierdes tu valioso tiempo. 
EL PROBLEMA DE UN INSEGURO E INFELIZ MACHISTA DE MIERDA, ES SUYO, NO TUYO. 
Sé por mi propia experiencia que a cada persona le lleva su tiempo, incluso a algunas las dejan antes de dejar ellas (jodienda, porque encima de fracasar intentando ayudar al inútil de mierda este, y de hundirte en la miseria, no pudiste ver la realidad a tiempo pa dejarlo tú), pero también se que aunque lleves toda la vida con esa persona, intentándolo a muerte... si duele, no es amor. El dolor que sea, aunque hoy parezca que ya ha cambiado montón y duela menos que el año pasado cuando empezaste con él (te has acostumbrado) no es amor, y punto. Y lo tenemos que entender de una puta vez. 
Pd: si eres de esta clase de tíos vete a terapia, o quítate de en medio, que estorbas, y mucho. Y déjate de #notallmen que bien sabemos que lo usas pa lo que te sale de los huevos.

869,271,"Does it make you uncomfortable that I have posted my b(o)(o)b on the interwebs?... I encourage you to ask yourself why.

What about this picture makes you feel bothered? 
Is it the amount of human flesh that is showing? 
Is it the fact that my child is no longer a small baby? 
Is it the crystals that R has delicately placed on me? 
Is it breastfeeding in general?

I mean, I don't honestly care 🤷‍♀️... .

But there are so many projections and stories that society STILL tells us about female breasts. If a woman is selling you beer with this much breast showing... cool cool cool. SEXY. Let's buy a slab and not think twice about the objectification of the female form to sell to the male demographic. .

See a woman feeding her toddler from her breast... cue the internalized misogyny from women who buy into sexualization of our own life-giving bodies, and of course, men feeling confronted that the body part they like to *!&#* off to has a child attached to it. (Dont worry, I know... #notallmen 🤦‍♀️) .

I surround myself with plenty of women and men and nonbinary individuals who are totally supportive and knowledgeable about the benefits of breastfeeding. And who love my conviction and the joy it brings myself and my bub.... I couldn't feel any less shame around this. But that is not the case for many many people out there.

So in honour of #worldbreastfeedingweek I will continue my mission to normalize [full term] breastfeeding.

871,273,"Technique de défense qui en fait ne devrait même pas avoir à exister. 
On parle ici de consentement. Ce n’est pas parce qu’on s’éclate seule sur la piste de danse que l’on a envie que le premier mec venu vienne se coller à nous dans notre dos!
Même dans les grandes batailles épique attaquer de dos est une preuve de lâcheté, est-ce vraiment différent sur une piste de danse?
Se faire coller dans le dos est insupportable, on ne voit pas le visage de l’autre et par conséquent on ne peut pas donner (ou pas) notre consentement. 
Cette technique nous rappelle le monde animal (certes nous sommes des animaux mais nous sommes doté-e-s de la capacité de dire « non ») quand le mâle vient choper la femelle par derrière sans attendre un enventuel consentement.
J’abhorre cette technique elle me fait uniquement me sentir comme un bout de viande.
Je ne la comprend pas non plus, jamais il me viendrai à l’esprit de venir me coller dans le dos d’une personne afin de montrer mon intérêt. 
L’approche frontale permet d’offrir un jugement libre et éclairer à l’autre.
Certes elle peut être synonyme d’un rejet eventuel mais ethniquement un rejet vaut largement plus qu’une approche non consentie.
Et je ne parlerai même pas ici des attouchement abusifs lié à cette technique. L’autre dans notre dos se permet bien souvent de nous « tâter » comme un vulgaire morceau de chair fraîche. 
Donc pour parer tout ça la technique de la danse « câlin » avec une copine permettait de freiner leurs ardeurs. 
C’est tout de même triste de devoir rester à l’affût de tou-te-s afin de guetter et de mettre en place cette technique. 
Heureusement la sonorité est la. 💪♥️

873,275,I tried to come up with a caption but honestly this post has already perfectly expressed my feelings about #notallmen Posted @withrepost • @proequalrights #eyerollsohard #sohelpful #yesallwomen #feminism #equality,notallmen,"|I see this post alot and I don't get how people don't see the flawed logic. When we say ""not all men"", we're not saying ""all men aren't"". Yes some guys are predators, rapists, abusers, and so are some women. However some people have a strange tendancy to generalise and associate men with these people. There's nothing harmful about saying not all men|To me, #notallmen is almost always used to try and diffuse conversations around the violence faced by women in a society that has historically been set up to justify and allow such abuses to occur. And the thing is, the men who truly ARE “not those men” don’t need defending. They are out there, walking around, happily not raping women and not harassing them or calling them sluts and whores for wearing short skirts, etc. That’s great. But that is literally the bare minimum for being decent human beings. Not raping someone just because he or she is too drunk to say no is like not murdering someone just because they you can. You don’t get prizes for that. I’m not a murderer, and that doesn’t make me special, it just makes me basically decent. So when women say they don’t feel safe around “men”, instead of needing to specify “not ALL men tho”, realize that they don’t mean ALL MEN. And when you lead with that argument, ask yourself why you can’t say “that really sucks; is there something I could be doing to help women feel safer around me?” And if you don’t want to do that, just say “that must suck, I’m sorry you feel that way.” Because asking them to pause and make sure you feel ok with the convo, is part of why women don’t trust men. We don’t feel seen. We don’t feel believed. We want some fucking food and we are prepared to pay for it but the waiter won’t bring us our order AND ALL ANYONE ELSE CARES ABOUT IS JUSTIFYING THEIR OWN FULL PLATES. Women are bloody hangry for this shit to change.",31

es überrascht mich immer wieder, wie vielen übergriffigen männern man an einem abend begegnen kann. begonnen hats mit einem unspektakulären hinterngrapscher bei @lisapros und mir - vom selben typen, der nicht ansprechbar war, als wir ihn zur rede stellen wollte. ungute situation, aber haben wir frauen* doch alle schon mal erlebt oder? als ob das noch nicht gereicht hätte, kommt während einer tanzpause ein anderer mann zu uns, fragt lisa, ob sie mit ihm tanzen will und als sie ihn abweist, wendet er sich an unsere männliche begleitung und bittet um sein einverständnis (weil frauen sind ja keine selbstbestimmten wesen - hab ich vergessen). aber wartet, das beste kommt erst noch! wir waren wieder draußen, um der stickigen luft auf der tanzfläche zu entkommen und - überraschung! - es kommt ein 3. typ vorbei, will sich zwischen meine schwester und mich drängen und als ich sage, dass kein platz für ihn ist, argumentiert er damit, dass österreich ein freies land ist und versucht es weiter. als wir ihm sagen, er soll weggehen und uns in ruhe lassen, wird er frustriert, spuckt mich an (so geil!) und geht. ich war selten in einer situation so perplex und angewidert wie in dieser. das war generell ein abend erster male für mich. in der clubumgebung, in der ich mich aufhalte, (mir zumindest) sowas noch nie passiert ist. aber he, wir wissen eh: #notallmen und feminismus ist sowieso längst überholt!

I will not succumb to this pornographic pedophilic standard of existence set for my people by those who have hate in their hearts for us. Their hearts may be hardened by their endless war against us, but so is our fighting spirit. Our consciousness has been steadily rising from the pitfalls of hell, since the 60s and 70s. Men have a tendency to drift towards degeneracy, and have the audacity to project their deviancy on us. Projection: the act of blaming others for that which you yourself have done. This is what men do. #NotAllMen of course, but those in power set the rules, and their minion handmaidens stand by them at all costs, such as #KILLARY Clinton, who works against the interests of our people so she could eat the crumbs off her husband's table. Every woman and girl has a story to tell, about how some man somewhere, or even a woman suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, relinquished her status to a plaything for men, telling her that everything she was doing for herself was done for the sake of some bloke somewhere, diminishing her worth, abilities and talents, and adjusting her back into mental slavery and physical restrainment, according to what some elite men sitting at a round table somewhere thought was appropriate for her. Sometimes it is her own mother who participated in male supremacy and carried that down to her. Sometimes it is a girl's own mother who restrains her, who makes the work of our ancestors out to be done in vain. And that is the hardest thing to hear. Our own people have grown to resent each other and tear each other down. Generations of women work against each other. It's not always ""them"" that's killing us, sometimes it's ""us"" that's killing us. I will not rip myself apart, and I will engage in radical self-care, in hopes of fostering radical self-love.

885,287,"Well most men.

The amount of times I have heard “feminism is man hating” or “not all men are bad”. Yes we understand that “not all men” are rapists, sexual assaulters, pedophiles, ass grabbers or wolf whistlers. Do you really think we believe that all 3.8 billion of you in the world are gross? But some of you are. And that is enough.

We need you with us not against us. We need you fighting the ‘some’ rather than defending the ‘not all’. Because if you stand by and let it happen you’re just as bad. There are amazing men out there, I’ve seen them, I’ve met them, I’ve dated them. I can honestly say I love men. But not all men (😏). Not the men that have created systematic and social sexism that lies within plain sight. Not the men that banned abortion in America. Not the sexual abusers and the over-aged over-privileged white-assed politicians. And not the men that don’t say anything.

887,289,"Manche Männer heißen Thomas. Nicht alle Männer heißen Thomas. Es gibt Männer, die Thomas heißen, aber das sind nicht alle. Die Menge aller Menschen die Thomas heißen und die Menge aller Männer haben einen Schnitt, aber es sind nicht die gleichen Mengen. Ich kenne einen Mann, der Thomas heißt. Aber nur weil ich einen Mann kenne, der Thomas heißt, heißt das nicht, dass du auch einen Mann kennst, der Thomas heißt. Das heißt auch nicht, dass alle Männer, die ich kenne, Thomas heißen. Das heißt nur, dass ich einen Mann kenne, der so heißt, aber nicht alle Männer heißen Thomas. Es kann auch sein, dass es Frauen gibt, die Thomas heißen. Ich weiß das nicht sicher, aber ausschließen kann man's nicht. Und fangen wir gar nicht erst an von Frauen, die Thomasine heißen. Gibt es nämlich auch! Und Thomasina. Und Tomasa. Da gibt es auch auf jeden Fall Frauen, die so heißen. Selbst wenn eine Frau vllt. nicht direkt Thomas heißt, dann kann sie ja trotzdem Thomasine heißen. Das kann man nicht ausschließen. Und es gibt auch Flüchtlinge, die Thomas heißen. Also vermutlich nicht so viele und ich weiß das auch nicht sicher, aber gibt es bestimmt auch. Wenn nicht so viele Flüchtlinge hier wären, dann wäre der prozentuale Anteil der Männer, die Thomas heißen, bestimmt höher. Aber ich wollte eigentlich einfach nur sagen, dass es da diesen Mann gibt, den ich kenne, der Thomas heißt. Ich selbst kenne nur einen. Klar, es gibt wahrscheinlich noch mehr Männer, die Thomas heißen. Aber nicht alle Männer heißen so! Und das ist ja eigentlich die Hauptsache! Gut, dass wir das geklärt haben!

Mein Punkt ist: Ich führe solche Diskussionen nicht. Weil sie sind immer gleich. Und man kann nicht immer alle Eventualitäten mit erklären. Vor allem nicht hier. Ein Post darf höchstens 2200 Zeichen haben. Wenn ich sage: ""manche"" oder ""nicht alle"", dann meine ich nicht alle und schreib das nicht nach jeder Zeile nochmal. Und andere Themen sind halt andere Themen und es geht nicht immer um alles.

Where is an inequality between male and female when it comes to sex, because men tend to have fewer relations between 15 and 30 and more after, it's called commonly the 80 20 rule, 80 % of the women matches with 20 % of the men so the 80 % left are dealing with the bottom 20 % less attractive, to get the exemple with Tinder. Women can be more selective when they are younger. So if men are looking for sex more it's because it's harder for them to get it and there is a bigger need because of the hormones. And if the society is now pushing for the sex freedom, for some men a woman who had a lot of sexual relation is not attractive anymore, it's a part of social construct, but also instinct, as woman (i just have the stats for them, I don't know if it's same for men) who had more sexual relations tends to be less happy in their parteneirs choises, and they divorce more ofter.",89

904,7,"Una de mis primeras lecturas de las vacaciones ha sido este ""Ofendiditos"" de Lucía Lijtmaer al que tenía tantas ganas y que me ha durado un viaje en tren. 
Debo reconocer que, quizá por el título o subtítulo, esperaba algo diferente, quizá más concreto. Sin embargo este es un librito lleno de reflexiones interesantes en torno a lo que hoy llaman neopuritanismo, la figura del ""ofendidito"", la del Fiero Analista o la idea de ""corrección política"" (también la de ""incorrección política"", claro). El punto del que la autora parte es claro: ¿De verdad estamos ante una corriente neopuritana y conservadora que censura en nombre de lo políticamente correcto? ¿Y no será que realmente asistimos a una descalificación de la protesta que fija su objetivo en esta minoría de ""ofendiditos"" mientras nos distrae de las verdaderas amenazas para la libertad de expresión?
.
Además de todas las alusiones que Lijtmaer hace a lo largo del libro, a mí este término ""ofendiditos"" me remite directamente al famoso anuncio que Campofrío hizo las pasadas navidades, en el que se exaltaba el humor por encima de todo (y cuando digo de todo, es de todo); venían a decir que en nombre del humor todo vale, y que si te molesta o te disgusta un chiste, eres un ""ofendidito"", una de esas personas que nadie quiere ser porque todos nos las imaginamos como seres grises y amargados, incapaces de disfrutar con nada (no es por nada, pero así las representaba el anuncio de Campofrío; además, curiosamente, la vestimenta de las mujeres ""ofendiditas"" del spot recordaba mucho a la de las sufragistas). El anuncio representaba unos grandes almacenes a los que los humoristas de nuestro país acudían a comprar chistes. Para mí ahí está lo más interesante de todo, en esa idea de ""pagar"" por hacer humor, como si realmente saliera caro hacer chistes sobre mujeres, gitanos, homosexuales o discapacitados, como si todo el humor se pudiese meter en el mismo saco... Ahí estaríamos en otro debate, o quizá no, lo que está claro es que el libro de Lucía Lijtmaer, a pesar de su brevedad, da para mucha reflexión.

El boicot como acto legítimo es primero cuestionado por la derecha -no está de más recordar la demonización de los escraches durante la crisis económica-, y ahora se define como un acto de ""ofendiditos"" y ""puritanas"" por parte de unos Fieros Analistas que dibujan a un público inconsciente, que no sabe lo que se hace, y que, con su infantilismo, acabará infantilizando a los demás. Cuando Black Lives Matter se transforma en Sol Lives Matter. Cuando sucesos históricos como #Cuéntalo o #MeToo, en los que por primera vez las mujeres, en red, cuentan y definen sus abusos, son contestados con un #notallmen, no todos los hombres. Cuando a las conquistas LGTBI se les contrapone una supuesta fragmentación de la izquierda en luchas parciales. Cuando el Fiero Analista pide sensatez ante escraches o manifestaciones, despoja de legitimidad una serie de luchas. Cuando la tacha de queja, niega racionalidad a la protesta. El ofendidito -el quejica, en definitiva- queda reducido a la imagen de una niña pequeña que llora. Y no hay nada peor que una niña pequeña que llora"".|@matilla85 igual te interesa 😘|¡Le tengo muchas ganas a esta obra! 😍|Me lo apunto!

Here is what the Police has to say 👇👇👇
.
.
As the story of the gang-rape of a student of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, allegedly by some soldiers, continues to trend, the state police command on Monday said the Nigerian Army had not yet transferred the case to it.

The student was allegedly gang-raped by some soldiers of the 32 Artillery Brigade attached to a checkpoint on the Ikare Akoko-Akungba Akoko Road last week, but the army said it had arrested the suspects, while investigation was ongoing.

Governor Rotimi Akeredolu had earlier called on the army to transfer the case to the police for further investigation and prosecution of the suspects, but the police said the case had not been transferred to them.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Femi Joseph, said the command was awaiting the transfer of the case to it by the brigade.
“As I am speaking with you, we have yet to receive the case from the army, maybe later we will have the case; but for now, there is nothing of such,” Joseph stated.

Meanwhile, the Women for Advancement Group, Ondo State chapter, has warned the Nigerian Army and other stakeholders against sweeping the case under the carpet.
The state coordinator of the group, Mrs. Kemi Kamar, in a statement condemned the alleged act of the soldiers, describing it as barbaric and inhuman.

She stated, “This act is totally bad and it is not expected from the people, whose responsibility is to protect the citizens. The perpetrators should not go unpunished. “In as much as we know that the Nigerian Army is highly discipline and will not tolerate such a wicked act, we want to call on the Chief of Army Staff and other stakeholders to ensure that the randy soldiers are brought to book.

We understand that there may be some influence peddling from the top to kill that matter, but we will not relent in our agitation until the case is finally concluded.”
.
The group also vowed that its members would take to the streets of state capitals in protest if the perpetrators were not prosecuted.",notallmen,"|#notallmen #blacklivesmatter #lesbian #gay #bisexual #transgender #girlpower #blackpower

J’ai déjà parlé des colleurs dans le dos en boîte de nuit. Ici au delà du colleur qui habituellement saisi par la taille, la m’agripper les fesses 1) il m’a fait mal, et 2) ça a remonté ma robe exposant largement mon anatomie en public. Entre rage, douleur et colère je l’ai voilement repousser pour aller me blottir contre un pote. Plus tard je l’ai recroiser quand je faisais la file pour les WC avec des copines. Le mec a osé me faire un clin d’œil. Je suis sortie de mes gonds j’ai quitté la file et je me suis placée face à lui en furie totale et je l’ai embrouillé sévère à base de c’est quoi ton problème, tu te prends pour qui, des grands gestes de bras et beaucoup de noms d’oiseaux. Le mec restait la statique avec un sourire en coin. La j’ai vu rouge. Je me suis rapprochée je lui ai balancé mon verre dans la figure et quand il a relevé la tête je lui ai mis une claque. Je voulais le frapper encore et encore. La mes amis sont intervenus en me rattrapant par les bras en me disant qu’il n’en valait pas la peine, que je faisais des histoires pour pas grand chose.
Pas grand chose? Il ne s’agit ni plus ni moins d’une agression. 
Ils m’ont aussi que ses potes se rapprochaient du mec et que ça ne devenait pas très safe.
Bref.
Je ne suis pas quelqu’un de violent d’ordinaire mais j’ai vu rouge d’un coup. Au delà du geste son « t’aime ça toi » résonnait dans ma tête quand il avait ce sourire en coin malsain. 
Il m’a fallu un bon moment pour redescendre de cette haine.

923,26,"¿Nunca te has parado a analizar la frase ""Yo soy un tío y sé cómo piensan los tíos""?
En principio es porque ven su relación amenazada por alguien de fuera. No es que crean que tu vas a caer en los brazos de cualquiera que se te cruce (que también los hay), sino que creen que el tío que te esta hablando tiene el exclusivo interés de follar contigo.
Pero ¿por qué quiero analizarlo e ir más allá? Porque alguien que dice ""yo soy esto, y sé como piensan los que son esto"", te está diciendo que él es esa cosa y es por eso que la distingue con facilidad (acierte o no). Te está diciendo que él es un tío que también habla con tias porque le interesa tener sexo con ellas. ¿Cuál es el problema, además del evidente machismo de este chico? Que ese machismo solo le molesta cuando le afecta directamente. Porque cuando él era del grupo de solteros, era el primero que enseñaba nuestras fotos de whatsapp a los colegas compartiendo opiniones como que la de la foto es una guarra (incluso hablaban de pasársela unos a otros, total solo sirve para follar) pero ahora que tiene pareja, considera que esa novia merece un poquito más de respeto que antes, dado que ahora, según él, ella le pertenece. Ahí si le molesta que otro tío sea como él ha sido siempre, con su novia (hermano ya está cogida, búscate a otra, ¿no?). Es literal: cuando ellos son los solteros ninguno se interesa por si lo que está haciendo está mal o no. Sin embargo, cuando toca que un tío se comporte así con su actual novia, son los primeros que critican ese comportamiento y lo tachan de machista. 
Las pocas ocasiones que nos damos cuenta del sentido que tiene esta frase y preguntamos al tipo si no está viendo que se acusa a sí mismo, tiene la poca decencia de decir que él no es de esos. Osea, que mete a todo el mundo en el mismo saco excepto a él (de repente es un amorcito el machote). Admite que un comportamiento es muy machista, pero no admite que él es igual porque ahora tiene pareja y sabe que está mal (es consciente de que para mantener una mujer consigo hay que demostrarle que tiene un interés más allá del sexo, sabe que no somos estúpidas). •Sigo abajo, lo subiré a las stories también•",notallmen,"|¿De verdad que nadie ve el fallo en que solo quiera que te sientas ""respetada"" cuando-para él- ya eres de su propiedad? ¿por qué nos seguimos ilusionando cuando nos habla de respeto si en realidad el no querer que nos relacionemos con otros tíos es una muestra de que no nos respeta nada? ¿No es EVIDENTE que nos culpa a nosotras de que los tíos no sepan tratarnos como a PERSONAS? 
Mi consejo: cualquier tío que te diga esa frase, CUALQUIERA, no merece estar en tu vida. Échalo, fuera. Te está diciendo con todas las letras la clase de tío que es, bajo un disfraz de hombre ejemplo. Lo más triste es que suelen conseguir que te lo creas, y por desgracia sigues esperando a que cambie, estás atrapada en esa gran mentira. Te lo digo así de claro, es una mentira. Los hombres así son muy peligrosos, y ninguno va a cambiar. No te nolestes en pensar que el tuyo sí porque tú vas a ser la más paciente del mundo y lo ayudarás a ser mejor persona porque pierdes tu valioso tiempo. 
EL PROBLEMA DE UN INSEGURO E INFELIZ MACHISTA DE MIERDA, ES SUYO, NO TUYO. 
Sé por mi propia experiencia que a cada persona le lleva su tiempo, incluso a algunas las dejan antes de dejar ellas (jodienda, porque encima de fracasar intentando ayudar al inútil de mierda este, y de hundirte en la miseria, no pudiste ver la realidad a tiempo pa dejarlo tú), pero también se que aunque lleves toda la vida con esa persona, intentándolo a muerte... si duele, no es amor. El dolor que sea, aunque hoy parezca que ya ha cambiado montón y duela menos que el año pasado cuando empezaste con él (te has acostumbrado) no es amor, y punto. Y lo tenemos que entender de una puta vez. 
Pd: si eres de esta clase de tíos vete a terapia, o quítate de en medio, que estorbas, y mucho. Y déjate de #notallmen que bien sabemos que lo usas pa lo que te sale de los huevos.

What about this picture makes you feel bothered? 
Is it the amount of human flesh that is showing? 
Is it the fact that my child is no longer a small baby? 
Is it the crystals that R has delicately placed on me? 
Is it breastfeeding in general?

I mean, I don't honestly care 🤷‍♀️... .

But there are so many projections and stories that society STILL tells us about female breasts. If a woman is selling you beer with this much breast showing... cool cool cool. SEXY. Let's buy a slab and not think twice about the objectification of the female form to sell to the male demographic. .

See a woman feeding her toddler from her breast... cue the internalized misogyny from women who buy into sexualization of our own life-giving bodies, and of course, men feeling confronted that the body part they like to *!&#* off to has a child attached to it. (Dont worry, I know... #notallmen 🤦‍♀️) .

I surround myself with plenty of women and men and nonbinary individuals who are totally supportive and knowledgeable about the benefits of breastfeeding. And who love my conviction and the joy it brings myself and my bub.... I couldn't feel any less shame around this. But that is not the case for many many people out there.

So in honour of #worldbreastfeedingweek I will continue my mission to normalize [full term] breastfeeding.

On parle ici de consentement. Ce n’est pas parce qu’on s’éclate seule sur la piste de danse que l’on a envie que le premier mec venu vienne se coller à nous dans notre dos!
Même dans les grandes batailles épique attaquer de dos est une preuve de lâcheté, est-ce vraiment différent sur une piste de danse?
Se faire coller dans le dos est insupportable, on ne voit pas le visage de l’autre et par conséquent on ne peut pas donner (ou pas) notre consentement. 
Cette technique nous rappelle le monde animal (certes nous sommes des animaux mais nous sommes doté-e-s de la capacité de dire « non ») quand le mâle vient choper la femelle par derrière sans attendre un enventuel consentement.
J’abhorre cette technique elle me fait uniquement me sentir comme un bout de viande.
Je ne la comprend pas non plus, jamais il me viendrai à l’esprit de venir me coller dans le dos d’une personne afin de montrer mon intérêt. 
L’approche frontale permet d’offrir un jugement libre et éclairer à l’autre.
Certes elle peut être synonyme d’un rejet eventuel mais ethniquement un rejet vaut largement plus qu’une approche non consentie.
Et je ne parlerai même pas ici des attouchement abusifs lié à cette technique. L’autre dans notre dos se permet bien souvent de nous « tâter » comme un vulgaire morceau de chair fraîche. 
Donc pour parer tout ça la technique de la danse « câlin » avec une copine permettait de freiner leurs ardeurs.

949,52,I tried to come up with a caption but honestly this post has already perfectly expressed my feelings about #notallmen Posted @withrepost • @proequalrights #eyerollsohard #sohelpful #yesallwomen #feminism #equality,notallmen,"|I see this post alot and I don't get how people don't see the flawed logic. When we say ""not all men"", we're not saying ""all men aren't"". Yes some guys are predators, rapists, abusers, and so are some women. However some people have a strange tendancy to generalise and associate men with these people. There's nothing harmful about saying not all men|To me, #notallmen is almost always used to try and diffuse conversations around the violence faced by women in a society that has historically been set up to justify and allow such abuses to occur. And the thing is, the men who truly ARE “not those men” don’t need defending. They are out there, walking around, happily not raping women and not harassing them or calling them sluts and whores for wearing short skirts, etc. That’s great. But that is literally the bare minimum for being decent human beings. Not raping someone just because he or she is too drunk to say no is like not murdering someone just because they you can. You don’t get prizes for that. I’m not a murderer, and that doesn’t make me special, it just makes me basically decent. So when women say they don’t feel safe around “men”, instead of needing to specify “not ALL men tho”, realize that they don’t mean ALL MEN. And when you lead with that argument, ask yourself why you can’t say “that really sucks; is there something I could be doing to help women feel safer around me?” And if you don’t want to do that, just say “that must suck, I’m sorry you feel that way.” Because asking them to pause and make sure you feel ok with the convo, is part of why women don’t trust men. We don’t feel seen. We don’t feel believed. We want some fucking food and we are prepared to pay for it but the waiter won’t bring us our order AND ALL ANYONE ELSE CARES ABOUT IS JUSTIFYING THEIR OWN FULL PLATES. Women are bloody hangry for this shit to change.",31

I will not succumb to this pornographic pedophilic standard of existence set for my people by those who have hate in their hearts for us. Their hearts may be hardened by their endless war against us, but so is our fighting spirit. Our consciousness has been steadily rising from the pitfalls of hell, since the 60s and 70s. Men have a tendency to drift towards degeneracy, and have the audacity to project their deviancy on us. Projection: the act of blaming others for that which you yourself have done. This is what men do. #NotAllMen of course, but those in power set the rules, and their minion handmaidens stand by them at all costs, such as #KILLARY Clinton, who works against the interests of our people so she could eat the crumbs off her husband's table. Every woman and girl has a story to tell, about how some man somewhere, or even a woman suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, relinquished her status to a plaything for men, telling her that everything she was doing for herself was done for the sake of some bloke somewhere, diminishing her worth, abilities and talents, and adjusting her back into mental slavery and physical restrainment, according to what some elite men sitting at a round table somewhere thought was appropriate for her. Sometimes it is her own mother who participated in male supremacy and carried that down to her. Sometimes it is a girl's own mother who restrains her, who makes the work of our ancestors out to be done in vain. And that is the hardest thing to hear. Our own people have grown to resent each other and tear each other down. Generations of women work against each other. It's not always ""them"" that's killing us, sometimes it's ""us"" that's killing us. I will not rip myself apart, and I will engage in radical self-care, in hopes of fostering radical self-love. All women everywhere, at all times, in all places are my sisters and my people. I will not relinquish that sense of belonging and trade it in for ""national Identity"" (CONTD⬇️)",notallmen,"|No nation on earth cares for us, all are ruled by men, and when they want revenge, they use our bodies to get it.

Die Menge aller Menschen die Thomas heißen und die Menge aller Männer haben einen Schnitt, aber es sind nicht die gleichen Mengen. Ich kenne einen Mann, der Thomas heißt. Aber nur weil ich einen Mann kenne, der Thomas heißt, heißt das nicht, dass du auch einen Mann kennst, der Thomas heißt. Das heißt auch nicht, dass alle Männer, die ich kenne, Thomas heißen. Das heißt nur, dass ich einen Mann kenne, der so heißt, aber nicht alle Männer heißen Thomas. Es kann auch sein, dass es Frauen gibt, die Thomas heißen. Ich weiß das nicht sicher, aber ausschließen kann man's nicht. Und fangen wir gar nicht erst an von Frauen, die Thomasine heißen. Gibt es nämlich auch! Und Thomasina. Und Tomasa. Da gibt es auch auf jeden Fall Frauen, die so heißen. Selbst wenn eine Frau vllt. nicht direkt Thomas heißt, dann kann sie ja trotzdem Thomasine heißen. Das kann man nicht ausschließen. Und es gibt auch Flüchtlinge, die Thomas heißen. Also vermutlich nicht so viele und ich weiß das auch nicht sicher, aber gibt es bestimmt auch. Wenn nicht so viele Flüchtlinge hier wären, dann wäre der prozentuale Anteil der Männer, die Thomas heißen, bestimmt höher. Aber ich wollte eigentlich einfach nur sagen, dass es da diesen Mann gibt, den ich kenne, der Thomas heißt. Ich selbst kenne nur einen. Klar, es gibt wahrscheinlich noch mehr Männer, die Thomas heißen. Aber nicht alle Männer heißen so! Und das ist ja eigentlich die Hauptsache! Gut, dass wir das geklärt haben!

Mein Punkt ist: Ich führe solche Diskussionen nicht. Weil sie sind immer gleich. Und man kann nicht immer alle Eventualitäten mit erklären. Vor allem nicht hier. Ein Post darf höchstens 2200 Zeichen haben. Wenn ich sage: ""manche"" oder ""nicht alle"", dann meine ich nicht alle und schreib das nicht nach jeder Zeile nochmal. Und andere Themen sind halt andere Themen und es geht nicht immer um alles.

Les molesta que las mujeres tengamos voz, les molesta la realidad.

Pero adivinen que? Ya no nos vamos a dejar pisar jamás.

Como dije en el post del video que borraron, les asusta el feminismo porque los hace replantearse la mierda que les hicieron a las mujeres por tantos siglos.

Valeva la pena di arrampicarsi fino alla Riviera dei Fiori per questa presentazione molto più popolata e vivace di quanto mi aspettassi. Jasmin (l’ho scritto sbagliato?), Lorenza, Giulia e Irene del gruppo di lettura @leombredeilibri, con Arianna in appoggio esterno, Nadia all’organizzazione e Lucia alle letture, mi hanno fatto passare una delle serate migliori dell’anno, spettinata a parlare di femminismo in riva al mare.
Unica nota stonata, un tocco di islamofobia (oltre che di “le giovani d’oggi”, ma vabbe’) in una delle domande: è prassi comune, per una certa scuola di pensiero, declassare il femminismo delle donne musulmane, considerarlo ancillare a quello occidentale, minore solo perché non passa per la liberazione pubblica del corpo.  È stancante doverlo ripetere, ma va detto: ognuna fa la sua liberazione come le va. Giudicarla perché non la fa come la faresti tu è solo imperialismo culturale. Farlo quando fra le quattro moderatrici (adolescenti, per la serie: ridimmi quella sulle giovani d’oggi?) c’è una fiera hijabi è surreale.
Menzione d’onore ai maschi nel pubblico per non avere fatto la classica domanda a tema #notallmen a cui rispondo “Vuoi una medaglia?” Il Manuale torna a settembre. Da qua in poi, solo foto di vacanze.

For centuries it was considered a role unto itself. Behind every great man, they cooed. And whilst it is true that nurturing and nourishing, holding space for those we love as universes spin on the end of our fingers, defines the feminine principle, it does not preclude us. We too are comprised of multitudes.

Within this unequal paradigm there have forever been ardent rebels, dynamic dissenters and strong conscious objectors. Long villified, betrayed and burned upon a pyre built by and for the patriarchy, serving only its ends. We may be dismantling it but the stench still lingers. And it looks like a very modern problem: abandoning the self.

Couched in co-dependency and built on people pleasing, in its very simplest terms, we trade ourselves for another. And while this can too apply to #notallmen, with things only going their way for the last 4000 years-ish, they are the exception not the rule. So what does abandoning yourself look like?

Saying yes to anything or anyone you want to say no to.

Trading your boundaries for anothers' or engaging with those committed to ignoring them.

Swapping self care for the needs of others, as though you can thrive without it and they cannot.

Tolerating shitty or abhorrent behaviour because you love someone. More than yourself. Not questioning why that is. Or what you think love is.

Allowing people to abuse you by making excuses for them, their behaviour, their childhood and that dog that bit them once.

Looking for closure or healing at the feet of those who damaged you.

The only exception is our bloody kids because the little darlings are dependent upon us. This everyday stewardship of another to adulthood is parenting. Yet woman still overwhelmingly carry the lioness' share of the work - and now half the mortgage too.

As Carrie Fisher so beautifully put it, no one ever asks men how they balance work and family. Perhaps it is time we started asking ourselves the hard questions behind this awful abandon and tipped the scales back into balance.

How or why do you abandon yourself?",notallmen,"|👌|❤️|Ironically, and always one to buck the norm, it’s been the women on my life that I’ve experienced this at the hands of, and certainly allowed abuse from - so very rarely the men!

I booked it without thinking or I would never have done it, have never done it. Immediately my guilt had me trying to plan and arrange a holiday for my kids and ex...which was rebuffed thank goodness but taught me the lesson of the crippling guilt when I dare to do something for myself, that isn’t ‘fair’ or ‘equal’, like my caregiving to them ever is. Now I am two weeks away and I see the eye roll and head shake every time my kids dad mentions my Holiday. All the disapproval and distain and undeservingness is bound up and unleashed in those gestures. I’m trying to not defend myself, my needs, my wants, my spirit. Not to him. This holiday is not just relaxation for me it’s a challenge and demons will be faced. It is part of my journey and evolution as an individual.

992,95,"CATCALLING IS VERBAL ABUSE and a symptom of r*pe culture. 😢 I don’t know where to start with this topic. This summer has been really tough and uncomfortable for me as I have experienced a lot of threatening catcalling situations. I have always considered catcalling a “minor” assault but this year I have often reacted with tears to unsolicited sexual attention in public spaces. That sh*t is so humiliating. THERE ARE NO FUKKING SAFE SPACES to be, as a feminine person, I am literally SCARED every time I pass stranger men. Bc the risk of them announcing their sexual desire for me is too fukking high. Do you guys NOT UNDERSTAND how scary you are, when you and your boys stop on the street as I’m standing by myself at 1am, to tell me that it’s your homies birthday and expect me to “treat” him with some sort of attention?  Do you GROWN 50 y/o men NOT UNDERSTAND how humiliating it is when you in a group of 10 drunk men cheer at me from your bar table on the street and react with laughter and more cheering as a say “fuk u”?? IT IS SO DEGRADING AND DEHUMANISING AND SCARY It makes me feel so little and helpless 😭 And one of the worst damn parts is that when you once in a while confront your predator it will mostly end up in more verbal abuse and humiliation. PSA TO MEN: IT IS NOT NICE TO KNOW THAT U WANNA SMASH. IT IS HIGHLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND TRIGGERING AND GIVES ME ANXIETY AND LOW SELF ESTEEM. 🥺🥺🥺🤬 Please, if you want, share your catcalling stories in the comments. I want you to know that your feelings of being assaulted are VALID and that one is NEVER ASKING FOR IT when unsolicited sexual attention comes their way. 👭👫👬",notallmen,"|Or cis men? Or just men 🤷‍♂️|Aside from the ever popular “hey baby/beautiful!” Recently a man approached my friend and i in a parking lot, told us we were so beautiful and asked our names, what we were doing and where we were going. Not only does it annoy me that these men expect answers and expect you to respond, i also then have to consider A) How close I am to my home and whether I should walk a different route B) Is he actually going to follow us and should we wait to go home and go into a cafe C) if he DID follow me and I wasnt aware, how simple would it be for him to wait until the evening and scale my 2nd floor balcony? These are the thoughts that race through my brain the second a strange man tries to nose his way into my business.|👏🏻👏🏻|yes!!! 🙌🙌🙌 i run around in public with so much tension, it would drive anyone insane.|I was wearing a t-shirt that said “buy weed from women” and apparently this man didn’t get a good enough view so he pulled my hair back from my neck and re positioned the T-shirt. I was shocked. Told him to fuck off and gave him a little speech about boundaries. Hope he learns next time to ask for consent when touching and photographing someone.|Not cat calling but about 10 years ago my friend and I (15yrs old at the time) were at the beach in a small holiday town. We were laying on the sand reading magazines when we notice a guy pull up in his car and open his passenger door, then proceeded to get a towel and put it over the window of his drivers side.(so no one could see in) He's sitting in the drivers seat and we can see directly in because his passenger door was open. We mind our own business and continue reading. Then I notice he keeps staring at us. I start feeling majorly uncomfortable then I noticed his arm moving up and down. Yep, he was staring at us and WANKING. I panic and tell my friend, she looks over and freaks out too. We grabbed our stuff and ran so fast outta there, to which he drove off and started following us, luckily we lost him on side streets. We ran back to the holiday house and told my family what happened and worst part was they didn't even seem phased. 😣|i’ve luckily never been catcalled and i’m terrified of it, i’m 13 and i shouldn’t have to worry about this. :(|Hi also not just Hetero men, literally any man that wants to make a femme presenting person feel small.|Dengang der var en far der i Lalandia stalkede mig og fortalte at han havde sagt til hans søn; prøv at hive i de snore  og pegede på snorrene på min bikini top.

Another incident was me walking to my car again but this time a car full of guys drove and stopped in front of me and said some disgusting things to me then drive away. Luckily I graduated from that school but I was terrified.|They don’t care how we feel. At all. They keep reminding us of that over and over. Anytime we try to speak up or fight back. They feel like they win, no matter what we do.

I laughed and said fuck off , prompted further harassment he would speed up and brake and when I was still walking back on the sidewalk would continue to let me know how much I wanted his fat cock and he could tell I wanted it cause of my cute little laugh, which was only a nervous fear response|i was 13, walking down my street in my very safe neighborhood when this car of 3 boys slowed down next to me and commented on my appearance. i shook it off, until they turned around in someone’s driveway. their next comment was a sexual desire they had. i sped up to get to my friends house because i suddenly felt unsafe. they turned around again, stopping next to me to get my number, and that’s when i ran. catcalling? don’t do it! thank you :)|😂😂😂 wao you really need help asap|@1kynan1|ill often end up wearing earbuds and blasting my music so that i don't have to hear what people are saying, but sometimes people go out of their way like some middle aged man who decided it was acceptable to shoot finger guns at my boobs on my way to work at fucking 7:30am|man: ""you're beautiful""

It's not okay. It never is. But considering my young age (which people could tell I was!) is another boundary which must not be crossed. I wished I could just pepper spray them, because it feels like being attacked.|I experience catcalling and I agree that it’s so degrading and terrifying. Once me and two of my friends were walking down the street around midnight and some men came up the road in a car and yelled for us to come to them. We started to run and it was one of the most terrifying things that has every happened to me. We heard their brakes screech as they turned their car around to come after us. We ran down my road and the car followed us. Finally we got to my house and my mum let us in. The car then stayed outside my house for a while. This shows why I have a reason to be scared if I’m catcalled or looked at. It honestly disgusts me when people behave this way.|@barbinijess|Wtf did we do to y'all like a woman can verbally abuse a man pathetic|you have no right to be that afraid, women in poorer countries are subject to honor killings and being dragged in to human trafficking on a daily basis. just because some men act inappropriately in public isn’t an excuse to be a misandrist|I want to look at shit post not shitty posts|I deal with creepy older men saying things to me at work everyday.

All my support and prayers to everyone going through these events. 🙏❣️🙏|one time when I was 12 me and my other 12 year old child friend were walking down the boardwalk of our town (and I was a young lookin 12) when we heard a man on a bike calling us from behind. we just kept walking because we both couldn’t fathom he’d be talking to us, as we were children, until the guy literally pulled up on his bike in front of us, had to be like 40 years old but at 12 he seemed ancient, and told us we were “his fantasy, like the Olsen twins” and I stg he licked his lips 🤦🏼‍♀️ that was the first time I was ever catcalled but yeah it’s gotten worse since then 😂😭🤯|BuT iT’s JuSt A cOmPliMeNt. Assholes will never understand. I’ve literally had to stop my friends when they’ve been drunk and running towards a girl, who was walking home alone at 01 at night! Just to ask her if she wanna come with him.

How can you not understand that’s such a scary thing, when a group of guys are walking towards you and suddenly one of them starts running towards you.. It’s so embarrasing when men can’t see how wrong it is.|Sad thing is that most of them are out to incite these feelings in women|And any reaction, is an “overreaction”. The fragile masculinity can’t cope with potential humiliation, so then you’re either: hysterical, crazy, a whore, a bitch or a dyke. 
If the monkey can’t reach the fruit, suddenly it’s because it was rotten, and then you just get harassed even more aggressively.|I hate this so f*cking much! I am so sick of cishet men feeling the need to comment on womens bodies / looks, and feeling that it is their right. Right outside my building is a cab waiting area, and one of the drivers met my boyfriend in town and told him that he thinks I am fuckable🤢 I hate having to walk right by every time I leave the apartment. 😷 In this town I have also been catcalled too many times to count and even followed by a catcaller one evening, where I ended up having to take a long detour through a crowded area to get away😞|When I was a kid in the 90s I absolutely adored the Spice Girls! I still do, they are amazing ladies. I convinced my mum to get me a bright yellow crop top with SPICE across the chest, as well as matching flared yellow trousers that similarly said SPICE down the leg. I thought I looked amazing. I wore it to the airport on the way to our family holiday in Spain. A security guard made a comment, I can’t remember what it was cause I was too young to understand but I remember feeling icky and disgusting. My dad had serious words with the man, he was really angry. I never wore that outfit again. I was 8 years old.|it’s awful, it’s pervasive, and YES it is traumatizing. growing up in baltimore city i wasn’t allowed to walk by myself many places alone; one time i was allowed to go to the main area of my neighborhood when i turned 12. i was walking by two men in the alcoved entrance to a barber shop in the area and as i passed i saw from the corner of my eye a man step out of the shadows and say “pretty little figure” (i was wearing JEANS and a FLANNEL)|YESS!!! Catcalling can be HORRIBLE. I feel you 100%|@christin_usa @aetnom these are good|Walking home from a night out me and my two friends were followed by a man. He started speaking louder and louder in a language we didn't understand so first we thought he was on the phone. He ended up getting his d*ck out and chasing us down the street. We ran and screamed, but when the police arrived he was long gone. So happy that I was not alone because we kind of scared him off.|every fuckin day|Agree with every word|I had three incident happening on the same night biking home from work (i’m a bartender) one guy litterally jumped out in front of me, on my bike, to let me know i should go home with him..... after another shift, a male regular followed me home and even with him with me I got catcalled. The regular couldnt believe their audacity. And i was like, this is the shit i deal with all the time. This summer has been rough, because I no longer ignore it, if someone catcalls me or touches me innapropiatly i call them out. It often leads to a heated debate, but i’m just so tired of feeling uncomfortable.|I was 20 at the time about three years ago. While I was walking around with my friend an elderly man in his 50s said to me “nice legs! Can I cum between them?” I was disgusted and did honestly not know how to react. @bloomhug remember? 😣|Once I was walking down the street with my girlfriend at the time, and one guy in a group of frat bros yelled out to us, ""I wanna fuck you in the ass!"" None of them said anything else, not even to each other. Maybe they were uncomfortable by it, but didn't know how to react? I don't know. Street harassment is really scary and triggering for me, too. I hate being afraid to walk around outside while looking as feminine as I'd like to.|Oh, they KNOW it makes us feel like this. That’s the entire design function. To keep us small and in our “place”. 🤬|I'm 15 and of course i wasn't used to catcalling or those disgusting ""thirsty"" looks of men 3 times older than me. And of course I am not used to it now and I WILL NEVER get used to it since that would be pretty dumb getting used to something that makes u feel uncomfortable af. Sadly i have experienced situations like that and since the first time I've never walked past a man/group of men without being scared. I always try to walk really fast and i look down all the time, which doesn't look very confident. It SUCKS.|Du er så fucking sej 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 og totalt relateable by the way 🤬|Ditto. Every time it happens it feels like an attack on me as a woman, in the deepest way. Tbh im done with it. Next time imma yell back to tell them they can get fined €100 euros for being a dickwad like that (holland is finally stepping the fuck up)|Holy shit this hits - @brianne_mae|I live in New Zealand where people do it in broad day light when you’re at the beach or walking to the shops so I always confront them and tell them it’s disgusting. Last summer I was walking up from the beach and there was two teenage boys sitting in the car and one of them cat called me and I walked up to the car and said that’s harassment and it’s disgusting behaviour, you’re probably making your friend super uncomfortable too which is gross and they both looked so awkward. If I’m in a safe space I always confront people and say that’s disgusting and they’re always shocked. At night though when you’re alone in the street it’s terrifying and I would never confront someone late at night when I’m feeling unsafe. Digesting behaviour and definitely sexual harassment.|Difficult to feel safe when your mind and body is being invaded all the time and it almost never gets taken seriously when you tell them to fuck off 🙄
Sucks getting sexualized before we’ve even had the possibility of exploring and getting to know our own sexuality.|Got cat called 3 hours ago walking my dogs. 🙄|Literally|Wtf|@nicolakinghorn every god damn day :(|I experience this daily. I'm depressed and full of anxiety. There have been so many times when it even snowballs. I'll be crying in a corner having a panic attack and a dude will walk up and give me the once over and grab his crotch while I'm already visibly hiding my face and crying. Same thing happened as I was walking down the sidewalk crying after someone wouldnt stop yelling at me from their car, and some dudes at a table outside yelled ""HEY! OH SORRY I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU BUT SINCE YOU HAD YOUR FAVE COVERED I WASNT SURE"" and I just walked half a block more and sunk to the ground and bawled for a while. i didnt care what happened at that point. It's like they thought me hiding my face and crying was an invitation to scream at me. I've had so many other incidents that theres not enough space on here. Just know I am here with you and I feel your pain.|@_zoeschulz|@laurabxnks|Im in a very weird place, because for the last few years ive been the right amount of fat that I’m practically invisible in my home country, and also haven’t been out much at night so catcalling has been a super rare occurrence. Over the last year I’ve slowly lost quite a bit of weight, which was necessary for my health and is also having lots of positive impacts on my mobility, so I should be really pleased with it. 
Instead, I spent a month in a country where my very blonde hair is a novelty and I was approached constantly. The culture I was in wasn’t even especially aggressive. If you rejected them they would even apologise and leave you alone, but you were still watched with hungry eyes all the time and were constantly playing the “if I reject you are you going to escalate” mental game because you’re constantly being approached. And i wasn’t prepared for it because my size has excluded me from that kind of relentless approach for so long. It was so constant that i started taking taxis everywhere, even if I could walk, because then I knew I’d only have to deal with the taxi drivers advances, not a dozen on the street. I went out with a some colleagues a few times and one of my male colleagues commented that it was getting exhausting protecting me because they didn’t want anything to happen to me on their watch, and so had been running interference every time someone tried to approach. *they* were losing patience with it all after one night, so imagine how stressed i was in public. 
I assumed that when I returned to Australia things would calm down again, but apparently im now creeping into the size range where you are noticeable as a sex object for men here too and now I’m working through a bunch of shit. I have a little more weight to lose for health reasons, but I’m having to deal with the very real fear of becoming a frequently sexually viewed object again and I honestly don’t know if I can cope.|Every time I go for a run in my local park, I receive unwanted and often sexually motivated comments from random men. A couple of weeks ago I got so mad that I shouted at one of them, he looked at me like I was insane. Proof of how entitled some men feel to objectify any and every female body that comes within their reach.
#catcallingisneversexy|I was harassed by two drunk men when I was walking home with my groceries. It was the middle of the day. They said they wanted to go home with me and tried to follow me, but I lost them on side streets.

My anxiety peaks in public for fear of the leering looks from men. I'm in a sunny mood today though so I'll share a funny one. 🌞  I was hiking in the Lake District. While I walking the suburban streets en route to the starting point of my hike a semi truck turned a sharp roundabout into the street I was headed. Driver beeped the horn at me whilst the passenger (tradie) leaned out the window to holler & leer at me. I flicked them the bird. Meanwhile as they were busy focusing on me they turned into that sharp roundabout ever so quickly that they lost half of their load of untethered stone blocks off the back of the cab and caused a looong traffic jam all the way back to busy Keswick. 🌞 I had a jolly good hike that day.|@the.little.saumench|I was once cat called as I was getting off a tram. Two men in a car said, 'flash your ass slut' followed by jeering and laughter. I gave them the finger, which made them angry and they kept shouting horrible things at me.

Have you ever had to trip in the middle of a smooth walk, blank out, 
and then stand still while it all rushed back to you in one big dump? 
The crash, so loud! 
That lid blowing off with a clang, cringe worthy.
Loud, so loud!
Only inside your head.

Have you ever had your heart beat the life out of your ribcage?
Had sweat running down your spine while the chill ran up the same chilling all your bones one after the another?
Had your hands and feet fail you, had them unlearn their only action  in a few seconds when you needed them the most?
Have you ever stood infront of a door, knowing it is the only way out of the hell and begged your hand to please get the knob right before those hands could come get your flesh?
Have you?

Have you ever cried in disgust for your own skin?
Had you ever the control torn away from your hands? Been told your body isn't yours?
Have you ever had to stand in a street corner frozen after a bike passed you fast?
Have you ever had to get up in the middle of the night, get yourself scrubbed clean, because it was that nightmare again!

Have you ever had to heal, break, heal again, and break once again for the umpteenth time?
Have you any idea how much that takes out of you!
Have you ever, ever believed to have been okay only for a single thread to undo it all in a moment?
A touch, a look, a comment, a meme, a song, a picture, or,
or a line in a book... Have you ever had to drown, fight for a breath and hear a maniac laughing at you? 
#NotAllMen 
#NotAllMen 
#NotAllMen 
Exactly how the laugh sounds!
Have you ever had to fight yourself, agree, deny and stand in the middle of giving up and starting over?
Have you ever hit that rock bottom where only you and an ugly hand exists?

Have you ever, ever had to watch the explosion happen?
See it all methodically break?
Once over again! 
Glass doors you built up from scratch one inch at a time, all those years worth of healing that it took to get it stand okay cracking,
cracking oh so slowly, 
loud! So loud!
But then, 
only inside your head. 
Like always, only ever inside your head. - Sara Jothi

1004,107,"El señorito Dalas es un ejemplo perfecto de macho sin cerebro al que hay que evitar, mantener alejado, tal y como un apestado. De estos hay muchos y, lamentablemente, algunos con voz y seguidores en las redes que fomentan la desinformación sobre la lucha feminista y el odio injustificado a lo que no logran entender. Dan penica, pero también dan pie a que muchas personas se crean el absurdo discurso del #NotAllMen y la descabellada idea de que las feministas queremos acabar con los hombres o, como mínimo, meterlos a todos en el mismo saco. Y, claro, terminamos hasta las narices de tener que explicar siempre lo mismo, que no odiamos a los hombres, que no queremos destruirlos a ellos, sino al maldito patriarcado.

1006,109,"Today at a Dunkin Donuts drive through I witnessed a man demanding the attention of a woman employee who was cleaning the outside of the restaurant. The oldish man was ranting about how men today all have stupid man buns and scruffy shit on their faces (which side note, implies that men of his generation are superior and should be more attractive to youngish women like this employee). The woman was simply trying to do her job, and instead this man was demanding her attention to listen to his asinine ranting that I am 99% sure she was not interested in. This is an example of a man believing that a woman existing in public space doing her job is there specifically to pay attention to him. He believed he was entitled to her attention, and it’s because this is what we teach boys and men. But women and femmes don’t owe you shit. We aren’t here to coddle, or stroke egos, or mitigate loneliness. When I find myself in situations like the one I described, I often just grit my teeth and listen and smile. This is to keep myself safe - to avoid the potential hazards of refusing to engage (hazards which include verbal harassment and even violence). But the truth is, we should be able to exist without having to attend to random men around us. It’s not rude to not engage. It’s gaslighting to be told that “they’re just being nice” or “they’re just being friendly”. We don’t owe you our time or attention. #thesweetfeminist #sweetfeminism",notallmen,"|Preach. 🙌🏻|What do you do with all these cakes? Sell them? Eat them? Give them away?

She had to stand and smile as he wasted a significant amount of her time. The fact that I noticed while entertaining a toddler, tells you how obvious and obnoxious it was.

I then put my earbuds in. He didn't say anything further, which was surprising because a few people were laughing.

1008,111,"Update: 
Readings of red pill told me he didn’t know the answer to how it’s possible that the brain of the lgbt female is able to surpass the “biological hardwiring” that predetermines the “innate” alpha arousal that red pill claims is how the female is born. This alpha arousal dictates how women are only aroused by the alpha male, meaning it’s the reason beta males don’t get sex with a woman, and further explains female narcissism. (😂)
*
I now need to find an MRA who has thought through his philosophy of hate a little bit more. I chose readings of red pill initially bc he has a page dedicated to red pill philosophy where he posts multiple times a day. The thing is, I do think this person is open to exploring his beliefs a bit more, which is positive. The problem is that their philosophy of hate has no basis in reality, and it’s no surprise there are multiple holes in their feels. Maybe another MRA can give me a well thought out explanation 🤷‍♀️

1016,119,"""I AM SICK OF ALL YOU MAN HATERS... AM I THE FUCKING PATRIARCHY? NO. I AM NOT. ENOUGH. PLEASE""

This is a quote from a post that appeared on my facebook page today. I am not tagging names, because it's not about shaming. This is a sentiment I have seen from a LOT of men.

What I hear is that they feel they are supporting women's issues yet feel personally attacked by women still. I hear hurt. Frustration.
I mean, I get it. Maybe you feel you have never done something to hurt a woman, or you don't consciously go around saying ""quiet woman! I am above you!""
So it feels unfair. And it hurts.

I get it, but I don't accept it, and this is why... Unfortunately, you ARE the patriarchy.

As am I.

In the same way we white people are all inherently racist, brought up and educated by a white culture means we inherently have bias, privilege and entitlements that we probably can't even see.

It's the same with the patriarchy.

And to be honest, In Australia we have more than one woman a week murdered by a man (many ones she is in relationships with but also in Melbourne there has been a spread of random street attacks over the past few years)

If this doesn't say that something is still very wrong in the mindset of our society then I don't know what does.

The problem comes when men (and people, white people in the same story of racism) choose to personalise the conversation rather than remember that, even though they may be a ""good guy"" they are built by (and live in) a society which still innately treats women as inferior, less worthy and as objects which men are entitled to.

Your status itself stinks of male fragility, and I get it. It's fucking hard to own.

Shame and blame is a fucked way of dealing with these things emotionaly and it is, unfortunately, the dominant way we are taught. So we need to learn to step out of it, stop reacting from shame or blame and actually create action for resolution and change. (continued in comments)",notallmen,"|But when most men's biggest fears about women is that they will be teased and laughed at my them...and most women's biggest fears about men are that they will be raped and murdered by them... When women are still paid less, still do not feel safe to walk home, still are not safe in their own homes, still get silenced,  talked down to, cat called, persuaded to do what they don't want with emotional or physical manipulation...Then there is,  unfortunately, no way for you to step out of the conversation and pretend you are not involved. 
You are. 
As am I.
The patriarchy is perpetuated by all of us, irregardless of gender, and the shifts can only happen when we begin to own that.|#feminism #notallmen #womensrights #patriarchy #fuckthepatriarchy #womenspeak #iamnotthepatriarchy #yesyouare #racism #whitefragility #malefragility #joinus #ownit #gotoveryourself|Great post!👍🏼👊|It's the toxic miasma we *all* swim in, regardless of sex or gender or sexuality; it's as inescapable as racism. Accepting and facing that is the only way to start healing self and society,|This is SUCH an important edge for all of us, and particularly for guys. Males seem to be caught in a ME/MEn vortex. Women experience the WE more than the ME. This makes it difficult for males to be more objective about this  broader phenomena/paradigm. Patriarchy Is primarily a State of Mind, flowing into behaviours and Social Structures & Institutions. Patriarchy Elevates the Masculine Principle & Males, and Devalues the Feminine Principle & Females & marginalised people. Materialism has drawn us back into the polarity of Masculine OR Feminine. The true liberation is to recognise that, on a soul level, every human being has BOTH Principles, which we need to dynamically balance- individually and collectively. Feminism has worked to enable women to take up more of the Masculine Principle & outer life. Men have taken up more of their Feminine Principle & inner life- however, I’ve seen this stall over the past decades. Patriarchy is an addictive paradigm- the soul’s yearnings are “satisfied” with material solutions. It’s more confronting for us to get real and feel. We are individuals. We can opt out of tribal loyalty and thinking, but it is a conscious and conscientious process. We can opt out of the paradigm- but not before we understand the dynamics of patriarchy-  our complicity; our shame & guilt & paralysis; our advantages and the resulting disadvantages to others; the polarising nature of it’s thinking (either/or, winner/loser, one up/other down, debate& refute, etc. AND. WITH. TOGETHER. CO-OPERATION. CONVERSATION. This is the territory! Not a moment to lose!|And furthermore!! The most difficult mind f><k for men, is that they have to uphold the Flag of Manhood, no breaking rank! And that they have to look like they know what they are doing... particularly if they don’t!! This means that learning about patriarchy from women ,and particularly feminists, constitutes a terrible “loss of face.” Humility is a fine Feminine Principle attribute! Shame can be transformed into humility! That’s The Good News!!|Excellent post @fleassymalay|Thank you|Ooh I like this a lot!|Yep folks check your privilege bingo here:

As far the politeness goes, It’s actually because oh how we were raised to not show emotion, and how for the most part, we weren’t given affection when we were young. Which has led guys think that even the slightest bit politeness or affection is a sign of interest. Now with that being said there are guys who think like that and there are guys who were given proper love as kids and don’t have these behavioral patterns. And in all honesty if we begin to raise our kids with love compassion and responsibility then there’s so many patterns like that that can be eliminated. Then guys today should be encouraged to seek emotional intelligence and should be encouraged to feel and allow their feelings. “Your feelings are your superpower” is one thing (I believe) we should teach ourselves, our kids and tbh everyone. Knowledge is power hunnies|😂😂😂 Yes|True!!!|@motiv8ed_me starting a conversation with ""that's actually not true"" is one of the most condescending ways to respond.

1031,134,"I feel like it is important to note that, as I was walking to the park to finish this book, two men in a large, dark SUV revved their engine and yelled at me in an intersection, ""You better move, you fucking bitch!"" I could hear them laughing as they sped away behind me. There was no reason for this outburst. There was no traffic, and I *was* moving, jogging across, like a model pedestrian. Two other men looked on in silence as I scurried the last few feet like a scared rabbit. I continued to the park with my shoulders hunched, feeling low and miserable, reliving that cruel laughter. There is something broken in the way many men learn about masculinity, that leads them to believe wholeheartedly in their right to occupy authority of any space at any time and cut down what stands in their way. In that moment, those men in that huge car made me question my right to exist in this world. I feared for my safety, and they laughed. Solnit writes: ""Every woman who appears wrestles with the forces that would have her disappear."" She identifies a contimuum of violence, between ""minor social misery"" and life-threatening violence. They go hand in hand.  Those men didn't want to murder me, but they wanted to make me feel like dirt, and they did. I'm not going to assuage anyone's defensiveness with a #notallmen.

I, or anyone I know, hasn't been attacked by a snake. Why are they playing the victim? Surely, they jumped in the pit themselves, why else would the snakes cave into the temptation? Obviously they are trying to play the ""man card"". Not to mention, what were they doing in such a dangerous part of the town? Are you sure they weren't asking for it? And why didn't they talk about it earlier? They should've screamed or tried to call for help. Clearly, they are just trying to get the poor snakes in trouble after consenting to the bites. The witnesses? Aren't men gold-diggers? Of course, they have been bribed into saying this. I have been friends with the snakes for a long time and I never felt uncomfortable, even when we were hiking or when I went to their snake pit, so why would they attack them?  But then agin, we can't blame any of the people involved in this until the court, which is surely full of unbiased snakes, comes to a conclusion.

C'est ce qui justifie cet usage linguistique et celui-ci a sa pertinence.
Le cas analogue du ""not all men"" est plus connu et plus ancré. S' il y a évidemment des personnes pour s'en offusquer, l'usage de la catégorisation ""les hommes"" est compris dans les milieux feministes et a sa pertinence.
Face a ça, l'usage du ""les cisgenres"" fait beaucoup plus hurler, notamment chez les femmes cisgenres. On peut y voir un manque de deconstruction de ses privilèges de la part d'un groupe social certes oppressé, mais perpétrant également des oppressions. Cette compréhension sélective de la formulation généralisante est aussi preuve d'à quel point il est difficile de se remettre en question.
Il est absolument nécessaire de réussir a mettre de côté la vexation compréhensible que certaines analyses peuvent susciter car les egos empêchent une vision objective de sa propre place dans notre société.
Les femmes cisgenres ont des privilèges face aux femmes trans, les femmes blanche ont des privilèges face aux femmes racisées, les femmes valides ont des privilèges face aux femmes handicapées... Rien de personnel, juste un constat objectif qui appelle prise de consciences et actions en conséquence.

1038,141,"Book 30/52 of 2019: How to Date Men When You Hate Men by Blythe Roberson. A very real existential question for most straight women in 2019 (and lots of queer folks, too!), honestly. I felt Very Seen by a lot of this book (particularly the Romantic Friendships portion, don’t @ me). I also felt like maybe she is overthinking a lot of things, but that might be kind of obvious, based on the fact that this book exists. plus, who am I to talk? I certainly haven’t unlocked The Secret to Dating. Overall, a funny and relatable (Sorry, Blythe!! Is it better if it comes from a woman? idk) read. Recommend for people who are Very Frustrated with men, even the ones who are generally wonderful, whether because feminism or just because Someone Needs To Teach Men Texting/Flirting, Gah! (Sidenote: before any men get their panties in a twist, most of us don’t actually *hate* you. We’re just tired and flippant. But that should be pretty obvious without anyone having to say it.) .

I feel like that particular page needs to start serving some warnings and start to clean house, because there's a bunch of insecure males, boys more like, that have to pull others down to make themselves feel better. And there is only a few, banning them won't effect the page stats, it's a pack mentality and everyone gets behind the Alpha and it snowballs, just ban the Alphas. It's different from giving each other stick, and banter,  that line needs to be determined because too many try to hide behind it, banter is important it builds character but outright bullying and regurgitating your own inadequacies on some one isn't and can be soul destroying. Also I think that those sorts of posts dont 'trigger' people who are supportive or are secure in themselves so we dont feel prompted to comment as frequently, which means the negativity out ways the positive, and then it just becomes posts in defence, when really we need to try and encourage and build people up where ever we can....let's not just hit the like button but drop a comment of support I reckon it would show the negative is a minority 👍👍👍|Man I hate the term ‘political correctness’.

1045,148,"Dear boys,

I know life is hard. You have to worry about making something of yourself while keeping all your stress locked in. You are told you need to provide for not only yourself but also your parents, siblings, future wife and kids. I know you can probably talk about all the horrible things in the world but not about your feelings. I know that being considerate, sensitive or just well-mannered will get you picked upon by 'friends' and peers.

I get it.

But think about this for a moment.. have you ever felt scared of walking outside in broad daylight? Have you ever been touched inappropriately in a public place? Have you had someone slide their number into your coat at a concert when you're trying to get through a crowd WHILE whispering in your ear the same thing? Have you received a call from someone who knows your name, where you live, what school you go to and wants to be your 'friend'? Have you opened your messages and been horrified at the filth some stranger has sent you? Have you had someone catcall/say creepy things to you while you walk by?

I have.

It's horrible. It plays with your head for days. You feel like shit. 
Don't be them.

Love, 
M

I do not share this low opinion of males.
.
In my research I critique aspects of masculinity which promote or perpetuates rape culture (and other harmful things) not out of contempt for men, but in defence of them (and women).
.
By lessening the severity of male rapists’ actions by explaining it as a consequence of females actions, it communicates that the male sex is so weak or so propelled by hormones and sexual impulses that it is an inevitability.
.
I don’t believe this.
.
I have an extremely high regard for males; I know that it’s #notallmen, which is precisely why I refuse to let us be let off the hook so easily. Instead of fearing the #metoo movement, I welcome the responsibility of being held accountable to my actions and beliefs. I also take on the responsibility of holding other men accountable for theirs.

1061,164,"When I was five
The man whose blood flows in me
Woke me up at midnight
Kissed my cheeks, 
Hugged me hard
And whispered an apology. 
I barely remember his voice now. 
When I was twelve
The man I came to call my father
Held my hands for the first time
And then my face
And my thighs
And me. 
I still try to wash him off me every night. 
When I was twenty three
The man who took my heart
Smiled at me. 
He looked at me 
Like mortals look at stars, 
With hope and celestial wonder. 
I caress his leftover love even in his absence. 
When I was alive
Not all men
Shattered my dignity
Or took away my pride
Or ruined me from myself, 
But just enough of them did. ~Pragya

1082,185,"From their childhood, the young boys are raised by their parents and teachers based on the society's stereotyped 'masculinity', that is often misunderstood to be strong, bold, outspoken, dominant and aggressive. This is nothing but an essence of the patriarchal notions that already exists in the society where the women are expected to be submissive and men are obviously supposed to be dominant, manifesting into male chauvinism and ultimately toxic masculinity. This is how shallow society understands the genders.

Though the mainstream feminism deals with the upliftment of women to establish gender equality and bring about an egalitarian society, it fails to address effectively the problems of men, which it is supposed to. Unless and until the boys are provided with a space to express themselves and be however they wish to be, they would end up locking their emotions, feelings, and thoughts within themselves. This puts them into a traumatic state where they would eventually end up to a point where they wouldn't know how to express themselves to anyone even if someone is ready to listen and acknowledge them.

For the sake of the society, men wear a disguise of a strong and bold personality, but day by day they become more fragile and unstable inside.

This is definitely an unhealthy sign, as men lose their connection with the society, as their emotions, feelings, cravings, and everything piles up within their mind creating a depression that might someday burst out as a socially awful action.

It must be understood that no human can live alone!

A man needs at least one partner to undress himself out of the social disguise and show the raw, real and flawed side of him without any fear of judgment. Men long for such a connection that fulfills their physical and mental desires.

A simple kiss and caress of one would be a fantasy for the other!
Only when a man finds such a partner, he'd feel complete.

Let's try understanding the men too. ☺️

1083,186,"My goal this year is to finish a book per week. I just finished these:

27. Banshee, Rachel DeWoskin
28. Open Me, Lisa Locascio 
When I determined to read a book every week or so, I aimed to stay away - with very few exceptions - from fiction by cisgender heterosexual white authors, or books by said authors in which the protagonist is white and cis-het, most especially men but women too, with very few exceptions. I made exceptions with these two books and I now remember why I determined I would stay away. Please no one send me #NotAllWhiteWomen or #NotAllMen. 
First book: 
What works: It’s a light read - I finished it in a day and a half. 
What doesn’t: when we’re promised “pure rage,” “burning her life down,” “speaking every truth she’s ever swallowed, and refusing to apologize for her wildest, most essential self” but the protagonist goes on and on about the centrality of motherhood and her daughter to her life (I am childfree by choice for a reason) and the wildest thing that happens is that the protagonist - a 42yo poetry professor married to a wealthy man - starts to have sex with one of her students (granted, a woman but still), I am left wondering “seriously?” Rage and burning things down involve a bit more than that for me.
Second book:
What works: I like the unabashed celebration of an 18yo woman’s body - her orgasms, her sweat, her smells, her belly and thighs, etc
What doesn’t: two thirds of the book are about her relationship with an angry bitter and racist white Dane who hates immigrants and whose racism she barely pushes back against. And she submits to his fantasy of having her play housewife locked up at home waiting for him to come home. HE LOCKS HER UP! And then the last third of the book is about her relationship with a Danish man who was a Muslim refugee from Bosnia who is supposed to - during their few days together - neutralize the racism of angry bitter white Dane. Or something. Look - I celebrate the sexual awakening of a young woman but this was slow and the angry bitter and racist white Dane drove me over the fucking edge.

1087,190,"#روشنفکر مدرن
ضد #فمنیست
کلمه ضد فمنیست شاید در ابتدا برای عده ای اینگونه معنی شود، کسی که مخالف فمنیسم و در نتیجه مخالف برابری حقوق زن و مرد هستش. اما خب معنی این کلمه میشه کسی که با فمنیسم مدرن مخالفه، مخالفه چون باور داره فمنیسم مدرن داره بحث های حاشیه ای مطرح میکنه و تمرکز رو از موضوعات اصلی دور میکنه. 
در کل توی خیلی کشورهای غربی افراد در حالی که موافق برابری حقوق زن و مردهستند اما خودشون رو فمنیست نمیدونن، دلیلش چیه؟ جریان های فعلی فمنیستی.
برخی از مشکلات فمینیسم مدرن:
۱. مرد ستیز بودن #فمینیست ها. قرار دادن واژه ""سمی"" در کنار مردانگی به تعداد زیاد و استفاده از کلماتی مثل
Mansplaining, manspreading
که  سکسیستی هستن، در حالی که آلمانی ها چندوقت پیش تصمیم گرفتند واژه های جنسیتی رو از سرود ملی حذف کنند، عده ای از فمنیست ها در حال ساخت واژگانی سکسیستی هستند. البته این مرد ستیزی توی خیلی جاهای دیگه هم خودش رو نشون میده. برای مثال کتابی که توش آموزش میده چجوری مردها رو متهم به آزارجنسی کنن و زندگیشون رو نابود کنن (عکس کتاب اون بالاست، قبل از اینکه هم بگید هدفش چیز دیگست اسمشو سرچ کنید مشخصاتش و نظرات مردم رو هم توی آمازون بخونید).
۲. #فمنیسم تبدیل به نوعی جدید از فاشیسم شده، چرا؟
چون دارن یک سری قوانین و شرایط وضع میکنند که اگر زن ها مطابق اونها عمل نکنن، نمیتونن ادعا کنن فمنیست هستند‌. چتر حمایت عده ای از فمنیست ها فقط بر سر اونهایی هستش که کاملا باهاشون موافق باشن.  خیلی ها معتقد هستند که فمنیسم یعنی ""دادن حق انتخاب به #زنان"". یعنی اگر زنی بر زنانگی خودش تاکید کنه به این معنی نیست که نمیتونه فمنیست باشه، بلکه انتخاب کرده اینطوری باشه. 
۳. استفاده از جنسیت به عنوان بهانه، قربانی نشون دادن زن ها و متهم کردن همه مردها. چندوقت پیش یک #هشتگ در توییتر ترند شد:
#notallmen
که میگفت خب همه مردها هم بد نیستند‌ ولی خب وبسایتی که شاتش رو گذاشتم معتقده در دنیایی که دو دسته ستمگر و ستمدیده داریم، حتی بهترین مردها هم به خاطر جامعه خطرناکن.
یا مثلا تیم #فوتبال زنان آمریکا یه مدتیه که درخواست حقوق برابر با تیم ملی مردان داره، اما خب مطابق اعداد و آمار با اینکه درآمدشون کمتره اما در اصل زیادی هم دارن حقوق میگیرن. (یه مبلغی هست که به تیم مردان هفت درصدش رو میدن، همون رقم برای تیم های زنان به سی درصد میرسه)، برای توضیحات دقیق این ویدئو رو ببینید:
Women are actually overpaid in soccer
ادامه در کامنت",notallmen,"|۴. در حالی که فمنیسم به معنی برابری زن و مرد هستش، خیلی ها تاکید بر مشابه بودن زن و مرد دارند. یعنی معتقد هستند زن و مرد مشابه هم هستن و هرتفاوتی که میبینیم نتیجه ساخت های اجتماعی هستش و ژنتیک هیچ نقشی نداره. اگر هم توی ورزش عملکرد مردها بهتره نتیجه همون جامعست، نه تفاوت های بین دو جنس.
یک مجله آنلاین خارجی هست به اسم
Everyday feminism
حالا یه پیج ایرانی  یه اسم مشابه داره:

The way I dance
The way I dress
Does not mean yes

Frauen*, lasst euch nicht beschränken, nehmt euch Raum, tanzt wie ihr wollt, zieht an was ihr wollt.

Eine Frau* ist nie verantwortlich wenn sie Übergriffe erlebt, egal wie sie sich bewegt oder was sie trägt!

Männer, respektiert euer Gegenüber, ein Nein ist ein Nein, wahrt die Grenze der anderen Personen!
Achtet auf euer Umfeld, sprecht andere auf ihr Fehlverhalten an!
Solidarisiert euch, setzt euch ein!! ... Women* do not limit yourself, take your space, dance as you like and dress as you want.

A woman* is never responsible if she experiences abuse, no matter how she moves or what kind of clothes she wears!

Dear men, please respect di gal-dem, a no is a no, respect others’ boundaries.
Take care of your environment, address others about their misconduct!
Solidarize yourself and get involved!! #awareness #nosexism #feminism #femaleempowerment #respect #bodypositivity #notallmen #metoo #dancehall

1096,199,"When a woman talks about rape, about harassment, about forced marriages or some other issue like this, when she talks about how something in particular is making her feel unsafe, or putting her in harm's way, and the first thing people respond with is ""Not all men!"" Here's what happens...
1. Her claim, or her concern looses validity. Because now, she's forced to admit that yes not everyone is bad, and that yes, maybe this person might not be either, or her particular situation. Which is seldom the case. It's as if the goal of saying something like this is to say that her problem isn't valid until everyone is doing it. Now instead of people doing something about it, they'll just keep on parroting yeah, not all men, so it's okay. She's exaggerating. 
2. She's demonized for expressing her concerns over VERY REAL issues that happen daily in the world. That are very much a possibility in a woman's life, and that need to be addressed. She can't get the help she should because people made it sound like less of a deal than it should be.
3. Why would someone automatically go on the defensive, when the bad people are being called out for their actions? Is it some guilty conscience? Or maybe they want to avoid the possibility of universal accountability by saying things like this? 
4. Not all men, sure, but enough men for 100% of us to be effected, enough men for it to be a social issue and not a personal one. Even one man doing shit like catcalling or harassment or anything that puts a woman in an uncomfortable position is too much men.
5. What exactly is your point for saying not all men? Do you expect a pat on the back for showing basic human decency, a medal for being a ""good guy""? Well, sorry. If you're one of the good ones (they don't go around trolling feminist pages tho, they sympathize) congratulations. There's no trophy. This is how everyone should be so just back tf up and let the world deal with the shitty ones without crying for attention and asking for that ""yeah, some of you are good too but still"" all over the internet while there's a hell load of people who still think it's their right to own women.",notallmen,|#notallmen #rape #victimblaming #honorkilling #honorkillingsinpakistan #vani #accountability #feminist #feminism #goodmen #humanrights #womensrights #equality #sexism|I just don’t understand why society makes it seem like rape only involves women being raped when it actually happens a lot to men too but many just don’t report it because of the same reasons as woman and the stigma of being called “gay.”,24

I understand the fact that many women can not feel safe around themselves. That is true!
But the fact that men are treated equally poor and harmful in our society is never a topic!

The fact that they actively ignore the worrying reality that nearly/all women and girls have experienced disturbing things by the hands of men/boys to focus on a pathetic thing like ""uM buT it'S noT alL mEn"" proves that they care more about their image/fragile ego than the humans who are suffering because of them.

What about trans men? Do they count too? Listen, I know a lot of men do horrible things like groping or insulting girls etc, but generalising the entire gender is just as fucking wrong as what they're doing. People who say ""not all men"" are not excusing bad behaviour, they're defending guys who are actually good. Because if men are sexist most women are too nowadays, the #menaretrash and all that is wrong, fighting fire with fire or in this case hate with hate is just not gonna work. Sorry but that's just my opinion. If you hate men fine, if you have been hurt or harassed by men I'm sorry, but there are good guys out there and you can't just go and hate on them for stuff they haven't even done. Instead of bashing guys, try teaching younger generations of boys to be better or they'll turn out worse.",4199

Just wanting to go out for a walk without the fear of getting abducted,
Or go out without my bra and not see literally every man ogle at my breasts
Be in a workspace without having to constantly squirm away from unwanted touches.
Is it too much to ask for you to keep your hands off me while i am passed out,
Or not shout profanities from across the street,
Or touch me in a hustling crowd.
Is it really asking too much if i we ask you to take some responsibility for your actions.
Stop your friends from demeaning that one girl who refused to sleep with him.
Don’t make her a slut. She is not. You are just imcompetent, afraid that you’ll lose your potentially rapist friends.
So scared they’ll think you are a pussy.
All you're doing is giving him validation to ignore my no next time.
All you are doing is letting him know that you support his actions.
You can’t just wash your hands off the blood of the innocent girls you could have saved just by stopping your friend that one time he made a rape joke.
Or that one time he whistled at the girl walking down the street and told you how he would like to bang her little ass.
Stop defending toxic masculine characters and whine about how girls are no longer complacent to your wishes.
Is it really too much of a problem for you to be decent? I know it's not all men, 
But why do you fail to understand that when you are a bystander in a heinous crime you could have stopped,
You are no longer innocent.
 It’s not all men, no. But it’s enough men for every girl to think twice before stepping out.
It’s enough men for every 4 in 5 girls to get assaulted.
It’s enough men for every girl to feel not safe enough in their own homes.

Desde hace décadas, las mujeres musulmanas estamos oprimidas. Pero no por nuestra religión, como muchos piensan, sino por aquellas personas de mayoría hombres no musulmanes que creen tener el poder de decidir sobre nosotras. 
Y eso han demostrado cuando nos han prohibido ir al Instituto con Hijab en Madrid, cuando no nos han dejado entrar a las piscinas públicas con Burkini o cuando nos han hachado del trabajo por vestir libremente. 
Otra vez la “justicia” machista y patriarcal ha vuelto a hacer de las suyas. Pero que sepan que no nos vamos a callar, que conocemos nuestros derechos y vamos a luchar para que se normalize que una mujer quiera o no enseñar su cuerpo. 🚫Los comentarios ofensivos serán eliminados🚫

For decades, Muslim women have been oppressed. Not because of our religion, as many people think, but because of the majority of non-Muslim men who believe that they have the power to decide about us.

And they have shown that again by not allowing us to go to High School with Hijab in Madrid, by not allowing us to enter public pools with Burkini and by firing us for dress freely. 
Once again the sexist and patriarchal ""justice"" made it. But we are not going to be silent, we know our rights and we are going to fight so that women can show or not her body without consequences. 🚫Offensive comments will be deleted🚫

1123,226,"Hey guys ! My social experiment is over now, I can deleate aaaaall the pics I put on my insta profile since some days. I just let the last dinodress one cause I love that dress so much.

Thank you to all men who send me dickpics, insult messages, sexual messages, etc... 🙏

My study file is ready and I can continue working with the police 👍
It was really fascinating to watch how easy you fall in a trap with few keywords.

Just a word: those last five days show me how discusting you are. No matter to come with your #NotAllMen, you are disgusting. I already know it, of course, but usually, I bloc, deleate or ignore without thinking of it, I don't screenshot it. You, who tell me you want to fuck me because of my fat ass, you, who tell me you wan't to lick me, to make me dirty things, you, who talk to me and try to make me believe that you never do that to women usually: you are disgusting.

Why coming to women private messages and tell them those things and send them your penis ? I really don't understand what it makes to you. You really enjoy it ? Oo

In only 5 days, with a few keywords, I got so many many different things you can't imagine. I send them to few of my clothest friends and they didn't believe it. THIS is my reality.

THIS is the reality of too much women.

And this is not ""harassment"". This is just some *insert insults here please* people who are looking for... What, actually ? I don't want to imagine the life of those who receive thousand of messages a day. Don't want. Just want to share them love and protect them. Can't wait the moment when a dickpic or an insult could break anonymous to send you in jail. 
I want you to realize people can be terrified by your words. People can die because of your words. Instead of your dirty notallmen, act normally.

1130,233,"TRIGGER WARNING

Kabir Singh has been in the news for the wrong reasons anyway.

The director has now found himself in a wave of controversy, after his visibly dumb statements made in his recent interview.

To put in a very lucid manner - Man abusing woman is wrong. Woman abusing a man is wrong. Don't even try debating this. Got it? Good.

Humans function on power and money. The root of all things somehow finds itself linked to these two elements. Abuse and treating women like trash is deep-rooted in the obsessive need for power and control.

The movie was probably 'okay' to exist before, but NOW, after the director's bold judgments and justifications, the movie should stop ceasing because it normalizes everything that women do NOT deserve. 
If you support Reddy, you probably are the same species who irks at 'All Men Are Trash', and use a lot of 'Not All Men'. Please change. It's never too late. There is always a choice.

Go figure!

Some examples are In cold blood, fight club, even game of thrones challenged our notions of good and bad, right and wrong. I don’t think the purpose of making a movie should be presenting a PC message or to present any kind of propaganda good or bad.. it should be to tell a story as truthfully and as honestly  as possible as the writer or director deems it so.

1134,237,"Getting tagged in a Whit post means one thing: Hi, new followers! Glad to have you here. A couple of things that come up around here a lot:
💜 My hair color is Extreme Purple or Purple with Brown Hair from @overtonecolor. Yes, you’ll need to bleach it first if you want vibrant results, but the PWBH gives even dark brown hair a nice purple tint (especially in natural light) without bleaching first.
🛍 That thing you like that I posted? It’s either from Target or Amazon.
🥘 I post food a lot because I love cooking. I don’t claim to be a  professional chef. If what I made looks gross to you, keep it to yourself.
👩‍👧‍👧 My kids, Ava and Eli, are 10 and 7, at least until September. They’re not on the show much because I usually film when they are not with me, since that’s primarily when I socialize.
👨🏻I post a lot of screenshots of shitty dudes from my online dating experiences. They’re not all like that (if you’re a good guy, I DO know you exist and it’s #notallmen) but it’s a fair representation of what it’s like. I black out their photos and screen names because I get accused of online bullying if I don’t.
📺 No, I don’t know when the show will be back. When I know I’ll share.
🤷🏻‍♀️Sometimes I am self-deprecating. As much as it’s appreciated, you don’t have to comment letting me know how great I am or how my prince will come eventually. It’s (probably) being said in jest. But not always—I’m pretty open with my struggles.
⌨️I try to answer questions in the comments, but check to see if someone else has already asked, and please don’t hate me if I don’t respond.
🌊 Yes, I’ll be on the #NoBSatSea cruise. It’s my birthday that week and you should totally come celebrate with me.

1141,244,"Caro,

Credo non ci sia una frase peggiore del 'grazie di tutto, ma ora ti vedo come amico'. Qui non si tratta della mitologica friendzone che qualche #notallmen vorrebbe ancora usare contro noi donne. Qui si tratta di educazione sentimentale di base. Sono parole che feriscono inutilmente, quindi perché dirle? 
Può essere che nel tuo caso particolare sia proprio una questione anagrafica, il ragazzo è giovane quindi si confonde facilmente. Beh no, questa è una stronzata. Non è mai un problema di età. Quando io ero una ventenne furiosa sapevo benissimo quello che volevo: collezionare esperienze, collezionare maschi alti, biondi e più grandi di me. E lo facevo senza fermarmi mai per chiedermi: ma loro che cosa vogliono?

Ero crudele? Forse, però era il mio modo di sentirmi finalmente corporea, di scoprire cose su di me che fino a quel momento avevo evitato. Il ragazzo che stavi frequentando probabilmente non avrà motivi tanto filosofici per comportarsi male. Forse è solo stronzo. Forse più che te, gli piaceva l'idea di se stesso che vedeva riflessa nei tuoi sguardi per lui.

Ma in fondo, chissenefrega? Non siamo qui per psicanalizzare giovani amanti della poesia. So che hai una passione particolare per questi piccoli friky, ma magari dovresti dare una chance ai 'fashion blogger milanesi isterici'. Che ne sai, magari scopano altrettanto bene ma rompono meno il cazzo con le loro indecisioni.",notallmen,|Niceeeeee!,24

1157,260,"I’m not complaining about anybody, and I won’t. But, speaking from a personal standpoint, these are the women that a lot of men are intimidated by. #NotAllMen but, a lot. Men, being men, want to be needed. So, with that, a lot of men gravitate more to the “wounded birds.” I feel it’s an exchange of low self-esteems. To each their own. 
Anyone, I think, man/woman that has worked hard to get themselves established/stable, aren’t willing to just jump out there with any ‘ol thing, just to claim themselves an item. That would be settling. We look for likeminds, mirrored ambition/goals, similar/equal beliefs, so on & so forth. Single women “usually” carry the weight of their children (s/o to men that handle their business regardless), but, we’re not willing to gamble with deadweight because not only will it cost US, sh*t rolls downhill. Now, if the person has potential, and exhibits this in a way where it’s obvious that we can build, we’re down! But, ain’t nobody linking up with no anchors after working so hard to keep their heads above water. If their like me, I refuse to even entertain it. #JMO",notallmen,"|I believe most successful women at that point have build a wall up.

1158,261,"How to unmask toxic masculinity?

Society tells us to “be a man”, that men are strong and have to provide and protect. This is a huge weight on their shoulders. If they feel as though they are not doing these things that add up to being a man, they feel as though they have failed. In media especially, there are only a few type of men shown. And the ones who express more emotions are looked at to be weak. We have the womanizer, superhero, good, all-star athlete and in many of these stories, sexual conquests play a large role.

An example used is the saying “you play like a girl” when as little boy was asked how he would feel if a coach said this to him, he responded, “I would feel destroyed.” We are teaching them to think what girls are capable of is something to be ashamed of.

So what happens to the boys and men who aren’t good at sports, or don’t think about sex 24/7? Who are more interested in the arts?  Or those who are gay? What about the ones who want to break the “bro code” because they believe justice needs to be brought to the situation? They get ostracized in many cases. They get called a wuss (and that’s the nice version). They feel as though they aren’t man enough, that there is something wrong with them. This is not the case, and the amount of women you sleep with does not determine your manhood.

We all have emotions, being emotional is part of being human. We need to pay attention to warning signs. The misconception that men don’t “feel” is hurting us as a whole. If you have boys and men in your life encourage them to find creative outlets, encourage conversations, let them know that you are willing to listen and truly do so. Encourage them to take of the mask of masculinity and embrace their humanity.

1163,266,"Ihr kennt sie, die ewige Frage: Was ziehe ich heute an? Schön, dass sich so viele Männer genau darüber lustig machen, wo sie doch ein großer Teil des Problems seid. Trägt eine Frau einen kurzen Rock oder ein knappes Top auf der Straße, lassen die Reaktionen oft nicht lang auf sich warten: Von Beschimpfungen über Maßregelungen bis hin zu unangemessenen Anmachsprüchen – viele von uns erleben all das. JAJA das mag nicht immer so sein, die Häufigkeit lässt mich aber an einer Zufalls-Theorie zweifeln.

Unsere ach so tolerante Gesellschaft kämpft an der Front für Gleichberechtigung, für Selbstliebe und den beschissenen Weltfrieden, rollt aber immer noch heimlich mit den Augen bei einer Frau mit zu tiefem Ausschnitt. Zu kurzem Rock. 
Diese generelle Sexualisierung des weiblichen Körpers kotzt mich gelinde gesagt an. Ich liebe meine Brüste, warum sollte ich die immer hinter T-Shirts verstecken, nur weil sich das Gros der Männer nicht benehmen kann. Und wenn ich noch einmal Sprüche höre wie: „Du bist doch selber schuld, wenn du angemacht/ angeglotzt/ begrapschst oder vergewaltigt wirst, zieh Dich halt nicht so aufreizend an“ höre – dann zünde ich alles an.

Und wisst Ihr was? Ich zieh jetzt einfach an was ich mag – pfeife Bauarbeitern, die oben ohne arbeiten lautstark hinterher. Begrapsche Männer in kurzen Hosen und Sprüche wie „Na Schnucki, wie viel kosten Du und Dein Maurer-Dekolleté denn?“ gehören ab sofort zu meinem täglichen Sprachgebrauch.

1168,271,"Just to clarify, because it’s 2019 and some dudes still didn’t get the memo. A woman’s naked body is not instantly sexual or pornographic, it does not exist for your pleasure. You can be sexually attracted to it and that’s cool, does she need you to tell her that? no, really she doesn’t. Spoiler alert, we know you want to fuck us, we’re trying to ignore and avoid it most of the time. Dicks are everywhere, we can catch one whenever we like when we chose. Seeing your dick in our DMs is tired, old, and boring, it isn’t enticing or attractive, sorry to break that to you. when you send us a picture of your dick we’re not impressed or turned on, we instantly think you’re a misogynistic turd with no self respect or control, and we really don’t care what you think of our bodies. You’re just a creep forcing a woman to look at your penis. Imagine, you’re in work and you call a female co worker into your office then just show her your genitals! You’d be sent right to HR and you’d know why, it’s a sexual harassment power play and it’s gross. I post nudes because I like my body and the aesthetic and I appreciate feeling good in my own skin, not to be fuckable, not to be harassed, not for male attention.

Those that really wanna call themselves Christians should practice what they preach. Ephesians 4:29 - “get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, malice and slander...forgiving each other.

Admettons qu'ils n'en soient pas les responsables direct, pour autant, ce n'était ni le bon moment, ni la bonne technique pour tirer son épingle du jeu..
Se poser en ""victime"", face à de vraies victimes étaient vraiment très maladroit et pas empathique.
C'était un total manque de conscience de son ""privilège d'homme"".
Ce que je nomme ""privilège d'homme"", c'est ce qu'il a vécu, certainement inconsciemment, en tant qu'homme dans une société patriarcale.

Just wanting to go out for a walk without the fear of getting abducted,
Or go out without my bra and not see literally every man ogle at my breasts
Be in a workspace without having to constantly squirm away from unwanted touches.
Is it too much to ask for you to keep your hands off me while i am passed out,
Or not shout profanities from across the street,
Or touch me in a hustling crowd.
Is it really asking too much if i we ask you to take some responsibility for your actions.
Stop your friends from demeaning that one girl who refused to sleep with him.
Don’t make her a slut. She is not. You are just imcompetent, afraid that you’ll lose your potentially rapist friends.
So scared they’ll think you are a pussy.
All you're doing is giving him validation to ignore my no next time.
All you are doing is letting him know that you support his actions.
You can’t just wash your hands off the blood of the innocent girls you could have saved just by stopping your friend that one time he made a rape joke.
Or that one time he whistled at the girl walking down the street and told you how he would like to bang her little ass.
Stop defending toxic masculine characters and whine about how girls are no longer complacent to your wishes.
Is it really too much of a problem for you to be decent? I know it's not all men, 
But why do you fail to understand that when you are a bystander in a heinous crime you could have stopped,
You are no longer innocent.
 It’s not all men, no. But it’s enough men for every girl to think twice before stepping out.
It’s enough men for every 4 in 5 girls to get assaulted.
It’s enough men for every girl to feel not safe enough in their own homes.
It’s just not enough men speaking out against others, not enough men looking out for girls, calling out their friends when they say sexist shit, not enough men taking some fucking responsibilty.

Thank you to all men who send me dickpics, insult messages, sexual messages, etc... 🙏

My study file is ready and I can continue working with the police 👍
It was really fascinating to watch how easy you fall in a trap with few keywords.

Just a word: those last five days show me how discusting you are. No matter to come with your #NotAllMen, you are disgusting. I already know it, of course, but usually, I bloc, deleate or ignore without thinking of it, I don't screenshot it. You, who tell me you want to fuck me because of my fat ass, you, who tell me you wan't to lick me, to make me dirty things, you, who talk to me and try to make me believe that you never do that to women usually: you are disgusting.

Why coming to women private messages and tell them those things and send them your penis ? I really don't understand what it makes to you. You really enjoy it ? Oo

In only 5 days, with a few keywords, I got so many many different things you can't imagine. I send them to few of my clothest friends and they didn't believe it. THIS is my reality.

THIS is the reality of too much women.

And this is not ""harassment"". This is just some *insert insults here please* people who are looking for... What, actually ? I don't want to imagine the life of those who receive thousand of messages a day. Don't want. Just want to share them love and protect them. Can't wait the moment when a dickpic or an insult could break anonymous to send you in jail. 
I want you to realize people can be terrified by your words. People can die because of your words. Instead of your dirty notallmen, act normally.

You do not deserve any cookie.",notallmen,|Je ne peux pas imaginer à quel point ça a été dur et quel courage celà t'a demandé de vivre ces derniers jours. Immense respect et j'espère que le but de cet expérience permettra au moins une prise de conscience pour certain.e.s,42

Desde hace décadas, las mujeres musulmanas estamos oprimidas. Pero no por nuestra religión, como muchos piensan, sino por aquellas personas de mayoría hombres no musulmanes que creen tener el poder de decidir sobre nosotras. 
Y eso han demostrado cuando nos han prohibido ir al Instituto con Hijab en Madrid, cuando no nos han dejado entrar a las piscinas públicas con Burkini o cuando nos han hachado del trabajo por vestir libremente. 
Otra vez la “justicia” machista y patriarcal ha vuelto a hacer de las suyas. Pero que sepan que no nos vamos a callar, que conocemos nuestros derechos y vamos a luchar para que se normalize que una mujer quiera o no enseñar su cuerpo. 🚫Los comentarios ofensivos serán eliminados🚫

For decades, Muslim women have been oppressed. Not because of our religion, as many people think, but because of the majority of non-Muslim men who believe that they have the power to decide about us.

And they have shown that again by not allowing us to go to High School with Hijab in Madrid, by not allowing us to enter public pools with Burkini and by firing us for dress freely. 
Once again the sexist and patriarchal ""justice"" made it. But we are not going to be silent, we know our rights and we are going to fight so that women can show or not her body without consequences. 🚫Offensive comments will be deleted🚫

1222,26,"TRIGGER WARNING

Kabir Singh has been in the news for the wrong reasons anyway.

The director has now found himself in a wave of controversy, after his visibly dumb statements made in his recent interview.

To put in a very lucid manner - Man abusing woman is wrong. Woman abusing a man is wrong. Don't even try debating this. Got it? Good.

Humans function on power and money. The root of all things somehow finds itself linked to these two elements. Abuse and treating women like trash is deep-rooted in the obsessive need for power and control.

The movie was probably 'okay' to exist before, but NOW, after the director's bold judgments and justifications, the movie should stop ceasing because it normalizes everything that women do NOT deserve. 
If you support Reddy, you probably are the same species who irks at 'All Men Are Trash', and use a lot of 'Not All Men'. Please change. It's never too late. There is always a choice.

Go figure!

Some examples are In cold blood, fight club, even game of thrones challenged our notions of good and bad, right and wrong. I don’t think the purpose of making a movie should be presenting a PC message or to present any kind of propaganda good or bad.. it should be to tell a story as truthfully and as honestly  as possible as the writer or director deems it so.

💜 My hair color is Extreme Purple or Purple with Brown Hair from @overtonecolor. Yes, you’ll need to bleach it first if you want vibrant results, but the PWBH gives even dark brown hair a nice purple tint (especially in natural light) without bleaching first.
🛍 That thing you like that I posted? It’s either from Target or Amazon.
🥘 I post food a lot because I love cooking. I don’t claim to be a  professional chef. If what I made looks gross to you, keep it to yourself.
👩‍👧‍👧 My kids, Ava and Eli, are 10 and 7, at least until September. They’re not on the show much because I usually film when they are not with me, since that’s primarily when I socialize.
👨🏻I post a lot of screenshots of shitty dudes from my online dating experiences. They’re not all like that (if you’re a good guy, I DO know you exist and it’s #notallmen) but it’s a fair representation of what it’s like. I black out their photos and screen names because I get accused of online bullying if I don’t.
📺 No, I don’t know when the show will be back. When I know I’ll share.
🤷🏻‍♀️Sometimes I am self-deprecating. As much as it’s appreciated, you don’t have to comment letting me know how great I am or how my prince will come eventually. It’s (probably) being said in jest. But not always—I’m pretty open with my struggles.
⌨️I try to answer questions in the comments, but check to see if someone else has already asked, and please don’t hate me if I don’t respond.
🌊 Yes, I’ll be on the #NoBSatSea cruise. It’s my birthday that week and you should totally come celebrate with me.

1233,37,"Caro,

Credo non ci sia una frase peggiore del 'grazie di tutto, ma ora ti vedo come amico'. Qui non si tratta della mitologica friendzone che qualche #notallmen vorrebbe ancora usare contro noi donne. Qui si tratta di educazione sentimentale di base. Sono parole che feriscono inutilmente, quindi perché dirle? 
Può essere che nel tuo caso particolare sia proprio una questione anagrafica, il ragazzo è giovane quindi si confonde facilmente. Beh no, questa è una stronzata. Non è mai un problema di età. Quando io ero una ventenne furiosa sapevo benissimo quello che volevo: collezionare esperienze, collezionare maschi alti, biondi e più grandi di me. E lo facevo senza fermarmi mai per chiedermi: ma loro che cosa vogliono?

Ero crudele? Forse, però era il mio modo di sentirmi finalmente corporea, di scoprire cose su di me che fino a quel momento avevo evitato. Il ragazzo che stavi frequentando probabilmente non avrà motivi tanto filosofici per comportarsi male. Forse è solo stronzo. Forse più che te, gli piaceva l'idea di se stesso che vedeva riflessa nei tuoi sguardi per lui.

Ma in fondo, chissenefrega? Non siamo qui per psicanalizzare giovani amanti della poesia. So che hai una passione particolare per questi piccoli friky, ma magari dovresti dare una chance ai 'fashion blogger milanesi isterici'.

1250,54,"How to unmask toxic masculinity?

Society tells us to “be a man”, that men are strong and have to provide and protect. This is a huge weight on their shoulders. If they feel as though they are not doing these things that add up to being a man, they feel as though they have failed. In media especially, there are only a few type of men shown. And the ones who express more emotions are looked at to be weak. We have the womanizer, superhero, good, all-star athlete and in many of these stories, sexual conquests play a large role.

An example used is the saying “you play like a girl” when as little boy was asked how he would feel if a coach said this to him, he responded, “I would feel destroyed.” We are teaching them to think what girls are capable of is something to be ashamed of.

So what happens to the boys and men who aren’t good at sports, or don’t think about sex 24/7? Who are more interested in the arts?  Or those who are gay? What about the ones who want to break the “bro code” because they believe justice needs to be brought to the situation? They get ostracized in many cases. They get called a wuss (and that’s the nice version). They feel as though they aren’t man enough, that there is something wrong with them. This is not the case, and the amount of women you sleep with does not determine your manhood.

We all have emotions, being emotional is part of being human. We need to pay attention to warning signs. The misconception that men don’t “feel” is hurting us as a whole. If you have boys and men in your life encourage them to find creative outlets, encourage conversations, let them know that you are willing to listen and truly do so. Encourage them to take of the mask of masculinity and embrace their humanity.

1255,59,"Ihr kennt sie, die ewige Frage: Was ziehe ich heute an? Schön, dass sich so viele Männer genau darüber lustig machen, wo sie doch ein großer Teil des Problems seid. Trägt eine Frau einen kurzen Rock oder ein knappes Top auf der Straße, lassen die Reaktionen oft nicht lang auf sich warten: Von Beschimpfungen über Maßregelungen bis hin zu unangemessenen Anmachsprüchen – viele von uns erleben all das. JAJA das mag nicht immer so sein, die Häufigkeit lässt mich aber an einer Zufalls-Theorie zweifeln.

Unsere ach so tolerante Gesellschaft kämpft an der Front für Gleichberechtigung, für Selbstliebe und den beschissenen Weltfrieden, rollt aber immer noch heimlich mit den Augen bei einer Frau mit zu tiefem Ausschnitt. Zu kurzem Rock. 
Diese generelle Sexualisierung des weiblichen Körpers kotzt mich gelinde gesagt an. Ich liebe meine Brüste, warum sollte ich die immer hinter T-Shirts verstecken, nur weil sich das Gros der Männer nicht benehmen kann. Und wenn ich noch einmal Sprüche höre wie: „Du bist doch selber schuld, wenn du angemacht/ angeglotzt/ begrapschst oder vergewaltigt wirst, zieh Dich halt nicht so aufreizend an“ höre – dann zünde ich alles an.

Und wisst Ihr was? Ich zieh jetzt einfach an was ich mag – pfeife Bauarbeitern, die oben ohne arbeiten lautstark hinterher. Begrapsche Männer in kurzen Hosen und Sprüche wie „Na Schnucki, wie viel kosten Du und Dein Maurer-Dekolleté denn?“ gehören ab sofort zu meinem täglichen Sprachgebrauch.

Freiheit für die Brüste, die Ärsche und die Bäuche dieser Nation – Raus mit Euch, Ihr seid wunderschön! 🖤",notallmen,"|#libertéégalitédécolleté #jekiffemondecollete #feminismus #feminist #gedanken #instatext #frausein #tragwasduliebst #notallmen #jaja #schreiben #gedankenmachen #woman #women #freetheboobsmovement #instawomen #instafeminism #everydaysexism #kunterbuntstattnurdabei|🖤🖤🖤🖤|❤️🙌 preach it|🙌🏻🖤🖤🖤|Isso 👌🏻|Word! ❤|Toll geschrieben!❤️|Sehr geil und aus meinem tiefsten Herzen geschrieben! ♥️Danke 😘|Ja richtig so, du sprichst mir aus der Seele👍🏻|YES.

1256,60,It seemed like a win for women and victims of sexual assault when @montymonsterslayer did a collaboration to tell her story on a billboard. It seemed the #NotAllMen advocates might have found 1 good champion for their outcries. However @trustyscribe the male artist and owner of this somewhat piddly @amightyforce art initiative is selling another person’s rape for $35k on the sly. Anyone who would think to purchase this would surely be motivated by good intentions and solidarity with @montymonsterslayer and women in general. Don’t be fooled. Get the word out. This is a violation and an act of violence against a woman who has already been the victim of rape. Now a victim of a profiteer who has seen fit to monetise HER trauma. This is not ok.

1261,65,"Just to clarify, because it’s 2019 and some dudes still didn’t get the memo. A woman’s naked body is not instantly sexual or pornographic, it does not exist for your pleasure. You can be sexually attracted to it and that’s cool, does she need you to tell her that? no, really she doesn’t. Spoiler alert, we know you want to fuck us, we’re trying to ignore and avoid it most of the time. Dicks are everywhere, we can catch one whenever we like when we chose. Seeing your dick in our DMs is tired, old, and boring, it isn’t enticing or attractive, sorry to break that to you. when you send us a picture of your dick we’re not impressed or turned on, we instantly think you’re a misogynistic turd with no self respect or control, and we really don’t care what you think of our bodies. You’re just a creep forcing a woman to look at your penis. Imagine, you’re in work and you call a female co worker into your office then just show her your genitals! You’d be sent right to HR and you’d know why, it’s a sexual harassment power play and it’s gross. I post nudes because I like my body and the aesthetic and I appreciate feeling good in my own skin, not to be fuckable, not to be harassed, not for male attention.

I was ostracized from a church a few years ago because they found out I was gay. I couldn’t talk to anyone and felt alone and helpless. I had a great expectation of forgiving them when they couldn’t even forgive me. That right there is a pure example of a hypocrite. Hell, the Bible itself is contradictory. Those that really wanna call themselves Christians should practice what they preach. Ephesians 4:29 - “get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, malice and slander...forgiving each other. Just as in Christ, God forgave you.” You can’t preach hate and love simultaneously and expect to enter Heaven. In due time, we will reap what we have sown.

(Qui a aussi, j'espère, permis à certains hommes de constater l'ampleur du problème) Certains hommes souhaitaient se sortir du lot, car ils ne se sentaient pas responsable de tous ces actes.
Admettons qu'ils n'en soient pas les responsables direct, pour autant, ce n'était ni le bon moment, ni la bonne technique pour tirer son épingle du jeu..
Se poser en ""victime"", face à de vraies victimes étaient vraiment très maladroit et pas empathique.
C'était un total manque de conscience de son ""privilège d'homme"".
Ce que je nomme ""privilège d'homme"", c'est ce qu'il a vécu, certainement inconsciemment, en tant qu'homme dans une société patriarcale. Pour ne donner qu'un exemple, il n'a jamais été agressé sexuellement, ""sous prétexte"" de sa tenue.. Ce qui arrive tous les jours à un grand nombre de femmes.. Mais ce n'est qu'un exemple, il y en à tellement d'autres.

Reflect on how you feel after your media hiatus 🏝
🤔 Do you think that there was content that you have been consuming that has been impacting you in a negative way - making you feel unworthy, or less than, or critical of your body?
☁️ I know for me, seeing my IG feed with images of beautiful women caused me to feel extreme insecurity about my face. This lead me to spend thousands of dollars injecting Botox and fillers into my face, so I could feel beautiful.  We are bombarded with images daily which can make us feel like we are not enough. We are not pretty enough. We are not thin enough. Our eyes are too small, our noses too wide, our waists too large, our hip dips too dippy, our eyebrows too thin, our skin too dark, our skin too light, our teeth too yellow, our boobs too small, our hair too dry, our lips too thin, our eyelashes too sparse, our bums too flat. I’m sick of not feeling enough and then too much of anything else.
📝 IG prompt: Unfollow anyone on social media that talks about sneaky diet culture or makes you feel bad about your face or body. That might even be me 🤗 Put yourself first. Always.

I had to unfollow you and probably almost all of the people I “looked up too” because it became to much of a fad...BUT this is by no means to bash. But to say THANK YOU for waking up (not in a negative way) and realizing that to hell with these people who want to body shame just for a like..it’s soooo not worth it. Mental health trumps all.

Absolutely loving what you’re doing 💖|I love you 💙|Yes! No one should feel less than because of someone else. We should only be trying to be better than who we were yesterday and even that sometimes is unnecessary.  The way i see it is if you want something like this done that's fine. But my wish is that it's not to make you look like someone else or because of someone else. Nothing wrong with saying hey I love myself but I'd really like to have idk fuller lips or longer lashes. We just have to remember not to go over board. Plus some days we will be all about the natural beauty in us and say no to cosmetic surgery and then maybe one day a year later we will feel differently and that's okay too. We can change our minds like and dislike things then like them again lol. My point is whatever makes you happy in the mindset you're in is fine. We are constantly changing and evolving and what might have been great for us and our self esteem one day might no longer serve a purpose another. I think you are amazing and adore you. I'm trying to get back in the gym. I've had 2 months of straight hell and been feeling pretty down so hopefully I'll find the motivation soon. But you are definitely the one person who does give me motivation , so thank you.|Vc não precisa disto|U thought ur eyes were too ""squinty"" even tho the sun was shining right in ur eyes in that pic making u squint lol.

Glad I got the pleasure to you xx|People are so weak minded|way better without the  Botox and fillers.|I just had a question because I’m still trying to grasp the concept of what message you’re spreading. If I like the way my body looks and the way I feel as a smaller person, does that make me fatphobic? I’m not trying to lose or gain any weight, if anything I’m working on getting stronger and working out for my own benefit. I’m not the healthiest person in the world, but I tend to eat whatever makes me feel good. I don’t like to eat or drink a lot of sugary things, mainly because it makes me feel sick. Is this diet culture?|...so what? You’re supposed to close your eyes walking around outside all the time? The fact is someone will always be prettier than you, skinnier, fitter, have x and y that you don’t have. Instead of trying to minimize exposure, which you can never completely get rid of, how about become mentally strong and not let it affect you. Ignoring the problem (like unfollowing people on social media) is only a bandaid to the deeper mental issue/insecurities you have. The answer shouldn’t be to ignore everyone you’re envious of (because that will ALWAYS exist), but to learn to embrace yourself.|Horrible|P.s.

If I see one image that doesn’t sit right with me, I unfollow straight away.|There are a lot of fitness profiles who are posting in order to encourage other people to exercise and eat well in order to be HEALTHY and feel confident. Not just to “look good”. It’s very easy to get caught up in social media—yes. But personally, if you do, it’s your own fault. Not the fault of the Instagramer (usually—I guess some people can just be trying to sell you something). Most people are genuinely trying to inspire others to take care of themselves—mentally and physically. And insecurities that come from that are completely the follower’s responsibility. It’s important to be happy with yourself and not want to be like other people, but it’s also important to take care of your body!|No botox u look better|Unfollow!!!!!|You were fine before.

It’s so easy for our self image to become distorted when scrolling through our Instagram feeds and constantly being inundated with pictures of women who’s faces, bodies, and personas aren’t real.

Please keep the educational posts coming. I’ve been weaning down on the Botox and filler because I hated the way it changed my face, I overfilled at one stage and i looked evil. Plus I got all these weird lumps and had it all dissolved. I admit I recently got relaxers and only a small amount of lip filler, but I’m becoming more aware of what I’m actually doing to my body..|Dont like, natural is better|You didn’t even need it🤷🏾‍♂️😍|Why even do it?

It's not the same for men. That's probably why most don't understand. Also their is a lot of ppl on the Internet that are unhappy with themselves and see some one beautiful like yourself and your friends and want to put you down in some way to make themselves feel better. Only way to win against them is to unfollow them. 😁|Content|❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|Wait, you use Botox? I will unfollow if so|Gurl, you were a honey to begin with.

Girl, I NEVER leave comments but I love you for doing this. You look so much healthier without it and your face has like, a radiant glow. I’m not religious but it’s like I literally can feel your soul more on the left than the right and I think it’s because the thoughts and pressures behind the Botox culture is really hurtful for your soul (or whatever you want to call it). This is a fad I really wish would disappear from the Earth forever. If signs of aging are something people want to get rid of then they should do that with methods of self LOVE (eating healthy, collagen, lowering stress, etc.) and not self HATE (Botox/fillers). You rock, keep doing what you’re doing and influence this world to have self love instead!!|You hit 1m followers being natural I’m actually disappointed|Juicy lips|No botox 😍|Beautiful in both pics 😍|I’ve followed you for years! I just wanted to thank you for being you in all stages of your life and being real! You’re such a beautiful person inside & out 💛💛|I believe that the medical industry profits off of women's insecurities. And it's nice to see that you were able to and break the cycle to see yourself as beautiful. I think the big difference between the photos is an insecure person and a confident person. I think there is nothing more beautiful than a confident woman. 👏|So dieting is bad?|You look really nice in both but without fillers and Botox you was already very beautiful, social media ruins people :( you should be god damn confident 😘😘😘|Great and honest post, be proud of yourself 🙂|You're beautiful either way. Do what makes you happy ❤️|Eres más linda sin botox|You’re beautiful... so so beautiful. Inside and out💕|I'm all for this, but I think (personal opinion, it's okay if you disagree) that we need to stop telling women that they should/have the right to feel beautiful. You should feel, proud, compassionate, empowered, motivated, intelligent, safe, educated... BUT A WOMANS CONFIDENCE DOES NOT HAVE TO COME FROM HER LOOKS! If you do feel beautiful then that's great and it's your business what(if) you take/inject/put on to achieve that, but if you're not into it/aren't satisfied then just remember that there are about a hundred other things to love aswell. 💕|you’re beautiful no matter what! but i’m glad to see you going back natural💛|demasiados morros ... 🍑🍌💦💦|😢|@madalingiorgetta I’ve done this and lost friendships over it... guess they weren’t real friends in the first place if all they cared about was how many followers they had... 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️|I know you’re scared about letting your Botox and fillers dissolve but truly you are beautiful without them.|hello I much prefer without botox, you are too much in kind 💋👍|Spent all that money and I don't even really see a difference.

Sometimes I feel as though it goes over their head, and they somehow think that their opinion on how you look is important and that they’re doing a great thing by telling you that they prefer the natural look and that that’s what they prefer on a woman. It really irks me sometimes. I hope I make sense in how I’m wording this.|Without for me !!!|beautiful💘|Women as gorgeous as you don’t have the right to talk about how to feel good about yourself.....hahaha easy for you to say you’re a beautiful star!

I try to celebrate every beautiful girl/boy/you name it, I don't care because in my opinion we should support and lift each other up.. just don't feel sad about yourself, feel happy for others..

Amazing!!❤️❤️❤️|You always look beautiful 😍😍😍|I unfollow all day every day! Completely ruthless about it, if it makes me feel like garbage I don’t want to see it!!|Reread what you wrote and notice you use the word “feel” a lot. Guess, for a lot of people “feeling beautiful” is more important than actually being beautiful. Feeling is such a subjective thing that a person who is not considered beautiful by society’s standards can actually feel beautiful, because feeling beautiful is an internal reality of the one who feels, and not the objective reality of the world. I wrote a quote a while back: “we are not only responsible for what we do, but also what we think and feel.” Cheers 🥂|Hey, I commended on your previous post but you turned off the comment section. I would love an answer to my question. 
When I first discovered you years ago on YouTube, you were talking about health and fitness in the opposite way to the way you are now. Looking back, it was evident your views were quite distorted/ restrictive (and unfortunately they impacted me)
I love the change in direction but it seems like you’ve gone from 0-100 really fast. Was this a sudden realisation or something that happened gradually?

Jusqu’à présent, pour changer les couches de son bébé dans un lieu public, c’était très simple : il suffisait d’être une femme. Pendant longtemps en effet, on pensait que seules les femmes étaient capables de nettoyer le caca enfantin, grâce à la puissance cosmique de leur utérus magique. Et puis les hommes sont devenus de plus en plus perfectionnés (#notallmen), et les pères savent désormais changer les couches eux aussi, car des scientifiques américains se sont rendus compte qu’il suffisait en fait d’avoir deux mains… Le problème, c’est que la plupart des toilettes pour hommes ne sont toujours pas équipés de tables à langer parce que dans les esprits les plus préhistoriques, le caca enfantin reste un truc de meufs, un peu comme le rose, la bienveillance ou le féminisme. Alors les papas étaient obligés de changer leurs enfants dans le coffre de leur voiture ou sur leurs genoux, en position de squats. Jusqu’à ce @pampersus et ses couches pleines de PCB et de dioxine s’associe avec Koala Care pour installer 5000 tables à langer dans les toilettes pour hommes aux Etats-Unis et au Canada ! (5000, soit à peine de quoi équiper la moitié des Starbucks de Manhattan, mais bon…) Et là je me dis, whaouh, on a inventé la tondeuse intelligente et la voiture qui se conduit toute seule AVANT d’installer des change-couches dans les chiottes des mecs… Le progrès n’avance pas à la même vitesse sur tous les fronts, hein ? 😐

1310,114,"BOOK REVIEW!
I'm so super excited to be part of the book review tour for 'Our Stop' which is a fabulous new book by the awesome @laurajaneauthor !
This is not your stereotypical boy meets girl chick lit...this is an innovative, modern day 'Sliding Doors' style chick lit where you follow the #OurStop journey with Daniel and Nadia. It is brutally funny (particularly the part about #notallmen which had me snorting my drink - you'll have to read it to get it!) whilst also being brutally real and not shying away from serious topics such as consent, bereavement & emotional literacy. This is a fabulous book for romantics AND cynics which is the perfect read for 2019! Roll on Laura's next book!

1314,118,"I'm not posting this because I feel cute. I don't. I just want the men who follow me to know what I'm dressed like when I get harrassed on the street while walking my dog at 2pm on a Monday. I purposely wear a bra because God forbid a man sees the outline of a nipple and thinks I'm *really* asking for it. Seriously. I wish you all could understand what it feels like to walk out of your house and feel like your value is instantly stripped of anything you have to offer intellectually or emotionally, and solely lies in how hard you can make someone's dick. Its dehumanizing. Its demoralizing. And it's every single day. 
I shouldnt have to feel this way. I should feel like the men in my community feel a duty to protect me from predators, not that they are predators. But I don't. Instead I feel like men, yes, men in general, have lost the sense of honor, dignity, and pride that I expected that they would innately choose over selfishness, fear, and egotism. And as a woman I feel alone. Alone and tired. 
Tired of being vigilant. Tired of being on alert. Tired of avoiding eye contact. Tired of being honked at and yelled at from cars. Tired of hushed vile mummerings under breath when I'm passed on the street. Tired of intent silent stares and ""hellos"" shouted at my back. Tired of having to decompress and regroup everytime just to get back to a state of normalcy to try and go about my day. Tired of feeling like I'm ""brave"" for being independent and not showing fear when I live my life. 
But I live in fear. Because I don't trust you guys anymore. I don't trust your common decency or your willingness to ostracize one of ""your own"" even when he's done wrong. And I hate that I feel this way. But this is what it's come to because time and again it seems like y'all won't come get ya boys. I live with the defeated awareness that most of you won't hold eachother accountable because you don't hold yourselves accountable to begin with. 
I don't know how to change this. All I can do is share this vulnerability and the truth about how I feel. That I am heartbroken to feel so disappointed by the men in my life and in this culture. Please, I'm asking you to do better.",notallmen,"|#tired #tiredofthebullshit #sickofit #feelingdefeated #isthisfeminism #notallmen #makeitstop #streetharrassment #goodmen #jaded #cynical|I’m so very sorry you (and virtually every other woman I know) experience this constantly. I’m with you- that we need to destroy this toxic masculinity once and for all, as it does nothing but hurt everyone in its path. I’m so sorry- we all need to be better allies.|♥️|I hear you 💙 hope your male community does too!|I’m sorry. I know this experience too well. Respect to you for posting about it.|Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this. I think that firsthand stories and feelings are one of the most powerful ways that we can raise awareness and destroy things like toxic masculinity. I hope that, as men like myself see this, we will be reminded of the harmful norms that exist and be reminded that we must take action each and every day. We must proactively seek to call out unacceptable behavior and support positive behavior. We must do better. All of us. All the time.|Thank you for this caption. Your words seemed to be mirroring what my heart had trouble with formulating so clearly and gracefully. 👭❤️|Erin, I am a man.  I like boobs and tend to look at them.  I don’t consider myself a predator.  In fact, I am quite a champion of women being a friend, a brother, a son and a father of a woman.  All women I respect dearly.  But facts are facts, if I saw you walking your dog I would give you an awkward smile followed by silence cause I would be met with a displeasing frown!  Yes....many men are straight up dicks.  But it is going to be woman’s strength, courage, fearlessness, and tenacity that make the world a more balanced existence.  Do not leave this up to men.  We have already let you down for millions of years.  Be proud to go braless.  Be diligent that you are not an object.  Don’t be afraid to call someone out on their bullshit at 2pm.....2am keep that shit to yourself for now and just keep walking;-). You are an incredibly brave woman.  Use your platform to unite and project a positive future.  One where the young women growing up today feel strength!  I am doing my best to teach my daughter to be the CEO of herself.  Fearless, courageous, SMART....yet kind and empathetic! “Own you”.|Lmao boo hoo who cares",37
1315,119,"Early on Saturday morning I was walking through Central London on my way to teach a yoga class. It was 8am, the sun was shining, I was listening to my favourite podcast, I had a great weekend planned out and I was heading to teach in the most beautiful space I’ve ever taught in. Life felt pretty sweet.
.
I went to cross the road and then stopped as I saw a van approaching. The van slowed down to let me cross. I smiled and thanked him and carried on. Then I realised that the van was still behind me. Driving slowly. The driver had rolled down his window and was shouting at me. I took out my headphones, thinking he must be asking for directions, “Get in, I’ll take you wherever you want to go.” “Ummm no thanks.” I put my headphones back in. .
He kept following me. For 2 whole blocks. For an eternity he crept behind me at a snails pace shouting out of his window. There was no one on the street. Panic started to trickle through my veins like liquid ice. A sensation familiar to all women. I started planning escape routes and fighting moves in my head, us girls are well versed in them, we’ve all rehearsed them from a young age.
. “Is it what I’m wearing?” I ask and immediately hate myself a little for the thought even entering my mind. I’m wearing yoga leggings, a baggy T-Shirt and a denim jacket. It’s 8am. Central London. I’m wearing fucking workout clothes and I’m on my way to work.
.
The road becomes one-way and he’s forced to turn left. I breathe a sigh of relief. “But what if he drives round the block and comes back the other way?” “If I walk quickly I’ll be able to round the corner before him,” I calculate.
.
Why am I sharing this story? It’s not because it’s unusual or shocking but precisely because it’s not. Every woman has experienced this or worse. Every woman has planned escape routes whilst walking home after a night out or thought about what they would do if someone attacked them (swipe right.) And yet, every time I talk to men about this, they shake their heads and say they would never do anything like that. That they don’t know anyone who would do anything like that. Well, something just isn’t adding up & I call bullshit! (Cont. in comments)",notallmen,"|Men, you have to do better. Be better. You have to hold each other accountable. This has to end.

1316,120,"Jusqu’à présent, pour changer les couches de son bébé dans un lieu public, c’était très simple : il suffisait d’être une femme. Pendant longtemps en effet, on pensait que seules les femmes étaient capables de nettoyer le caca enfantin, grâce à la puissance cosmique de leur utérus magique. Et puis les hommes sont devenus de plus en plus perfectionnés (#notallmen), et les pères savent désormais changer les couches eux aussi, car des scientifiques américains se sont rendus compte qu’il suffisait en fait d’avoir deux mains… Le problème, c’est que la plupart des toilettes pour hommes ne sont toujours pas équipés de tables à langer parce que dans les esprits les plus préhistoriques, le caca enfantin reste un truc de meufs, un peu comme le rose, la bienveillance ou le féminisme. Alors les papas étaient obligés de changer leurs enfants dans le coffre de leur voiture ou sur leurs genoux, en position de squats. Jusqu’à ce @pampersus et ses couches pleines de PCB et de dioxine s’associe avec Koala Care pour installer 5000 tables à langer dans les toilettes pour hommes aux Etats-Unis et au Canada ! (5000, soit à peine de quoi équiper la moitié des Starbucks de Manhattan, mais bon…) Et là je me dis, whaouh, on a inventé la tondeuse intelligente et la voiture qui se conduit toute seule AVANT d’installer des change-couches dans les chiottes des mecs… Le progrès n’avance pas à la même vitesse sur tous les fronts, hein ? 😐

Du coup, j'ai exigé de lui qu'il s'occupe de son bain ( sinon il n'aurait rien fait). A 7 ans, c'est toujours lui qui s'en occupe.

Pour deux raisons: d'abord parce que les WC hommes sont en général des pissotières sans portes et qu'il ne veut pas que son bébé voit des pénis partout et ensuite car il ne veut pas que la table a langer soit a proximité de ces pissotières pour des raisons d'hygiène. Au moins chez les femmes, les tables à langer sont éloignées des projections d'urine. Bref l'idéal c'est la table a langer à l'extérieur des WCs adultes.",2101
1317,121,"This has been a good weekend, I made up with an old, old friend after a year( he and I have known each other for over 2 decades). We fell out over something that was extremely personal to me so I had cut off all ties and to be fair to him he let me go with no explanations at all. I initiated conversation a couple of months ago to explain why I reacted so virulently to his opinion on said issue. I think he realized how badly I’d been hurt and he did me the courtesy of listening to me without interrupting or mansplaining or saying #notallmen We have since communicated off and on and last night for the first time in a year I felt a certain level of comfort when speaking to him. This afternoon I had a loooong conversation with Jovi @rhubarbbear and we discussed our respective marriages and child rearing styles. I wish we lived closer to each other.

1320,124,"Are you ready for a vaguely #feminist rant? .
Yesterday, walking to my car to head back to dinner and night out at the MNU Body Composition Residential (dressed exactly like this... not bad for a 15 minute turnaround time 💁🏼‍♀️) I encountered a group of lads.... maybe about 10 of them, probably a little older than me.
.
“Where are you going in that short skirt you little s**t”
.
Word for word.
.
In what situation is that behaviour acceptable?
.
But I’m really glad that it was me 🤷🏼‍♀️. I can handle it.
.
I can walk up to the main perpetrators and loudly embarrass them.
.
I can talk down to them and belittle them like they’re disgraced children.
.
I can leave the entire group somewhat lost for words.
.
It’s a shame that they’re shocked when somebody stands up to their actions.
.
But at the same time I fully understand why women don’t stand up to this kind of behaviour. 10 athletic looking lads vs me... I don’t fancy my chances. .
Did you know that around 35% of women have experienced some kind of violence or assault at the hands of a male?
.
(I should probably include here... #notallmen)
.
Statistics like that don’t really inspire women to stand up for themselves.
.
We’re (generally) physically smaller and weaker, we probably won’t come off better in a fight.
.
Rape culture should not be this normalised.
.
A skirt is not an invitation.

To avoid eye contact 
To flinch when touched
To a keep a knife handy
or keep pepper sprays
And when we speak up instead of muttering a few prays
We are deemed as ""bra burning feminazi""
But we just want equality
We want you to look at us 
Not as object, not as animals, not as toys that are yours to play with
But humans who deserve your respect
So please stop with your preaches
With your ""we gave you rights"" and ""not all men"" speeches
Because those rights were never meant to be taken away
And we have to go a long way
Because I don't want a fucking rape whistle
I want a changed world that safe for us
Because the words ""not all men"" don't mean anything genuine
Because we hear such stories that make most of us afraid to trust all men
Even the good ones
To whom I apologise for the generalizing
But right now
Those words for us not at all legit
Right now they are just utter and complete bullshit
And none of you men are trying anything to change this
these stories just prove it.

We’re good on silence and indifference.We’re good on skeptics and devil’s advocates and sympathizers for false accusations. Good on guilt and helplessness and the “Not All Men” responses, too. All topped up with those, in fact. 
What we need is some intense male disgust. Disgust at this behavior. You don’t even have to say you believe the allegations or take up the facts of the scenario. Merely expressing your disgust, in front of other men, that someone would ever do a thing like that - force sex onto someone, drug someone in order to force sex on them, take photos of unconscious women they’re forcing sex on - this is the response we need, guys. 
We need your disgust and revulsion at this behavior. We need you to express how antithetical it is to the act of sex. Your disgust means more to us than your promises of violence or your terror at this ever happening to your sister or wife or daughter. Your disgust towards the men who perpetrate these crimes is the only response that I can think of that might soothe me, and might also have any kind of power to change anything."" #whowrotethis -

1349,153,"Our second script-development #workshop took place in #Kathmandu at the end of November 2018. With us we had #theatre practitioners and veterans, visual and performance artists, and slam poets—many of whom have been working on #genderbasedviolence and the lives of women in different ways. 
The discussions were strongly influenced by the #NirmalaPant rape and murder case which has had #Nepal in a ferment since July. The participants drew parallels between the #impunity of the government in current democratic Nepal and the impunity of the royal family in the case of the #NamitaSunitahatyakando when Nepal was a constitutional monarchy, 37 years ago. Across a gulf of over thirty years, the same hush-up, mass #protests and no solution. 
We discussed how violence exists on a continuum—from the extreme #violence of #rape to the ordinariness of #streetharassment. 
This video has Yukta of @wordwarriorsnepal talking about #streetharassment, taking #publictransport and the tendency of male friends to react with #notallmen in a #metoo world. 
We'll be releasing more material from the workshop over the next few weeks so stay tuned for more #exitimpunity. 
In the meantime, tell us your thoughts on what Yukta says here. Do you also feel like anyone can be a harasser? If you're a man, how do you react to remarks like this? How do you feel about the continuous self-monitoring and self-regulation we often do as women occupying public space?

1353,157,"In my first year of college I became close friends with this group of people; it was me, 2 other girls and this one guy. At some point this guy and I became really good friends but it got to a point I started to feel super uncomfortable around him. At first it started with simple snapchats of “hey you’re a cutie” but then it got to a point where it went to unwanted shirtless photos of him and countless unwanted d*** pics from him. He even came up to me one day after sending one saying “Did you enjoy that last photo? You ain’t my type but I’d still f*** you!” I went to my so called friends and told them everything, and they didn’t believe me.... saying that he was such a sweet guy and that wasn’t like him. He proceeded to do the same to my best friend in the program after he realized that it wasn’t going to happen....
He’s now dating one of the girls who I thought was my friend and  she’s the one who told me I was lying.
I hated going to my classes cause I would have to see him everyday #submissions #itsjustajoke #notallmen #buthesSOsweet #sexualharassment #thecatcallcollective",notallmen,"|I’ve experienced something similar and felt very betrayed. It’s the hard way to learn who are your real friends. I know the mask will fall off at some point because they can’t wear them and pretend to be good for a long time. So whoever the abuser is with, he/she will get to experience it. But it’s not our business anymore because we got to move on and heal ourselves. It’s not the same as letting go/ forgiving. We just understand now there are manipulative ppl out there and we know better. Pass on the lesson to those who will listen, sis!",261
1354,158,"If short dresses and skirts cause rape, how does it explain the rape of those in sarees and burqas?
If rapes happen because of influence from western culture, how does that explain rapes in villages as punishments?
If rapes happen because girls roam around with guys freely, how does that explain rapes by relatives within the family?
If rapes happen because some girls are dressed provocatively, how does that explain the rape of toddlers and really old women?
The first task of the guilty is to blame the innocent. It's an almost perfect inversion of culpability. This is also how nonsense like #NotAllMen starts floating around. These have to be the silliest people on the planet, to make even an issue of women oppression about them. 'Yeah, you never molested a woman, here's your gold medal.'
We don't want to address the elephant in the room, which is ""How do we get our boys and men to respect women?""
Reflection is always important, more than anger or outrage, to arrive at solutions. Why hasn't anything changed from the last time we read about such an incident? Or the one before that? Or the one before?
I'll end quoting Amitabh Bachchan from PINK, ""Till today we all have given our efforts in the wrong direction, we should save our boys, not our girls, because if we save our boys then our girls will be safe"".

Hell no, it has drastically increased. They rape, they kill, they do vary the body parts, they dump.. and they take them away from their family who can’t even afford to fight for their kid.

Your gender makes you feel entitled to more and more of everything that we are taught to desire - the money, the status, the power. You scream #notallmen in the same breath that you limit women’s rights to control their own bodies. 
Your light skin makes you feel entitled to all verbal and physical spaces. You scream #alllivesmatter and “I don’t see colour” with no regard to the people feeling threatened by your presence, your colonisation, your exploitation. 
Your blonde hair makes you feel more entitled to a certain geographic area and the benefits of that area. You scream that the government should lower your taxes and say nothing about the government giving you subsidies when that brown lady cleans your home. 
Your clothes with special brands makes you feel entitled, you scream “pride” and “feminist” in March and June, but nothing about the brown and black lives making those clothes. 
Your education makes you feel entitled and superior, you scream when someone spells a word wrong but say nothing about giving everyone the same opportunities you had.

Sayangnya, Anda sbg admin terlalu mengeneralisasi kasus2 perkawinan campur. Coba ambil satu kasus spesifik, kemudian diteliti secara detail, mungkin Anda tdk akan dapat banyak backlash. Also, the fact that you call white men ""bule"" makes you racist yourself. Bule derives from Javanese word of ""bulai"" which literally means albino.|@tyahaans Excuse me... saya setuju, kalau misalnya harus ada kasus spesifik yang diteliti secara maksimal. Karena saya tau kalau mereka semua tidak seperti itu. Namun, saya ingin menyangkal mengenai sebutan ""bule"". Taukah Anda kalau yang pertama kali menciptakan kata tersebut adalah Orang Kulit Putih sendiri? Walaupun memang benar bila kata tersebut berasal dari kata ""Bulai"" dari Bahasa Jawa, namun, faktanya adalah bukanlah kita yang memulai menggunakan sebutan itu. Melainkan seseorang bernama Benedict Anderson, yang telah menciptakan kata tersebut sejak tahun 1960. Dan itupun, tak ada konotasi negatif yang ada dibalik sebutan tersebut. Beliau menciptakannya karena merasa tidak enak dengan kata ""Tuan"" yang sering digunakan pada masa itu.|Sebenernya saya gak ngerti tujuan account ini apa !! Mental yang punya akun pun bobrok !! Bilang bule rasis ? Postingan kamu jauh lebih rasis .. ada banyak bule di dunia ini .. jadi kalau mau buat sample jangan dari teman ke teman aja atau lihat disekitaran asia aja .. datang lansung negaranya dan survey lah !! Bayangkan berapa banyak mereka !! Tapi survey mu mungkin hanya beberapa persen tapi uda berani posting gini !! Gak cuman mereka aja yang punya kekurangan kita juga bahkan menurut saya lebih banyak !! Contohnya punya istri lebih dari satu bahkan biss beberapa !! Termasuk hawa nafsu sex juga kan ? Pikirkan balik bagimana mereka memikirkan itu ? Saran saya pergi keliling dunia dulu , survey lah per negara baru keluarkan pendapat mu dengan data valid !! 🥴|Gak usah pada emosi gitu dong. Kayaknya ini udah rahasia umum, emangnya baru pada tau? Atau jangan-jangan yg ngamuk itu diam-diam menikmati diobjektifikasi, dan malah membungkus self worthnya dengan fenomena yellow fever? Mudah2an nggak ya, karna kasihan sih sebenarnya..",1616

Please help us fight against domestic abuse. 🌙|I'm Nelson Paulo Ponte. in Selkirk Ontario. Canada. and I would just like to express how sorry I am first for being a man that ever unknowingly may have made any Woman ever feel like that!! Again my deepest apologies.. I won't say not all men ever again lol!!. So instead I'll say this ladies. Stop being afraid, I don't say this with out an idea on how, now this is just a suggestion. but I truly believe it's one that may help. So being a man that honestly never wants to make any Woman feel afraid in anyway, in fact quit the opposite giggle.. but joke's aside! I'm that guy that because of personal reasons n proper up-bringing.  I have the utmost respect for women all. So any word of my Female friends/family having an issue with a MALE they know that they can talk to me about it at least I hope they know this!! So apologies for my novel here lol but have to explain everything lest we misunderstand right! So suggesting that n I'm sure all U beautiful ladies do have a man/guy around that U do feel safe with right?? Here's the idea ok? tell that guy that in the nicest possible way ok!! that way they can't say any nastiness to/about U unless U don't care either way ofcourse lol. Now simply say that there's just something about U that I don't feel safe with. if they ask what just say not sure just a feeling but also I don't think my friend would appreciate Us talking alone okay!! Now that suggests that first n most important that Ur not comfortable alone with them n second that U may have a MALE friend bf/or otherwise!! not that it matters what that MALE friend may be, but that they won't like that Ur talking alone!! N it may defuse them by giving the unsaid maybe! that talking with other people there might be okay lol.. now that may sound a bit mean in a way, but U want to feel safe am I right?? just an idea.Well like I said at first it's just one suggestion okay hope it helps even just one of U fine creatures hehe.. yeah OK maybe I'm A bit of a naughty boy, n that's my own hope for all women to feel safe no matter the situation with that said I'll say good bye n god bless..",61

That way the Head Doc could just take a sneaky peek with all my insides spilt out and decide: guilty or innocent? Fallible? Valid? Diseased? Or just a little off?
.
I mean take a look at me? My current hair status is pea green. My shirt was just slightly see through largely cos I haven’t had an income to buy myself a thumping thick cable knit version with a collar done all the way to my neck and the matching suit of armour.
.
It’s a miracle I’m even here really. All for the thanks of a few good men. My Boss. My Doctor and My Man.
.
So while I’m driving I’m thinking do I act crazy? Should she maybe smell the whiff of liquor on me? Can I slick this hair over to look a little more ... how you say ... corporate? Why didn’t I think to bleach it? I’ve packed mascara cos I know I’m gonna lose it all over the course of the next hour. And I know nothing about this woman. Nothing!

Over the course of the next two hours she does the lobotomy. Piece by piece. Inch by inch. I’ve bent over and let her steel forceps peel back history, theology, medicine and diagnoses. Layers.

.
Still here! Still kicking shins. Still walking open hearted into conversations, friendships and alliances ... hopeful even!
.
Trusting because of the care of a few good men who restore my faith in man. Every. Damn. Day.
.
So I met this woman faithfully. Truthfully with no fudge or rubbery edges and in the end I was met faithfully too. History is always cold on reflection and I can’t talk about it here as it’s air tight. But I have a new diagnosis to add to my B.Com Et al. And that is all-bloody-right for me in so far as it is wrong.
.
The wrongs are not righted by the process. My issues aren’t resolved with hot water bottles. My income is not restored by the public sleeve readily. But my steel capped boots were made for walking and they click clack when they feel you close. A magnet for me and my army of good men and women. Spill your guts now!

Here is the line. There are all the bad men.” The Jimmys and the good men won’t talk about this line, but we really need to talk about this line. We need to talk about how men will draw a different line for every different occasion. They have a line for the locker room; a line for when their wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters are watching; another line for when they’re drunk and fratting; another line for nondisclosure; a line for friends; and a line for foes. You know why we need to talk about this line between good men and bad men? Because it’s only good men who get to draw that line. And guess what? All men believe they are good. We need to talk about this because guess what happens when only good men get to draw that line? This world — a world full of good men who do very bad things and still believe in their heart of hearts that they are good men because they have not crossed the line, because they move the line for their own good. Women should be in control of that line, no question.”

Just back and forth shouting. It's clear that most men and most women in fact most people are doing their best in a bad system. Why has it become so acceptible to talk about ""bad men"" but not ""bad women?"" It used to be women that carried all the sin and blame but now it looks like it's gone to far the other way and if we can transcend this back and forth nonsense and find a way to heal the hurt between men and women , on both sides, how will we ever break the cycle ?|I have never met a genuinely good guy that had to refer to himself as a ""good guy"". We know he is good by virtue of his ACTIONS.

All it says is that this generalisation of men being these emotionless bruts who only care about sex and fighting isn't true. I don't get why you'd have an issue with that. It's not all men, nor is it even most of them. Both men and women have bad people, and I'm sick of it being so one sided. I get there are bad guys, and I'm not perfect but don't act like you know guys better than we know ourselves|This post proves why women shouldn’t draw that line...|Problem with the Me too movement is that many women are abusing it and are lying which makes it worse for those who actually need help",2589

1399,203,"Cómo identificar si estas en una relación tóxica 
Hablamos aquí de machismo, enfocado para las mujeres que sufren de relaciones así y aprendan a detectarlo. Lamentablemente, también se dan casos de relaciones tóxicas en las que las implicadas son las mujeres o ambas partes de la pareja. Lo especifico para que no me lleguen demasiados #notallmen 
Otra triste realidad es que cuando estas relaciones tóxicas o machistas las desempeñan los hombres, más casos de los que creemos acaban en un desenlace muy feo, tanto que muchas de esas mujeres pierden la vida asesinadas por los hombres a los que amaron. No permitamos tal cosa. No cierres los ojos ante la violencia, no justifiques lo injustificable, no te cierres porque creas que nunca te pueda pasar a ti, no culpes a la víctima, no seas idiota y apoya el cambio, apoya la educación, el respeto y la no violencia siempre.

SO easily threatened. This US soccer team nonsense had bothered me for a long time. I mean, how many people can name even one member of our men's soccer team? I can't think of one... But almost anybody, soccer fan or not, could easily name at least three or more players on the current or former women's team. Because they're fucking celebrities! They do more to increase the popularity and attention of the sport than the men's team could ever be bothered to do. And yet they have to literally FIGHT to get equal pay. It's disgusting!|The work you do is awe-inspiring!! You have a brilliant and creative mind. Thank you for being a vocal advocate for feminism! ❤❤|Wth. Jerks and I’m sorry. I love this page!

But good for you for persisting.|Keep on kicking ass one stitch at a time!|🌟💗🌟|As a Jewish feminist author I have absolutely been there with the death threats - to me and my young son. I endured them for several years on twitter before I felt in such imminent physical danger that I went to great lengths to digitally erase myself. But I’m still working on my 2nd and 3rd books and when they are ready they will be published. I have no doubt that at that time there will be a fresh wave! But I enjoy being a hermit. I’m very sorry that you too have suffered this. Sadly, most women who speak out politically and about feminist issues will become the target of abuse, which only further demonstrates the feeble insecurity of the misogynist brigade. Always take your safety first, but never forget that you’re in the right in speaking about patriarchy and you have the right to say so. Plus you do awesome embroidery (fast!) I do embroidery sometimes, but I mostly crochet, but there’s nothing like sitting down with a hoop and needle in your hands. Keep up the great work!|😂👏🏼🤗|Good lord, the male ego is a fragile fucking thing. Keep on stitchin’, girl, we got you.|UNDAUNTING 💜|@heatherkmcmahan|Apparently the ‘boys’ are threatened by success.

1405,209,"""The male is a biological accident: the Y gene is an incomplete X gene, that is, it has an incomplete set of chromosomes. In other words, the male is an incomplete female, a walking abortion, aborted at the gene stage. To be male is to be deficient, emotionally limited; malesness is a deficiency disease and males are emotional cripples."" The Faculty of Dreams by Sara Stridsburg (2019)

I'm feeling provacative. The troll on my pro-choice post has got me all fired up, but in a good way. I'm not raging, I'm thinking. And, as @sofia_reading's reviews of Rage Becomes Her show, women are at their most dangerous when they're fired up and thinking. As Sofia argues, our anger is energy, and energy is power.

The quote above, comes from Valerie Solana's S. C. U. M (Society for Cutting Up Men) Manifesto, which, ironically, two men (Maurice and Paul) made ""big money"" from while Valerie herself wasted away in a mental asylum.

Men win from misandry too.

But we knew that already. We know that no one benefits more from pitting one group against the other than those at the top. We know that the argument that feminists are man-haters has been used to shut down otherwise very valid debate.

We also know that when you have spent an entire lifetime being sexually assaulted, or, like Valerie, systematically raped... Hating on the one common feature your aggressors all share can be kind of understandable.

But when men get upset about misandry, start proclaiming #notallmen and branding all feminists man-haters... Wait, isn't that what you're fighting against? Tarring everyone with the same brush?

What about #notallfeminists? What about nuance? What about #heforshe and #sheforhe. Gender inequality affects us ALL -- albeit different ways, even between non-males. Just because your sex and gender privileges you above others (cis males) doesn't mean gender inequality doesn't hurt you too.

Stop fighting and start uniting.

This is a bit silly, but I want to do it anyway, if you were going to come up with a new feminist hashtag, what would you use?

Tagged some badass feminists I have the pleasure of knowing.

I was going to say #WSABF for We Should All Be Feminists, but it looks like some farmers and the Washington State Apple Blossom Festival have already claimed it😜|Probably something like #humansforhumans or #theyforthey - I feel like the biggest issue the feminist movement faces is that, as you say, a lot of cis men think feminism is just about hating men / removing male rights. I get why they feel that way, you get the same reaction a lot of the time when you try to talk to white people about racism - when you feel like your privilege or way of life is at risk, even subconsciously, you go on the defensive or fight back. Humans have to start thinking more as a whole and less as individuals to evolve - equal rights for all requires the few most privileged to sacrifice that privilege and that’s a hard pill to swallow unless you understand the global and societal benefits.|#dismantleit look at the structural issues rather than attacking the groups and identities involved.|At first I came up with #yesallpeople  but I'm not sure I like it 🤔 because it's like turning #blacklivesmatter into #alllivesmatter and it ignores the specific experiences of oppressed groups and while yes all lives matter and yes, not only women experience harassment and discrimination, lives don't matter equally and in a patriarchy women are the most vulnerable group to experience discrimination (certainly so for biwoc, LGBTQI+, disabled, etc)|#BetterForEveryone because generally people are much more likely to take action when faced with a positive rather than a negative... and equality isn't equality if it only impacts one section of society.|Omg I’ve never been called a badass feminist 😱 but I love it😍 as for a hashtag I think #itsnotaboutmen would be a good one. Men have somehow managed to make feminism about them in the sense that feminists hate men and we’re out to get them. For once I’d like something to be about me, a woman. I’d like to have something not tainted by men or patriarchal society. Men just don’t understand. The world does not revolve around them, and yet they try to make it so.|Wow, I get to be in the badass group? 😊 Hm, lemme see... Maybe #createdequal|#GetOffMyUterus|“Men win from misandry too”. Wow, girl! You have got my brain ticking. That is some truth! I’m listening to @angeladsaini ‘s Inferior at the moment which goes into how science got women all wrong. The part I’m on currently is regarding the XX and XY chromosomes and the genetic implications that are being discovered and explored. She’s very balanced though and ensures socialisation, class and environment are considered throughout, but the science is astounding! I think you’d love it|I love your page! Keep posting and keep reading. ❤|Damn. That quote.|Tbh I kind of understand the gut reaction of 'Hey! That's not fair!' because most men are just not used to the feeling of the actions of one member of a group being seen as a representation of the whole group (which is what 'I hate men' usually is). They're not used to being blamed for shit they didn't do. Personally I have conflicted feelings about things like 'I hate men', 'I hate straight people', etc...especially if the 'targeted' group can see it. Ethically it's fine, a tweet does not equal systematic injustice. But practically I think it can lead to a lot of anger and that can have consequences for the women in the lives of the men who get angry. A tweet saying that they hate all men is not going to convince any dude to become a feminist or to take a look at all the shit women have to put up with, but it might convince him that women are irrational and look down on him which leads to frustration which lead to violence. I always get uncomfortable seeing tweets like that because I've had to defend myself in real life against 'I hate cis people' tweets that were made online by people I never met. But at that time those online people did actually endanger me irl. So yeah. Lots of conflicted feelings. Can't really say I support anyone saying 'I hate X group', even if it's objectively punching up. That shit's dangerous. The people it's aimed at still have more power and I don't want to anger them.|Sorry if this is super incoherent lmao. I just see a lot of people saying 'it's just a tweet it doesn't harm anyone'. It might not harm the group it's aimed at, but it does harm the people that that group gets angry at.|Also sorry for being super inactive. Lots of crazy shit has been going on irl 😅",191

🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🌈
Lately I have been stressing ALOT about this tariff/trade war going on with Mexico.
🇲🇽 As a small business owner, (Secret Harvest Hawaii has a whopping 2 people in it) trade agreements on a huge governmental level impact people like us the most.
🥺
However, Mexico grows a huge portion of our nation’s food, (like, HUGE. Even a lot of what says “California” is actually grown across the border, it’s just processed and distributed from California.) So that means this particular political issue could affect our national food supply.
🇺🇸 Anybody who has known me for awhile has heard me rant about America’s food supply and how I really believe it’ll be in big, big trouble in the next 5-10 years. This trade war feels like the beginning steps to shortages and major price hikes all over the country.
💰 
I know that’s uncomfortable af to think about- food shortages. Hell, I was so uncomfortable about it that it was a major factor in my move to this tiny island, and also my desire and decision to live on a farm that grows its own food.
🏝 
This is why is is SO important to support local farmers. They do so much hard work, and most of them don’t make enough $ to survive. Why? Well, because it’s generally cheaper to get things at the store. Even here in Hawaii, Californian carrots/sweet potato/broccoli, etc,  are cheaper than locally grown. It’s fucked up, but true.
🥕🍠🥦
Please just pay the extra dollar for your lettuce/apples/carrots what have you. Please support local farmers (especially if they’re making the effort to grow organically, or herbicide/pesticide free). Like, not just in theory, because EVERYONE supports local farmers in theory. Support them with actual $ to pay their actual bills by buying their food and paying fair trade prices for it.

1411,215,"Fantastic article by Clementine Ford. Too many beautiful, priceless human beings are excluded from the privileges of mainstream society on account of gender, orientation, creed, race, appearance, or disability.

Anything outside this narrow slice or normalcy is violently stifled or exploited by a pervasive cloud of toxic masculinity. If we are fortunate enough to have our experiences validated, we are told not all men.

RIGHT,  #notallmen exploit others for their own financial/social/emotional gain. #notallmen view other human beings as collection body parts for their pleasure or as deformities for their ridicule. However #enoughmendo.

#enoughmendo so much that the most vulnerable among us are also the ones most trampled upon.

The emotion you're feeling when your society is criticized for making whole groups of people feel like they don't have a place on this earth is guilt. It's been a long time since you've been made to feel it.

-
Jean Purdy played a key role developing IVF, yet she was snubbed for position on plaque honouring the researchers. 😟
-
🤱🤱 Along with Prof Sir Robert Edwards and surgeon Patrick Steptoe, Purdy conducted groundbreaking work that led to the birth of the first test-tube baby, Louise Brown.
-
Her male colleagues protested to health authorities for leaving her name out. So, you know.. #notallmen
-
Edwards wrote in 1981: “I feel strongly about the inclusion of the names of the people who helped with the conception of Louise Brown. I feel this especially about Jean Purdy, who travelled to Oldham with me for 10 years, and contributed as much as I did to the project. Indeed, I regard her as an equal contributor to Patrick Steptoe and myself.”

1423,227,"In light of this ""Straight Pride"" news taking over headlines and all attention during Pride Month, I can’t help the frustration growing inside me as to how so many can miss the point of these events. Much like the movements of today, like Black Lives Matter or Me Too which themselves are continued fights under new names, Pride started as a revolution of identity meant to bring light to those marginalized and brutalized for simply trying to exist authentically. Only now are queer people just comfortable enough to feel that we can have maybe just a day or month to celebrate ourselves publicly when for so long we had to hide behind false identities and conformity.

No revolution on the basis of identify is meant to obstruct or quash the rights, beliefs, or values of another group. No one is saying queer people are more important than cishets, black people matter more than white, or any gender should be taken more seriously or put on a higher pedestal than another. All that is being said is we want to be heard, to be seen, to be treated fairly and to not have our strife and struggle taken lightly. Straight Pride and All Lives Matter and #NotAllMen inherently treat these movements as if we already treat everyone equally when society does not.

These movements and celebrations are meant to give voice to those we don’t see enough of, hear enough from. When your identity is already set to be the default of society, you do not get to raise yourself higher than everyone else because you are inherently above all else. When you are not being persecuted and murdered for how you look or who you are, you do not get to say your life matters more because the fact that you aren’t afraid to be who you are shows us this. When your immediate reaction to any movement is to create a counter movement rather than supporting the initial cause, you just don’t get it. When you see things as us against them, you don’t understand what is trying to be said.

Let our voices be heard, and if you speak let it be to share these stories or to start the difficult conversations. Take the opportunity to help others who don't have the luxury of being you. #HappyPrideMonth",notallmen,|This is so well said 👏🏼🙌🏼♥️|👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼|👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻|I love this.|This. This. THIS.,176

Die letzten Wochen habe ich fast nur Essen und Nettigkeiten gepostet weil ich viel gearbeitet habe und mehr keine Energie hatte. ❗️
Ich bin ich einfach nur erschöpft. Erschöpft von sexistischer Kackscheiße. ‼️
Davon, dass ich und alle anderen Frauen und female identifying people sich immer noch (und wieder) so viel Mist anhören und gefallen lassen müssen. ‼️
Davon, dass man uns vergewaltigt und dann behauptet wir wären selber schuld oder und uns nicht glaubt. Dafür, dass ich und Millionen andere Betroffene dabei zusehen müssen wie Täter öffentlich lügen und Opfer der Lüge bezichtigt werden. Obwohl jeder betroffene Mensch weiß, dass es jedes einzelne Mal weh tut über solche Erlebnisse zu sprechen. ‼️‼️‼️
Davon dass man uns zum Objekt macht und nach unserem Äußeren beurteilt, nicht in Würde altern lässt und unseren Wert an unserer Oberweite, einer faltenfreien Stirn oder einem flachen Bauch misst. Uns von klein auf Optimierungswahn anerzieht. .
Davon, dass man uns nicht ernst nimmt in den Berufen, die wir ausüben. Selbst mit fast 39 passiert mir das noch regelmäßig. ‼️‼️‼️
Davon- wie #RebeccaSolnit in ihrem gleichnamigen Buch schreibt, „dass Männer mir die Welt erklären“
.‼️‼️‼️
Davon, dass manche Männer nicht abstrahieren können und sich mit dem patriarchalen System gleichsetzen und sofort zu jammern und diskutieren anfangen statt einfach mal 5 Atemzüge zuzuhören #notallmen #whataboutism
.‼️‼️‼️
Davon, dass der weibliche Körper immer noch überall auf der Welt von Männern und deren Systemen kontrolliert und reglementiert wird egal ob in der #weiblichenSexualität, wenn es um das #Kopftuch geht oder das Recht auf #Abtreibung

1430,234,"LA CARGA MENTAL
...
El otro día me preguntabais si la relación de pareja se había visto afectada por la llegada Blai.
Cómo dije, es un cambio grande y todxs nos hemos tenido que recolocar.
🌿
De todas maneras, me he fijado en que lo que se ha acentuado con la llegada de Blai son las cosillas que ya teníamos. Esas pequeñas cosas del día a día que antes iban pasando desapercibidas, con la maternidad para mí se han vuelto más grandes, imposibles de ignorar y suelen ser la fuente de discusiones.
🌿
Una de ellas es la carga mental. Aunque nosotrxs nos distribuimos las tareas del hogar y la crianza de Blai de maneras bastante igualitaria, la tarea de coordinación la suelo asumir yo.
🌿
A eso se le llama carga mental. A la labor (tan invisible a veces) de planificación, organización y toma de decisiones. A efectos prácticos esto se traduce en que soy yo la que tiene en la cabeza las citas médicas de Blai. Soy yo la que suele organizar las vacaciones. Y soy yo la que suele saber que hay que comprar pañales o qué juguete son los mejores para Blai.
🌿
Hace tiempo me encontré con una tira cómica que decía: “Mi marido va a la nevera a por un plátano, lo coge y vuelve a la habitación. Yo, en cambio, en el camino veo la cama sin hacer, una lavadora por tender y veo apuntado en el calendario que hay que anular la cita en el dentista. Tardo 30 minutos en coger un plátano”. Eso es la carga mental. Y lo grave de todo esto es que ellos no lo hacen de mala fe, o evaden responsabilidades conscientemente. Creo que es algo tan integrado en la cultura y en los roles de género que cuesta muchísimo deconstruirlo. Son privilegios que han asumido desde muy pequeños y cuesta mucha reconocerlos y renunciar a ellos.
🌿
Con esto lo que quiero decir es que a las mujeres aún nos falta mucho camino. Sigue habiendo muchísima diferencia en el peso que llevamos, aunque éste a veces sea invisible. Y creo que un primer paso es poner palabras. Explicar lo que pasa para empezar a cambiarlo.
🌿
¿Y a vosotras, os pasa? ¿Cómo lo trabajáis con vuestras parejas?.

Organizan vacaciones y no solo eso!  si no que ademas comparten en los grupos sitios para que otros padres sepan de lugares molones para ir toda la familia, esos padres que tienen noches de insomnio pensando que céntimo ahorrar para llegar a final de mes, que saben que faltan pañales y les duele no llegar a todo por no tener tiempo, hombres que enseñan a sus hijos e hijas que pueden elegir cualquier juguete de la tienda sin importar de que color sea la sección. No hablaré por todos los hombres, pero si por los que he nombrado antes y que sienten rechazo e injusticia cuando se habla así de los padres solamente por el mero hecho de serlo, la carga mental no es exclusiva y si por los defectos que pueda tener cada pareja se les atribuye por ser del sexo que sea, no habremos aprendido nada respecto a la igualdad.|Yo vengo a poner la nota discordante. No porque no conozca la carga mental (somos viejas amigas), pero sí para decir que todo se puede recolocar. Que las mujeres debemos aprender a soltar, también. No solo exigir que el otro tome el testigo, sino dárselo: confiar en ellos. Con todo lo que conlleva. No meternos en el grupo de whatsapp escolar. No comprar la ropa de nuestros hijos. No planificar menús ni anotar listas de la compra. No pedir nosotras las citas con el pediatra. No recoger las mierdas del suelo. Todo esto son pequeños gestos que vamos haciendo, uno tras otro, que inicialmente no pesan, pero acaban siendo una burrada. Quizás la pregunta es por qué empezamos a asumirlo las mujeres en primera instancia? Qué nos lleva a hacerlo? En mi caso, el cambio no ha sido un gesto reivindicativo, sino un proceso natural. He ido soltando y él ha ido tomando riendas. Sin discusiones, ni charlas explícitas. Hasta encontrar un equilibrio. Y es jodidamente fantástico. 😋|Me gusta tu reflexión, pero creo que es un problema de conexión de pareja desde sus cimiento, te leo y pienso: si, seguramente el ejemplo del plátano y la lavadora es cierto. 
Pero mi marido, sabe perfectamente cuando hay que llevar a Ona al pediatra y si no está en el trabajo, no se pierde la cita y a veces la concierto yo o él. 
Se preocupa de la evolución de Ona, por su aprendizaje, lee mucho y se informa de pequeñas cosas para intentar ser el mejor padre posible para Ona.
Lo importante es confiar en el otro, y que donde uno no llegue esté el otro para apoyarle.
Repartirse es las tareas de todo tipo es importante, para el alma y la mente de la pareja.|Leí la misma tira cómica hace algunos meses... y reflejaba la realidad. Es tan complicado que ellos asuman “porque si” esos roles... aquí intento que cada vez decida él más cosas, como que hacerle de cenar al mayor o que ropa ponerle... poco a poco! 💪🏻|Cuando decidí quedarme en casa a ser madre y ama de casa a tiempo completo no imagine que la carga mental del quehacer diario sería tan potente ... pero hoy después de años tomó cartas en el asunto intentado encontrar el equilibrio con la meditación y “organizando” nuevas  tareas en casa|A casa diria q estem al 65% - 35%|Ahora que estoy en casa con los niños obvio que la planificación del día a día cae más en mis hombros pero la verdad que no me provoca malestar puesto que sé que es transitorio y que por nuestras circunstancias lo hemos decidido así. De hecho mientras trabajamos fuera los dos conseguimos llegar a una sintonía muy guay. Y bueno aunque ahora yo esté en casa mi pareja sigue sabiendo si toca fruta o lácteo para almorzar, si hay que comprar una vacuna, si se está gastando la leche, si hay que limpiar el baño o qué día hay cumple trimestral. Estamos los dos muy en fase crianza intensiva y eso se nota. Y los años de hacer ajustes también!|""no se niña, decide tú"" o ""lo que tú quieras"". Es un rol inconsciente que tenemos asumido tanto unos como otras. Nosotras sobrellevamos esa carga, además casi nunca nos gusta delegar, y ellos nos recargan de carga mental... Pues ya la tenemos ahí, prácticamente toda para nosotras. Es importante aprender a delegar e introducirlos en esas tareas no meramente domésticas.|No se puede evitar tener mil cosas en la cabeza, qué hay que hacer, comprar, cocinar, limpiar (para las que no tenemos quien lo haga), lavar ... en resumen planificación constante! Y yo que siempre he sido de tenerlo todo atado ahora con la maternidad (sobre todo los primeros meses) era imposible así que respiraba hondo y me resignaba😅 por suerte o más bien después de mucho trabajo de años de pareja (18 ya) nos compaginamos bastante bien y no sólo estoy pendiente yo de la logística!|Me pasa.. me pasa todos los días.El no lo asume sin darse cuenta y yo lo asumo porque creo que tengo que hacerlo yo...y que lo voy a hacer mejor que él...ahí es donde tengo que cambiar el concepto 🙈|Cuanta razón... Es una verdad como un templo que no lo hacen a drede, los pobres a la que les mandas hacer algo lo hacen sin rechistar y al momento pero claro, te preguntas hacia dentro.... De verdad que no lo ves o ko te das cuenta, cuando lo hemos comentado miles de veces??? Yo creo que mas que el rol que han tenido desde pequeños depende más de cada persona internamente. Hay mujeres muy maniáticas con el orden y otras totalmente lo contrario, yo con chicos me encontrado de las dos maneras... O se requiere de mucha práctica y constancia o realmente te tiene que nacer ser así.... De todas formas es agotador tener que ir dirigiendo la orquestra a veces espero que a la larga como a los niños ya lo hagan de forma automática jejejejej mucha paciencia i grandes dosis de amor!|La verdad es que es un tema clave, cuando observo otras maternidades veo que lo más difícil es eso, la carga mental que conlleva tener la responsabilidad tu únicamente y no contar con la otra parte contratante al 100%. Yo puedo decir que no siento eso, mi pareja y yo nos encargamos ambos de la casa y ambos de la crianza, yo flaqueó en unas cosas, el en otras...antes eran motivo de discusión y ahora sin embargo desde que nació la niña las llevamos mucho mejor, repartimos y relativizamos mucho mejor. Y aunque yo he decidido quedarme en casa con mi hija (no con la limpieza de la casa) no siento mayor responsabilidad. Yo soy pedagoga y especializada en crianza, eso supone mucho pues soy yo la que más o menos saca los temas a reflexionar de como comportarnos: era algo complicado porque él se sentía criticado y yo me sentía la única responsable, supuso algunas discusiones pero a medida que ha pasado el tiempo eso quedó en el pasado. No puedo decir que tengo suerte pues creo que es responsabilidad de ambos pero si que somos afortunados. Mucha escucha, muchas conversaciones y mucho respeto 💚|Mi carga mental va más allá de ser madre, siempre...me acostumbro a vivir con ella 💕 esa carga forma parte de mi forma de ser y aunque me gustaría que fuera compartida no entiendo ni se la manera de evadir esa parte que es tan mia...siempre pendiente de todo, con la cabeza en esto y en lo otro...para además si no llego a algo o se me olvida termino castigándome a mi misma 😳|Es molt hevay veure que realment es un tema de genere que esta tant integrat i asaumit socialment. La carrega mental hi és i està invisibilitzada, fins a tal punt que a vegades fins i tot ena costa reconeixe-la a nosaltres mateixes. Gràcies per reflexionar - hi i per fer-nos-hi pensar. Per mi és un dels temazos de la maternitat.|Buf!!! Me gusta ver que esto tiene nombre!

Además confesado por Mario me dice que no lo hace a propósito.|Te felicito por saber ponerle palabras!! Y me encantaria a veces poder actuar como ellos... alguien lo ha probado???😅🤣|En mi caso soy  la q hace 'todas' las tareas de casa..y me cago en sos 😬|Parece que tengo “suerte” por tener tambien repartida la carga mental ademas de las tareas en general...pero creo que deberia ser lo normal. El sabe que talla de pañal usa,ve cuando faltan pañales y dice de comprarlos,sabe que alimentos toma porque el cocina casi siempre,etc etc|Em passa!!! Però no sabia que rebia aquest nom...🤣 Ara ric, però hi ha moments que m'estresso i més quan penso que al setembre tornaré a treballar!!! Llavors com es dirà? Carga mental al quadrat? 🤣 Jo li faig veure tot el que faig i li dic què ha de fer... Però després em relaxo i em torno a carregar!!! 🤣|Mira Paola, te amo. Ya sabes que este tema está entre nuestras conversaciones, pero lo has expresado tan bien y me siento tan representada en tus palabras, que sólo puedo darte las gracias 💜|A mi em passava i no ho suportava, em feia molta ràbia sempre ser jo qui organitzés ni que després la ""feina"" estés repartida a parts iguals. Crec que va començar a ser així quan va néixer el Narcís i jo estava de baixa de maternitat, al ser qui estava més a casa i amb el nen vaig acabar amb la càrrega mental. Un tira i l'altre s'hi acomoda. Quan vaig tornar a la feina seguia igual i vaig dir prou. Així que ho vam parlar i hem aconseguit repartir la càrrega mental també. Tots dos tenim present tot el dels nens, la casa, l'escola, cadescú la seva feina, la roba, la compra, etc. I n'estem molt orgullosos.|Totalmente entiendo lo que dices, esa carga mental que tenemos y que nos genera un estado de estrés continuo|Tal cual, aquí otra con carga mental ç, veo que es generalizado...|Puf! Me encanta que hables de esto porque siempre digo que parece que la carga mental no existe! Y es brutal! Yo hay veces que me siento agotada y es por eso... Cuánto queda por desgracia... Pero que bueno visibilizar... Conoces el libro de emma clit de la carga mental?|A mí también me pasa, y desde hace unas semanas intento que mi marido entienda en qué consiste esa carga mental, porque cada vez me cansa más. Pero es verdad que él no se da cuenta muchas veces. Queda mucho por hacer!|Totalment identificada😘|En mi experiencia tengo la sensación que ellos (lo digo en plural porque pienso en mi pareja, mi padre, mi hermano, mi tio...) no piensan “ya lo harán ellas” sinó que realmente no caen en la cuenta de según qué cosas porque no les importan/afectan. 
En cambio, para mi bienestar emocional, yo necesito vivir en un espacio más o menos ordenado, más o menos limpio; comprar, cocinar y comer comida buena, sana y equilibrada, etc etc. 
A veces pienso: “debe ser estupendo ser capaz de sentirte en harmonía estando en un espacio muy desordenado y sucio”. Creo que no solo influye lo que hemos respirado por ser mujeres, sinó que también tiene que ver el país. Cuando estube viviendo en Irlanda 2 meses, los (y sobretodo las) españolas coincidíamos en destacar que tenían todas las casas muy muy desordenadas y bastante sucias. (|Doncs jo ara estic llegint el llibre de ""el primer sexo"" i dóna explicacions fisiologiques, sobre el cervell concretament, per explicar perquè passa tot això que expliques, però crec que no parla de carrega mentaI.  M'està semblant molt interessant. La capacitat del cervell fisiologicament més aviat femení per veure la globalitat, fer diverses coses a l'hora , i preveure. I les capacitats més comunes en els cervells més aviat masculins (fer les coses duna en una per exemple, o estar mes en lo inmediat) I m'agrada pensar en la posibilitat de que efectivament tinguem els cervells en certa forma diferents i en que aquesta diferencia no tingui res de dolent. Sempre sens ha dit que homes i dones som diferents, agafant qualitats que podien ser certes per ridiculitzar i inventant altres (com que ens agrada mes el rosa). per mi és important pemsar en el mal ús que el patriarcat li ha donat a la diferencia, considerant unes característiques més valides (les masculines) que les altres (les femeniness) i creant així una jerarquia on els homes estan per sobre i suposadament les seves qualitats son millors i més necessaries. I clar el feminisme porta decades cridant que som iguals, i si en relacio a drets i deures hem de ser iguals, i en relacio a capacitat de desenvolupar tasques i assolir objectius tambe. Pero i si el cami que fa el nostre cervell es diferent i NO PASSA RES? Clar, costa ara despres d'haver estat tant discriminades per no ser suposadament tant bones com ells, plantejar-nos que potser si som en alguns aspectes majoritariament diferents. L'altre dia ho parlavem a la feina, i com es habitual va sortir la frase de: ""si perque jo vaig com una boja per casa fent 4 coses a la vegada"". Clar, a aquesta habilitat mes habitual en les dones, la societat li posa una carrega negativa. I si fos cert que majoritariament els cervells X (que tenen etiqueta ""femeni"" i solen anar lligats a les persones amb aparell reproductiu femeni) fan diverses coses a lhora i esta be aixi i no es ""anar com una boja"" ni es disteriques ni databalades? Que empoderador no? Acceptar com ets i donarli valor. ❤ a mi em serveix|Un altre es que una de les dues persones de la parella vagi saturada i laltre es repengi 😀|Seria algo com trobar equilibri entre: reconeixer respectar i posar el valor les habilitats de cadascu, i complementarnos, no pretendre que laltre tingui les meves habilitats. I repartir la fein al 50%. Moltes mares sagobien pk sencarreguen elles de tooot el que te a veure amb pediatra i infermera, que els primers anys es molt, val, i si d'aixo sencarrega la teva parella al 100% i tu toblides?. Clar que per oblidar-te has de confiar, aqui es on tu tambe has de trencar els teus prejudicis patriarcals... nosaltres hem tingut moltes discusions perqie jo faig 4 coses a lhora i ell duna en una (no pensenu que es perque jo li he retret a ell, si ni que al reves perque s'atabala amb el neu ritme), el llibre de la helen fisher ens ha servit per respirar aquest tema conflictiu duna altra manera. ❤️|👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Totalmente identificada!! 😊 Y trabajando en casa para cambiarlo 😉|Sí, totalment. Fa temps ho vaig llegir en un article i vaig pensar que era ben bé això.... la càrrega mental, estar sempre connectada al què es necessita, a tot, sense descans....|Increíble lo bien que lo has escrito🖤 realmente no se ve todo lo que hacemos a pesar de haber reparto en las tareas del hogar. El ejemplo del plátano es buenísimo; nuestro break al final significa seguir con las tareas (aparentemente invisibles pero están ahí) Con razón se suele decir ""mira que salgo por la puerta y aquí os quedáis"" Porque es así como al final podemos tomarnos un respiro. Y creo que lo deberíamos de hacer muchas más veces🤣 ¡¡Gran post!!🤗😘|Por aquí al principio yo asumía mucha carga mental, con la llegada de nuestro segundo hijo me “planté”. Decidí dejar de hacer. Al principio fue más caos, hasta que él asumió esa responsabilidad también de organizar, planificar, anticipar... y ahora esa carga mental es dividida. Ha costado que todo volviese a su sitio, pero creo que lo hemos conseguido. Yo he vuelto al trabajo fuera de casa y eso me ha hecho delegar más aún (él pasa más tiempo en casa por su trabajo) y asumir que él hará las cosas a su manera (también creo que fue un aprendizaje importante para mí). Hubo un momento crítico en el que sentí perder la salud mental de tanta carga y ahí decidí parar y cuidarme. Coincido en que es algo muy cultural. Además, cuando te pides excedencia para cuidar a tus hijes parece que también lleva implícito esta carga mental y las tareas del hogar. Creo que estamos cambiando cosas y, ojalá, las nuevas generaciones no tengan que vivir ciertas cosas|Me pasa y lo peor de todo, es que hasta hace poco que leí sobre ello, no sabía explicar cuando sentía esa carga y me agobiaba, no sabía ponerle palabras al porqué de ese agobio 😣|Muy identificada 🔥|@francisco_serrano_26 lee atentamente...|Tal cual... Nosotros nos ayudamos de aplicaciones en el móvil para la lista de la compra o anotar los gastos, también me encargo del desayuno y la comida, pero de la merienda y L cena se encarga mi marido (con todo lo que conlleva). Esto último me ayudó mucho a aligerar la carga mental diaria. pero la de la agenda y ropa sigo siendo yo. También diré a su favor que: la limpieza es de los dos, lo hace él cuando yo no llego y él lo ve|Creo que también es una cuestión que yo llamo tolerancia a lo que está por hacer. Es decir, para mí hay muchas cosas de la casa que no pueden o no deben esperar, en cambio para marido es lo que dices de ir a por el plátano, no lo ve, no le da importancia, ya se hará...|A-M-E-N 💜|Estoy totalmente de acuerdo, me pasa lo mismo! 😅, la foto me encanta! ❤️|@lupus_markus|Yo tengo que decir por fin, que tras 2 negocios y 3 hij@s, estamos iguales en carga mental. Y mola taaaaanto. O sea, hay esperanza🙌|Uf, es el gran temazo! Yo para ir siendo cada vez más equitativos, le suelto TODO lo que tengo en la cabeza y ahí empatiza, en general mi pareja no es consciente del volúmen heavy si no se lo voy diciendo, cada vez lo tengo q decir menos y está mucho más cerca de mí. A mi me sirve buscar un dia a la semana en el que cada uno habla durante unos cinco minutos sin interrupciones de lo q necesita y el otro sólo escucha sin generar diálogo. Después habla el otro. Va muy bien para soltar sintiéndote totalmente escuchada...|@taimmgp @amparo.mr87 a nosotras también nos pasa. Esa carga invisible y tan difícil de llevar con el agotamiento. Un abrazo eterno 🙅‍♀️|Qué bien lo has descrito y qué razón tienes. Yo a veces discuto en casa porque se supone que “yo no trabajo y tengo todo el tiempo del mundo” y el resto del mundo tiene derecho a quejarse cuando no queda café o papel higiénico. 
Y mi marido, que colabora mucho en casa si digo la verdad, pero que sigue sin entender cómo funciona de verdad una casa : 
Pues ya voy yo a hacer la compra, hazme la lista!!!! La lista???? Hazla tu, que eso también forma parte del trabajo. 
Yo siempre le digo que para que el frigorífico esté lleno no solo hay que ir a comprar. Hay que planificar las comidas y cenas de la semana, los eventos extras que haya (excursiones, cenas con amigos) y entonces pensar en la lista de la compra, ir al super, volver a casa y ordenar. Para que luego abran y digan : Y yogures de coco no has comprado?
.

🤦🏻‍♀️ En serio....?|Me encanta leerte. Siempre erres mi pensamiento 😂😂 ellos estoy segura que no se dan cuenta, y a la hora de decirle que estás agobiada o que estás al límite, te dice pero si yo acabo de poner una lavadora, acabo de fregar, de sacar al perro. Y es verdad, pero como explicarle que no es sólo eso...que no vale solo hacer la cena, queue hay q saber que va a comer el pequeño al día siguiente, que va a cenar, si le quedan pañales, si hay que comprarle otra capa de baño proque le ha quedado pequeña, si a las sábanas le han salido pelotillas... Preparar la bolsa del carro antes de salir ...ajajaj. nos queda mucho por hacer!! Pero lo conseguiremos!!!! Un beso gigante|@xavidal89|Ufffff.... Gran tema. Amb aquesta segona maternitat ho estic veient molt més accentuat. I de tant veure-ho, estic deixant anar una mica (molt poquet), lo just per no petar. Però és una feina taaaan invisible q fa mal fer-la. Almenys a mi. És com portar una empresa. I per tant, hauria d’estar remunerat.|Jo! No lo habría descrito mejor! En mi caso el cocina, siempre! Pero mucho tiempo lo pasa fuera de casa, así que en ese caso tb me toca, y yo llego de hacer conciertos muchas veces a las 3 de la mañana, y en lo que voy a tomar un vaso de leche, he visto y recogido los cojines del sofá, las migas de la mesa, los juguetes tirados, la cita del médico que hay que cambiar porque nos ha surgido otra cosa, la ropa que hay que retirar porque ya no le vale, y el resto de la rutina, pañales, leche de la peque que se está acabando, cereales, su gel, en fin... supongo que lo de siempre, la carga mental, que a veces nos puede, al menos a mi!! A eso añado cuando tengo que dejar a los enanos, porque yo me voy de concierto y el está currando fuera, con quien, a qué hora, cómo 🙊🙊🙊🙊🙈🙈🙈🙈|Madre mía, gracias... nunca habría sabido definirlo como carga mental. 🙈❤️|No es tema solo de diferencia cultural de roles, es que neurologicamente funcionamos diferente, y hay que saberlo y tenerlo muy presente para no sofocarnos. Su mente funciona diferente, tienen una visión más concreta, si van a buscar un plátano se concentran en el platano, igual que si les pides que busquen alguna cosa les cuesta más encontrarla porque no tienen mentalmente un campo visual tan amplio como el nuestro. Así que paciencia!!! Nuestras prioridades y exigencias son diferentes.. Con ello no quiero decir que tengan que columpiarse, ni mucho menos, pero calm down chicas!! 👌|Y que me decis del momento vacaciones? Quien hace la maleta de los niños y se ocupa que no falte nada? 😭😭😭|Siiiii sin duda yo tengo carga de esa!! 😂 pues lo hacemos como podemos la verdad, pero sí que es verdad que yo asumo mucha más responsabilidad en el día a día de Ibón que mi chico...|Nosotres por suerte la tenemos bastante bien repartida. Somos socios de un negocio, compañeros de vida y criamos a un hijo juntos y hemos sabido repartir la carga mental de estas 3 cosas de forma bastante equitativa. Siempre que hablo d e este tema intento cambiar la perspectiva de la gente...porque intentamos que ellos sean menos pasotas, porque no nos volvemos nosotras más como ellos?😅😜|Que identificada me siento con tus palabras! Esa carga mental!|Imagínate a mi que no me ayuda en nada y cuando lo hace es porque me pongo ya enfadada....me dice que solo trabajo media jornada jajaja asique enfado por aquí y por allá  e incluso a veces me pienso que la amargada y rara soy yo por pasarmelo discutiendo en fin....estoy intentando cambiar de chip porque al.final la q esta mal siempre soy yo......😊😊😘|Creo que ese es el principal lastre del machismo. Los hombres no son conscientes de esa carga porque no es tan obvia como lo demás. Es tan importante visibilizar lo. ❤|Buenisimo!!!! Lo de ir a por el plátano y ya o ir a por el platano y pararte a hacer  mil cosas es tal cual. A pesar que en mi caso la corresponsabilidad es muy grande,  aun así  hay cosas....... medicos x ejemplo o lo del plátano  que es tal como describes|Amé tu post. Incluso se lo leí a mi compañero y estuvo de acuerdo. 💜|@laialuu|Me gustaría decir todas las cosas que hago a nivel organizativo, y no para defender lo indefendible, pero quizá para dejar constancia que en algún porcentaje también  existimos padres con carga mental. Si yo existo, alguno más habrá, digo yo. Hay cosas a las que aún no he llegado, porque tampoco es plan de llegar a todo si somos dos. Como novedad, para el año que viene ya me he propuesto entrar en los grupos de WhatsApp de las madres del cole y de la guardería para no depender de recibir la información de mi pareja en estos temas, que no son pocos... En fin, me abruma leer que existe tanto desequilibrio en muchos ámbitos del hogar, y aunque no se de mala fe, o una cuestión cultural, sigue siendo un peso que cargar.|@estherco91 ♥️|Uf lo de la carga mental es tremendo... Una sentencia que de momento, llevamos en el ADN. A veces me pregunto cómo será sin toda esta responsabilidad sobre los hombros. Poco a poco, en mi casa vamos poniendo ladrillos hacia una mejor salud mental familiar, pero cuesta mucho luchar contra algo tan arraigado.|Tal cual, que sin hijos también se da... 🤦|Me siento súper identificada con todo lo que dices. En algunos casos, somos las mujeres quienes llevamos la carga mental. Y cansa, mucho.|Oi tant q em passa! La dichosa carga mental! D'acord amb tot el que has dit! Moltes hem arribat a aquest punt incoscientment fins q se li ha posat nom i llavors ha arribat la consciencia, la pregunta ara es com ho invertim? Pq moltes pensarem q si no ho fem nosaltres dubtem q ho facin ells...|Me pasa exactamente lo mismo. La carga mental es agobiante y cansa un montón. A veces intento soltar las riendas y que las coja Mireia, pero al tiempo que me harta tener la carga, me cuesta delegarla. 😢|Pues trabajamos muy mal, toda esa carga mental de la que hablas y que existe no la reconoce y por su horario laboral ya da por sentado que todo el tema del cole, médicos, pagos... Es mío, no sabe ni cómo se llaman los profesores de mi hija... Bueno el de la tutora si... Y es difícil como tú dices, en su casa su madre se encarga de todo y así ha sido siempre, esta normalizado... Y si hablamos pero luego es lo mismo|Acabas con la cabeza como un bombo al final del día de intentar llegar a todo... Siempre es uno quien tira más de las riendas en ese sentido...|¡Totalmente cierto! Nosotros nos dividimos muchas tareas, pero la que sabe donde está, que hay que hacer, como hay que hacerlo, cuando hay que hacerlo, soy yo... y con todo y eso digo que no hago nada, es que esto está incrustado en nuestro ADN, en nuestro inconsciente colectivo y cómo cuesta ir cambiándolo|Nos pasa! Trabajamos en casa y hace poco hablábamos de que a mí me costaba concentrarme en la empresa porque mentalmente coordinada un montón de tareas paralelas. Me lo dijo él, yo no siquiera me había dado cuenta. La casa ha sido mi lugar de trabajo durante casi cuatro años y me cuesta relajarme. Desde que me lo dijo, he ido soltando y él agregando a sí mismo y poco a poco creo que se equilibrará! Yo lo siento como cuando abres muchísimas ventanas en jn oo|Yo lo siento como cuando abres muchísimas ventanas en un ordenador. Así es mi mente cuando se trata de estar en casa|Es TAN así! Con hijos y sin hijos, pero con peques se acentúa como bien dices .. ser consciente ayuda pero aún falta mucho|Cuando nuestro hijo (ahora 2a) empezó a comer, yo era la que pensaba el menu aunque casi siempre lo preparaba mi marido (las tareas de casa son comprar y cocinar él, ropa y vajilla yo). Llego un punto en que le pedí que el tema de la comida del niño se encargara él y q si no lo planeaba que el niño no comería. Y asi fue. Se li tomó en serio y funcionó (y funciona) bastante bien 😊💪|En casa cada una lleva la carga mental de algo distinto, Eli es más de la limpieza y comida, yo la parte económica, lo que hay que arreglar, contratar y gestionar seguros y servicios varios, y el perro. Aún así creo que a veces sería mejor que viera más las cosas de casa, ya que eso está cada día y lo otro te puedes gestionar mejor para controlarlo y organizarte. Eso sí, lo de Arlette va repartido, la pena ahora son las noches y la falta de sueño de Eli por el tema teta, pero lo demás es de las dos, odio perderme un pediatra pq trabajo, alguna vez me ha pasado y no me mola nada, siempre intentamos pedir lo antes posible para que sea por la tarde. La guarderías hemos ido las dos, etc. Si que vemos en algunas amigas que la carga de los bebés es de ellas, y es normal que haya cosas que solo pueda hacer o se le haga más fácil a la mamá gestante pero lo demás es de los dos. No puede ser que un papá o una mama no gestante no sepa que ropa usa su hijo o que crema es la del culete 🤦‍♀️|Bufff totalment. I en dies en que la carga mental et sobrepasa i fas la tipica pregunta „que sopem?“ per a que ell agafi una mica les regnes i poder „desconnectar“ almenys de pensar el menu de sopar.... en comptes de decidir i prendre iniciativa et contesta amb un “que tenim?”, ya es muerte y discusión. 😣|También me pregunto si en algunos casos no nos cuesta ceder al control. Por ejemplo, yo sé que si suelto las riendas de las tareas de casa, nuestra casa no estará como a mí me gustaría. Llevamos una semana aprox. Con cambios y lo noto pero comprendo que mi estado es más relajado ahora que antes, cuando quería que todo saliera de manera Equis. Crees que tiene que ver?|*ceder el control|Exacto!|La carga mental es lo que menos disfruto de esta etapa. Intento hacer menos, visibilizar lo que hago, pero a la vez algunas cosas disfruto hacerlas, pero me agobia no tener el tiempo que quisiera para hacerlo bien y parece que diera órdenes todo el día o peor ""que no supiera relajarme"".. bff, tema peliagudo.|#TrueStory yo intento “soltar” algo (tarea y la carga mental asociada) de vez en cuando porque si no me agoto y me pongo de mal humor, y no quiero discutir por cosas domésticas... no sé, hay días que se lleva mejor, y días peor. Pero sí, la cosa está un pelín descompensada 😅|Que ejemplo tan bueno. Yo en acción! 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️|Guau jaja me ha flipado como lo has resumido. Es más, le voy a decir que lo lea jaja|Yo no tengo hijos ( llega en agosto ) y esto ya me pasa Muchísimo. Eso sí, la mayor parte de las tareas de la casa, comida limpieza etc...se las lleva él. Carga física, carga mental. A veces es una cuestión práctica de "" a quién se le da mejor"" o es más eficiente en cada cosa y en nuestro caso funciona bien así|Jo justamente el otro dia tuvimos discusión por éste mismo tema, al leerte me siento tan identificada... Pensaba que era algo sólo nuestro, de su educación, sus padres tienen totalmente el rol de padre dominante y madre que lo hace todo por todos... Pero veo que es tan simple como que ha sido siempre así en todas las familias en mayor o menor medida o con otras connotaciónes... Sinceramente me sentí muy agobiada por ver que no entendía exactamente lo que le decía ya que él intenta ayudarme y no veía mi postura en ése momento... Después de esa conversación estamos mucho mejor y él intenta abarcar el máximo, pero como tu dices es algo a lo que no están acostumbrados de la misma forma que nosotras y que debe cambiar, y me pregunto: solo el hecho de ser ejemplo en casa hará que nuestros hijos no tengan ésta carga?? Me gustaría educarlos de forma igualitaria pero al mismo tiempo es tan complicado con la figura de los abuelos sobretodo. Igualmente, creo que el mero hecho de ser conscientes de ello, hablarlo con nuestras parejas y llegar a un acuerdo que nos haga sentir bien a los dos ya es un paso, y poco a poco conseguiremos ir mejorando más ésta ""carga""|En nuestro caso si soy yo la que sabe cuando hay que llevar al pediatra al bebé, o que talla de ropa usa pero en casa la verdad es que es él. Él planifica compras y comidas, él sabe cuando hay que limpiar el baño, o se encarga de llamar al técnico porque el WiFi no funciona... No sé, el niño yo la casa él ¿Empate? No, el trabajo también él así que gana 🤭|Todo lo que dices me representa totalmente. Lo único que me consuela es pensar que yo también tengo tareas absolutamente “delegadas” de las que no me ocupo en absoluto; compra y cocina, por ejemplo. Y eso me quita algo de carga mental. Pero sí pesa sentir que tú llevas la coordinación de todo.|Cuanta razón en todo, no sabría ni por donde empezar para explicar la situación en mi caso, al no estar yo trabajando me encargo de TODO yo mientras él trabaja, luego cierto es que cuando llega todo se reparte pero como comentas, que haya pañales, comprar la talla que toca, estar pendiente de ir añadiendo alimentos nuevos, que no falte leche, lo necesario para matricularlo en la guardería... etc, organizar el día a día para que falte nada ni para nosotros ni para el pequeñajo, mentalmente, es agotador... gracias por este escrito pd: y no, no lo hacen con mala intención|Guapa, un gran tema ;)|Total. Palabra por palabra. Igual. 💣Carga mental, responsabilidad, tener que decidir siempre... 🙌Muy bien expresado🙏|La carga mental la llevo yo tb... pero la de la lista de la compra y el menú no... más el tema de mar. Te vas a reír pero un día le hice un examen tipo: qué número de pañal lleva Mar? Qué pescado no puede comer? A qué edad le pusimos la vacuna X? Preguntas de este tipo para que se diera cuenta de todas las cosas que pasaban desapercibidas y que controlaba yo|🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️ dichosa carga mental, no podrías haberlo explicado mejor|Es un rol que asumimos por naturaleza, de manera quizás inconsciente, nos dejamos llevar por la mamá leona que nos sale al parir y de que nadie mejor que nosotras puedo hacerlo igual de bien (en este caso, carga autoimpuesta....), pero estoy de acuerdo en que también hay las cargas mentales impuestas por estados jerárquicos del hombre, que en mayor o menor medida, ellos llevan inmerso... Así que lo ideal sería cambiar un poco de las dos cosas, ni que ellos se acomodaran tanto, y que nosotras aprendieramos a delegar, almenos, ciertas situaciones que nos pueden quitar un poco de carga... La crianza de mi hija ha sido intensa y demandante, y ahora con 5 años, a veces desfallezco... pero por suerte, formar un buen equipo y entender las necesidades del otro, a veces, a parte de necesario es tranquilizante, aunque en según que cosas, también tenemos diferencias en la forma de hacer y pensar... De como afecta a otro nivel de pareja, lo dejo para otro día 😂😂😂|Totally agree!!|De esa carga mental yo voy hasta arriba 🙌🙏🧘‍♀️.... y se q no lo hace de mala fe pero uuufff hay días....🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️❤️❤️",580

Una noche me dijo ""no puedo dormir"" y le contesté ""hazte una paja"", acompañando el mensaje con una foto mía, con ropa, donde se veía mi cara y mi escote. Esa fue mi primera y última foto subida de tono, porque al tiempo empezó a comportarse de forma irrespetuosa y cuando decidí no verlo más, me amenazó con ""voy a enviarle tu foto con cara de guarra a todo el mundo"". Yo misma la subí a mi Facebook porque la verdad, hay fotos mucho más calientes ahí, fue liberador. Me alegré mucho de no haberle enviado desnudos y lo hablé con todas mis amigas, que jamás enviaron desnudos desde entonces. Ni siquiera lo hago con mi actual novio por si le hackean el móvil.

Todo esto no es más que un idealismo irracional. Si comprendieras la naturaleza humana y los límites de su comportamiento entenderías que una libertad así es imposible, tanto en el ámbito sexual como en cualquier otro. En esta vida no todo son prejuicios y patriarcado a vencer. Hay aspectos naturales de la propia mente que NO pueden cambiarse. Si todo el mundo hiciera lo que le diera la gana sólo por la mera creencia de que merece ser libre nos habríamos extinguido como especie hace miles de años. La libertad de una persona, como todo en esta vida, tiene sus puntos positivos y negativos. Por ende, en exceso, es malo. Y en esta vida, si dejamos a un lado los idealismos, podemos percibir que todo tiene consecuencias. No es el mundo el que se tiene que adaptar a ti (básicamente porque es imposible), sino tú quien debe adaptarse al mundo. Y no me malinterpretes, aquí cada uno puede hacer lo que quiera, pero luego, cuando toca pagar el precio, a llorar a la pared, no a los demás ¿sabes o no?|👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼|Pues mis fotos circularon por todo un pueblo y no fueron ningún hombre las que lo pasó... hay que dejar de decir que son los hombres y meter las mujeres en el mismo saco.|Me parece una tontería. Yo entiendo que todos merecemos respeto y tal, pero la gente NO respeta, y ni podemos ir mandando fotos de nosotros porque pueden terminar en cualquier parte. No podemos tener tanta libertad, por lo menos por un tiempo.

El cuerpo de una mujer es libre y puede tener completa libertad sexual de lo que sea que quiera. No debe ser juzgada ni humillada y quienes se atrevan hacerlo solo demuestran ignorancia. Tus post son información que curan|Un hombre que expone la intimidad de una mujer no es un hombre, es un mierda|Estoy de acuerdo salvo con las primeras 2 imágenes. Uno puede hacer lo que le venga en gana, como grabarse y mandárselo a quien quiera, pero si se educase a que un ser humano no es un juguete sexual con el cual otra persona deba masturbarse se acabaría el problema de base. Lo haga un hombre o una mujer, por qué grabarse para que otro te use de objeto? Estamos de acuerdo que el que lo recibe no debe reenviarlo. Pero a mí parecer como ya dije y reitero, tampoco está bien convertirse en el juguete sexual del otro mediante internet|Es una injusticia, pero en el momento en que compartes un vídeo dejas de tener control sobre él. Si el otro es subnormal no es culpa de la chavala pero no quita que en esta vida no debes fijarte ni de tu sombra.|@holarita_|Yo me acuerdo de una compañera que paso por lo mismo pero fue muy madura salio adelante y lo peor es que ella también tenia fotos de él en su celular fotos de su miembro y aun así por todo el infierno que pasó ella gracias a él. ELLA JAMÁS LO EXPUSO EN LAS REDES SOCIALES. Todas nos preguntábamos  porque no se vengaba tenia como 5 fotos intimas de él en donde se encontraba completamente desnudo que esperaba para subirla darle su merecido con la misma moneda y ella dijo que no le desearía este infierno a nadie no desearía que otra persona pase por lo que esta pasando ella y que ademas no se piensa rebajar a su nivel sí ella hace lo mismo que hizo él no habría  diferencia entre ellos dos así que decidió no hacerlo por esa razón por ella era diferente a él, ella no era un monstruo sin corazón  entre lagrimas le dijimos que la admirabamos mucho no solo como  mujer  sino como ser humano.|Estoy súper de acuerdo con esto, solo que especificar con ""él"" u ""hombres resentidos"" es demasiado cerrado, sé que la mayoría de los culpables de este tipo de cosas son hombres, pero también hay mujeres.|@dani_nogaa|Completamente de acuerdo, muy bueno! 👏👏👏|Enseñaría cada viñeta tuya en colegios e institutos, a ver si el personal aprende. Adoro como explicas todo 😍|Una Libertad que acota la Libertad de otra persona no debería ser denominada Libertad. Cada uno es libre de hacer lo que quiera. Si pasa tus fotos, es un cabron, pero no puedes impedírselo. Eso sí, esa persona se retrata a sí misma como una persona que ha actuado con mala voluntad. Esto se consigue con educación y es genial que esta publicación divulgue la idea correcta.|El problema ni siquiera es que ese vídeo se haya pasado, sino que la gente se ha dedicado a humillar y despreciar a una persona por disfrutar del sexo, algo que además todos hacemos. Ella puede hacer lo que le dé la gana, como si quiere enviárselo  ella misma a toda la empresa. Eso no da derecho a nadie a humillarla. El argumento de ""es que para que se graba, para que loanda"" es el de ""por qué llevaste minifalda"". En ñuga|Yo para evitar esos problemas pido que no muestren la cara, por si algún ""amigo"" o ""amiguita"" le pique el culo con rayar a la mujer...

livro: A mãe de todas as perguntas: reflexões sobre os novos feminismos (edição da @companhiadasletras, de 2017) 
autora: #rebeccasolnit (trad. Denise Bottmann)
pela primeira vez: 2018
📖
sinopse: o livro reúne ensaios da década de 2010 da autora do best-seller Os homens explicam tudo pra mim – ou, em outras palavras, considerada a responsável pela origem do termo “mansplanning”. Solnit fala de diferentes temas do feminismo de uma única vez – maternidade, misoginia, silenciamento feminino, violência contra a mulher, estupro, entre outros – recorrendo a exemplos recentes e autoexplicativos.
📖 
modo de ler: Rebecca fala para todas e todos com convicção, mas sem arrogância. de maneira clara, mas com uma escrita impecável. afirma sobre o quanto o machismo é desonesto e cruel com as mulheres, mas também com os homens, trazendo-os ao centro do debate. questiona e subverte. um verdadeiro chacoalhão.
📖 
citando: “Em 2014, quando as mulheres queriam falar sobre violência sexual, muitas vezes eram confrontadas por homens que queriam se concentrar no fato de que nem todos os homens são estupradores. Esse subconjunto de homens até criou uma hashtag, #notallmen, como se a questão central fossem eles, com sua reputação e suas comodidades, e não esse flagelo sobre a Terra. É um problema de lógica e linguagem: os estupradores estão longe, muito longe de abranger todos os homens; imaginávamos que todos entendiam isso, mas praticamente todos os estupradores são homens, e assim tem sua utilidade poder dizer que homens estupram (e homens e garotos também são estuprados, mas muito menos do que mulheres e meninas)” (p. 154).

1453,257,"Durante los últimos días, los insultos que he recibido de hombres se basan en:
- el consumo del vídeo porno es un derecho: ""¿ahora no vamos a poder ver un video o que?"" (Sin mencionar para nada las consecuencias de dicho consumo) - también lo compartieron mujeres (obviando que el morbo y la sexualización de Verónica difícilmente será idéntica en el consumo femenino). - Ella no debería haberlo grabado ya que es una irresponsabilidad y demuestra poca inteligencia (sin valorar la libertad que deberíamos tener de poder hacer lo que queramos con nuestro cuerpo sin tener miedo a que se filtren a modo de venganza).
.
¿Qué responsabilidad tiene una sociedad frente a un suicidio cuando este suicidio es forzado?
.
¿Qué papel juega el morbo y el machismo en el hecho de que Verónica se viese obligada a suicidarse cuando un video íntimo suyo se viraliza entre compañeros de su trabajo?
.
El caso de Verónica pone sobre la mesa el debate de un deseo masculino construido sobre la impunidad del consumo, sobre la idea de que tenemos ""derecho a todo"" y que desde luego, si hay que pagar consecuencias, no seremos nosotros. .
La educación patriarcal nos ha construido desde la certeza de que nuestras acciones nos salen gratis y de que no tenemos la culpa de que las mujeres sean débiles, por lo que podemos hacer lo que nos venga en gana.
Y no. Si fuésemos empáticos sabríamos que el precio que pagamos es en las carnes de las mujeres: miedo, frustración, dolor. Si fuésemos empáticos este precio nos parecería inasumible. Pero parece que no lo somos. No lo suficiente.

It's basically about being offended by others being offended. 
The Hashtag NotAllMen originally stems from an article by Time Magazine, where it criticises generalisations about men by saying that “not all men are like that”. Obviously by stating that it’s “not all men” doesn’t really help anybody (especially with uncomfortable topics like sexual assault etc.) as it's  just a phrase that tries to shift the blame. That’s why it soon became a popular internet meme, but is still oftentimes used in a serious manner when people feel offended by generalisations about the male sex.

Gak ditujukan untuk satu orang ? Jadi #notallmen itu bisa digunakan tergantung situasi menurut gue .. kalo dia bahas masalah secara pribadi yah jelas gak bisa .. tapi kalo dia bahas laki laki secara umum yah toh menurutku disini subjek laki laki secara umum punya hak untuk bilang gak semua laki laki sama .. dan dia mustinya bilang secara spesifik siapa yang brengsek, jangan bilang laki laki doang|g ngerti gw:"")|banyakin konten begini, pliss.. 😆🙏|This!! I do believe that Not all men are like that and not all women have been assaulted. But all men and all women knows someone who are assaulting and have been assaulted. And that is enough.|@josechristoven baca leleh|Disitu bilang harus mendengarkan pengalaman hidup orang dalam kasus ini pengalaman cewek yg pernah mengalami kekerasan dari cowok,tpi memurutku menolak #notallmen juga brti cewek2 atau siapapun itu gamau mendengarkan balik pengalaman pria yg baik2 dong??not all men mengespresikan bentuk normal psikologis makhluk hidup manapun ketika dia di sudutkan,klo emg nyatanya saya ga melakukan x knp saya harus terima statement bahwa cowok itu smua kurang ajar??beda konteks ketika sicewek bilang bukan cowok melainkan langsung di A tuh cowok suka pelecehan,nah yg diserang bukan cowoknya tpi individunya,jgn sampe kita bocor psikologis klo kata cak nun,benci prilaku dan pelaku cmn jgn benci tempat dari mana dia berasal(keluarga,teman,sahabat,gender sekalipun)krn mereka mungkin mereka gatau apa2|Point should be noted: give people space to express their reality even if it's the exact opposite of your life experience.|Menjelaskan notallmen itu mungkin unnecessary, karena ya semua orang sudah tau bahwa selalu ada pengecualian. Tidak semuanya jahat, dan tidak pula semuanya baik. Menyampaikan perasaan dan pengalaman perempuan mengenai pelecehan itu jauh lebih necessary karena itu jarang dibicarakan, jarang ada solusi yang lebih masuk akal, bahkan kadang makin menjerumuskan dgn dalih ""wajar, namanya juga cowok"". Lagi, tentu ada perempuan yang menggeneralisasi tapi itu pengecualian saja. Membesar-besarkan notallmen di Indonesia justru merebut kesempatan perempuan untuk setara. Ia merebut ruang yang selama ini masalahnya dipandang sebelah mata dan dilanggengkan.|Actually, in my opinion, when someone talks about women in general with the intention to degrade the whole gender i would be pissed. But when the statement is about personal experience i wouldn't. For example: i'm okay with a man saying ""women are gold diggers"" when he's just experienced that, cuz i know that doesn't involve me and i know he's saying that only because he's currently sad. But when he says the same sentence with other purpose i would be pissed. In the end it depends on the situation.|here's something that i want to say about this. i do think people use the hashtag notallmen to argue that they are not amongst the ones that some certain women think so badly about. because well, they genuinely are NICE people. it does not make your whole past problems (with men) as ""invalid"", if thats where youre going. in my perspective you still have your own right to voice your thoughts. and lets all agree to a FACT : you cant generalize people by their gender. not all men act like A and not all women act like B. so the whole hashtag for me isnt the problem, but its the way that some people percieve it.",3401

1493,297,"#notallmen have treated others badly but all men have received privilege at some stage over women and #allmen will feel it's effects in time if not now.

#feminists have been fighting for equality for an eternity and sometimes it is about trying to unlearn bad habits and take up space both physically, psychologically and emotionally. That way we can lead the way into a world that feels right for everyone. *

I was thinking about this tonight after being intimate with someone and suddenly welling up with tears.

That said, I don't think it's right to brand women as domestic abusers. I think the problem with referring to abusers as ""men"" is that people feel like it's attacking men and not abuse as an idea. For change, I only think that the rhetoric must change to go agaisn't abuse and not against the idea of men who abuse.|(a) an increase in men having lower faith in judicial systems, believing that people will assume that men are always the abusers and not the abused|And (b) an increase in the number of men not reporting abuse by their partners for fear being humiliated as non-masculine.
