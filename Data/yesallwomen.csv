The film @girlrising has been brought to MWF by @nomadsgivingback! to showcase the power within young women! Girl Rising documents the stories of nine girls from around the globe taking on daunting cultural and societal barriers to gain education and independence. Their stories are a true testament to the power and resilience of the human spirit. Although the stories are deeply personal and intimate, they reflect the hardships and experiences of girls everywhere. ⁣

14,14,"I love being a woman, with all of its complexity, beauty, vulnerability and strength. I love my intuition, my femininity, my passion, emotional prowess, intellect, sensuality, fluidity, physique--I'm thankful.

To me, being a woman is multifaceted and profound. It is unconditional. Being a woman doesn't boil down to my genitalia and the ways that men--or any masculine of center person--can objectify me.

I hate it when men try to make me feel like a woman because they conflate my vulnerability with weakness. They don't recognize or respect my fullness. To them, making me feel like a woman means reminding me of my place as less than their equal. For example, I've met many men who make a big deal about holding the door for me, even if I got there first/am trying to hold the door for them, because their ego cannot handle reciprocated kindness from a being they perceive to be weak. Or when men insist that I go first in a group of men--that gesture isn't about respect. If it was, then they would insure that I (and every woman) feel safe in a group of men everywhere, instead of always watching my back. 
I hate it when men craft womanhood based on the ways that they can violate and take advantage of us. I hate it when they see us in need of protection BECAUSE of them (which is why the ""good guy"" narrative is so trash...you just benefit from this fucked up system), while making themselves the only solution to our safety and autonomy. 
I hate the way men conceive of womanhood, with their simultaneous coveting and disdain. 
I love being a woman, in all that it can mean. But I hate it when men try to make me feel like their definition of a woman.",yesallwomen,|#yesallmen #yesallwomen #menaintshit #heaintshh #heaintshit #misandry #misandrist #fuckhim #empowerment #empoweredwomen #ilovebeingblack #ilovebeingawoman,2
15,15,"And sometimes we do. Here’s how to tell when you should speak up. 🗣⁣
⁣
Speak up if... ⁣
🗣 Someone has made you feel unsafe ⁣
🗣 You need to share your truth for your internal peace ⁣
🗣 You need to rework expectations/norms with a loved one⁣
⁣
You can set a boundary internally when...⁣
🤫 You can prevent the uncomfortable situation by adjusting your actions ⁣
🤫 The person is a stranger/someone you have no real relationship with ⁣
🤫 The person is toxic and it’s not worth your energy/not productive to talk to them ⁣
⁣
What do these look like in the real world? 🌎 ⁣
⁣
You can set a verbal boundary when...⁣
🗣 A guy on the internet sends you a dick pic⁣
🗣 Telling said guy that’s unacceptable would make you feel better, even if nothing changes ⁣
🗣 Your mom shows up at your house without your permission ⁣
⁣
You can set an internal boundary when...⁣
🤫 You realize being at your mom’s house negatively impacts your mental health ⁣
🤫 You’re catcalled on the street⁣
🤫 Your Aunt has a history of disrespecting people’s boundaries and is someone you don’t want to spend time with anyway ⁣
⁣
Here are some sample boundaries: ⁣
⁣
🗣⁣
🙅🏻‍♀️🍆 “I don’t tolerate unsolicited dick pics. You’re getting blocked now.” ⁣
🙅🏻‍♀️🍆 “This is inappropriate and unacceptable behavior that makes people feel unsafe. If you are looking for a relationship, do better.” ⁣
🙅🏻‍♀️🚪 “I don’t accept unannounced visitors and I won’t answer the door. You need to call and check in with me before showing up.”⁣
⁣
🤫⁣
🙅🏻‍♀️🏡 You decide internally to not spend > 1 hour at a time at your mom’s hoarder home ⁣
🙅🏻‍♀️🐱 You decide it is not worth your time/unpaid labor/safety to try to explain how catcalling is wrong; you choose to ignore the comment out of protection for your mental health, not as a way of condoning it⁣
🙅🏻‍♀️👵🏻 You choose to spend less (or no) time with your Aunt in the future since she is not ready to learn/grow/change and you know it’s not your job to show her the light ⁣
⁣
What verbal 🗣 and internal 🤫 boundaries do you need to set? Let’s discuss! 👇🏻⁣

No excuses. Abortion is not women's health care. Want one pay for it with your money not mine. Don't care one way or another just leave my money out of it. Grow up and stop crying about make believe stuff.|Lmao why dont yall just stay out of other peoples lives if they dont affect yours? If it's not your body, mind your own damn business|This is not aesthetic|There is more to it than that.  There is the religious overtones - the crazy ones anyways - but there is also the other side of that.  What if the father wants to have the baby?  He has no say.  What if he doesn't want the baby?  Too bad, pay support for 18 years.  There has to be a way to make the situation reasonable for everyone.

I believe in a woman's right to choose, but I also believe in a man's right to choose too.|How bout this, we give women ultimate choice but the guy gets to choose whether or not he stays involved. His body his choice right?|Awe but what happens when men don’t “feel” like wearing the condom. “It doesn’t feel as good” or “I can’t feel you”. Men need to stop wining unless they will step up and take care of that child as equally as the mother is expected to.|Can we stop using a derogatory term like breeders?

And why should my tax dollars pay to “take care of it?”|it NoOne saying just cuz u dont have the choice to terminate a child makes u a Second Class citezen. It makes sense if ur having an abortion if known metl issues will occur or rape, but if you know that u cannot support a kid then dont hav ex unprotected, dont put yourself in that situaion just cuz a man told u ""I dont want to wear a condom, u have the power over that.|Louder for the old men in the back who don’t have their hearing aids turned up.|👏👏👏👏👏👏|What about checking your grammar before you write such definitive statements?|A man's worth is his net income.|👍🏻 I agree along with it's her fucking body no man has a right to tell a woman what to do with her body|The same way a man doesn't have a right to kill his child, a woman doesn't have the right. A woman is more than a baby maker, until she makes a baby. You don't want a baby, don't have sex. Use protection but even that can fail. It's not that hard.|Don’t have sex = don’t get pregnant. A man apparently doesn’t have a say in the decision unless the woman forces him to pay for the child with the backing of the State. Fathers apparently mean nothing anymore|💯💯💯|What astounds me is being able to voluntarily get a vasectomy but not a hysterectomy. Apparently people with wombs are more likely to 'regret' it 😡|No actually. You choose not to have unprotected sex. You choose to take the risk of getting pregnant which is not hidden knowledge to you. You don’t have to have children. What we are saying is you cannot kill a human being who is scientifically alive.|""Not allowing a woman to terminate a pregnancy means that her entire worth is derived from being able to carry a pregnancy to term"" wat|👏🏾👏🏾 #prochoice|Gay|❗️Having less kids is actually gonna save the planet. By having one less child in each family it will save 58.6 tonnes of CO2 emissions per person per year. Compared to the amount of tonnes people contribute by not recycling which is 0.21 tonnes having one less child is an extremely massive number in comparison. Why would we ban abortions? If you don’t want a child you shouldn’t have to have one because by being forced to have this child you’re only contributing greater and to one of the greatest contributors of global warming. We won’t have a world to bring these unwanted kids up in if people won’t stop wining about forcing women to be baby machines and actually help to save the planet❗️|I love kids but it doesn't mean that I want kids|Don't make men second class by not being able to choose whether or not they get to raise their children.|So by that logic forcing men to pay child support essentially means we value the money they make over their mind, body and value as a human being or whatever it was|👏👏👏👏👏👏|👏 👏 👏|That makes no sense.|I don't know man every major modern calamity during our life time women had the right to vote... coincidence 🤷‍♂️|No ones trying to take your right to choose to have a child away. If you want to have a child that’s your choice! Killing a life isn’t girl power. Choosing to kill because it inconveniences you isn’t body positivity. Choosing to have a baby when it wasn’t planned is true strength and respect for other women.. why I had my daughter and raising up a strong girl even though it wasn’t planned. How can we support killing innocent lives? I just can’t do it. I disagree completely with this post.|Sorry even more, God Gave is child bearing. We are gifting a human into this world, not sure why that would ever make us second class. We are not the same as animals. Only thing that can make you second class is the mind frame in which you choose to allow. We are heirs to the kingdom of God, the most high. Guess it’s all about how you choose to look at life.|God gave us *|Why is this even a topic? For the most part I stay out of it however..... how is it that you feminazis cry about the right to kill your bad decision to avoid the responsibility and accountability of your actions. You do know how babies are made right? If you let a dude cum in you 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ then you decided you were able to have a child. If you aren’t able to handle the responsibility of it, then there are PLENTY OF FORMS OF BIRTH-CONTROL. Some for FREE!!!!! If you can’t handle the decisions regarding your sexual partners, or even whether or not you should be ejaculated in, how is it that your qualified to make the decisions regarding actual life itself? Also, no ones calling anyone second class citizens except for the professional victims ( modern feminists) that are technically calling themselves that. And you all get your granny panties in a bundle, rape and incest should be  treated differently and I agree that’s terrible.|This is a bit over exaggerated",6498

This man felt it was his god given right to “extend a hand in friendship” and just wouldn’t take Leave me alone for an answer. This “hand of friendship” quickly escalated to other comments about how I should cut him a break and shouldn’t be so hard on him. Why doesn’t he cut ME a break and do what I want?

22,22,"“I think this is burnout. I can’t really remember a head space that wasn’t totally fuzzy. 🙅🏻‍♀️ I’ve got so much stuff going on: trying to juggle a full time job, starting my degree, running a blog and the supporting social media pages, launching my new website and merch store, finalising and publishing my book and juggling a lifestyle deemed appropriate and helpful for my PCOS. I’ve got social events coming out of my ears and absolutely no fucking money, free time or motivation. My house is either spotless or frighteningly messy (Kim and Aggie would have a mother-loving field day) and this appears to mirror itself in my appearance; I’m either dressed up to the nines, going out to drink copious amounts of gin and pretend I’ve got my life together or I can barely get out of bed, let alone brush my hair, and go about my daily activities in a zombie-style trance 🧟‍♀️. And for once, I really don’t want to whinge. I want to be positive Polly and pop up on your Instagram feeds reminding you to drink water, love yourself and have a great day. Except, right now, I want to fucking throttle Polly, whoever she is. And if I don’t address this, I won’t be able to deal with it and will likely feel fuzzed for the foreseeable future. 🌫 It feels pretty GD rubbish to admit you think your life is falling apart a little bit, and you don’t know how to stop the seemingly downwards spiral, but there 👏🏼 is 👏🏼 no 👏🏼 shame in it, and often reaching out is the first step to feeling much, much better. Plus, I like to be as honest as poss with you mega-babes to remind you that ‘real’ life is more than brunches with your besties, bikini selfies and book clubs. It’s gotta include the bad days, weeks and months, otherwise no-one will have any relatability and we’ll all keep hiding away our thoughts and feelings, inevitably causing more damage than intended. 
Ironically, I couldn’t post this on #WorldMentalHealthDay. Partially because I was so wrapped up in some other trivial issue that social media content was the last of my bloody worries, and partially because I couldn’t fucking identify it and therefore didn’t have the words.” 💭 (Continued on blog) #WomanOnTop",yesallwomen,"|#Female #FeminismTag #Inspo #Feminism #Feminist #Blog #Blogger #UkBlogger #SexBlogger #Follow #WomensRights #Empowerment #SexPositive #YesAllWomen #GirlBoss #GirlPower #HeForShe #IntersectionalFeminist #Confidence #Equality #BodyPositive #FeministKilljoy #WomenSupportingWomen #FeministBadAss #FeministAF #NastyWoman #InstaBlogger #Natural|❤️❤️❤️❤️|We are all just human in the end.

But that means everything else falls off, I start to feel guilty but still do not have it in me to show up. For me it comes in waves consistently.

⁠⠀
Yes, it’s totally unrealistic in Florida to look forward to the typical cooler weather that comes with the change of season, but there’s something about the approaching holidays and festivities that has me excited. Truth be told, I used to wince when a person ordered a PSL before October or Christmas music started playing before December. But as the years pick up pace and I get older, I find myself longing for more time with these simple traditions and the people I love celebrating them with. So why not start a little early?⁠⠀
⁠⠀
You still won’t find me ordering a PSL anytime soon (and don’t try to convince me that orange fluid is tasty) but I’m already halfway through my fall candles and binging all the spooky shows. Who knows, maybe I’ll embrace this new attitude and put up a Christmas tree before Thanksgiving. —Morgan #babeswhohustle",yesallwomen,"|.⁣⠀

According to @susangkomen research, it’s not because of sexual orientation, but there is an increased risk because many are choosing to never have children, or are having children later in life, they have higher than normal obesity rates and or increased alcohol use. Everyone’s situation is different, but this shouldn’t be taken lightly. #GetFed with knowledge.

My parents literally ask ME for money & trying to survive in this settler society is beyond exhausting (especially when everything was made to erase your existence) . Most if not all of my problems are linked to colonization. I have depression, anxiety, PTSD & suffer from seizures, not only that but I have been battling an eating disorder all year & I’m not going to lie, it definitely gets hard and I do some days just want to give up & delete everything and be a normal ass college student (bc yes I do think it’s unfair that as someone who grew up without running water & electricity has to educate tons of privilege ppl on the daily) but I know deep down I was meant to do & be more & I really do care so mf much to where I can’t not do anything! I have also decided to reconnect with my father after cutting him off for a year due to his addiction & that alone is just super draining but I know it will pay off.""

54,54,"“Attitudes towards menstrual blood in contemporary Western culture still circle around the subject with a mixture of denial and horror, advertisements for sanitary products typically use blue liquid in an attempt to sanitize the reality of blood, weary old jokes circulate about not trusting anything that bleeds for seven days and does not die. Menstrual blood is constructed either as something that requires a hygienic makeover or as something unnatural and obscene, a further indication of the horrors of sexual difference and the threatening ‘secrets’ of the female body.” -Ruth McPhee⁣

⁣
✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹✹⁣
⁣
Remember everyone, be compassionate to YOURSELF first. ⁣
⁣
Honour how you REALLY feel. ⁣
⁣
Honour your heart and your sacredness as a sentient being, and speak from that place.⁣
⁣
Stand in your truth, be the eye of the storm, and don’t allow others to pull you out of your centre.⁣
⁣
If they really love you, they will respect your boundaries. They will listen, they will hear you, even if it takes time and lengthy conversation. Stay with it, stay in your Truth.⁣
⁣
If you have been hurt by someone, if the trauma keeps on nudging and nudging at the peripherals of your consciousness, that means something wrong, and you also have to honour that. You need to (when you’re ready) speak out about the abuse and hold the abuser responsible.⁣
⁣
If someone is trying to control the way you think, talk, feel even, the way you express yourself, that is about them and them being uncomfortable with your emotions and your truth, that’s not on you, that’s on them. And, again, if they love you they will hold space for you to express yourself in whatever way you need to, instead of trying to control the situation and silence you.⁣
⁣
Be compassionate with yourself first. Honour yourself first. Honour your truth and stand in it, stay in your centre. Be a warrior for yourself. Let your voice be heard. ⁣
⁣
Despite what we’ve been taught, offering your Truth really is the greatest, and most compassionate, gift you can offer the people in your life.⁣
⁣
Blessings and may the Goddess give you strength and courage.⁣
⁣
I love you,⁣

Real devastation|the only time a man should give his seat up is if they’re pregnant disabled or elderly|It is completely devastating. Really really painful... 😓😓😓💔💔💔|Tbh it was freeing. It’s like you deal with so many things thinking it’s okay and normal and then you just kinda get out of that dark place and feel free|Yeah this kinda shit really fucking sucks|Ugh. Good riddance, C U Next Tuesday.|Agreed|I struggle to remember exes, but 4 years later I still am ready to run my ex bestfriend over with a semi several times.|I’ve lost so many friends. Friends who turned to bullies, betrayals, backstabbing, etc etc. It hurts every time|It also hurts a lot when you feel like you’re drifting from your fav person|I had to “break up” with my four year long best friend and even though I was doing it for the right reasons (I found it was becoming toxic and that we weren’t getting along like we used to) she took it very very hard, and that in turn impacted upon me as well cause I didn’t expect it to be so hurtful, even though we’ve now moved on|YES AND A HUNDRED TIMES YES|This is soooo true and so sad; this is heartbreaking|Fucking worst break up ever. 😨😨😨😨|I had a really good friend. Like. Really good. I share so many memories with them. They turned out to be a backstabbing snake and would pin point everything wrong about me, they'd make remarks about my personality and bring up old shit that we got over. We never had fights. But then they decided to bring up stuff I thought we'd forgot and that's where it fell apart. I tried to make it work but they would always ruin it. Eventually, I stopped trying to be better and we haven't talked for months. But mentally, I'm so much happier without their toxicity. I've met some manipulative people who were so dangerous now I think about it. But I'm so happy to be rid of them and have the best friend I could ever wish for right now. So for anyone getting over a bad relationship, it'll get better. You'll find people who will make you happier than they ever did. And you'll look back and realise how much they affected you.❤️|Without a doubt the worst heartbreak for me. 20 years later I still hurt. I still miss her. I never in my life tht there would be a time this lady would not be by my side. My ride or die. Never. Romantic relationships are amazing but girlfriends are irreplaceable. When they choose not to love you there is a hole in your heart. I'm not sure mine will ever fully be filled.|Soo hard. Thanks for sharing !|YES!!🙏🏻🙏🏻|@burger.mouth exactly what we talked about ayer|I had that happen. We were friends. She walked twice. I et her back in once. Second time. Hell nope. She has tried to come back in twice. I kept it moving.|""especially a woman friend"" ????|i completely agree with op but the ""especially a woman friend"" threw me off. why should it be different for women than for men? they're both equal, neither is better than the other|""especially a woman"" sounds like someone is sexiest.. seeing that it's #feminist this is not surprising.|What’s worst is when it happens and you have no reason why..my GREATEST friend stopped abruptly being my friend and to date I don’t know why..I know her life went in a complete different direction than when we were friends but I always believed our friendship could withstand and survive anything. She missed out on so many great moments in my life like my wedding and divorce 😂😂 but I always missed her|„The Edge of seventeen” is a movie that addresses the loss of a best friend|„The Edge of seventeen” is a movie that addresses the loss of a best friend|Hurts a lot 🙃|Me and my closest friend were separated (not really a falling out just unfortunate circumstances) and I took their absence really hard. Never felt so lonely. All I did was listen to breakup songs but it was a shame I could never find anything about missing someone platonic instead of romantic. Felt like I couldn't really talk about it with people which is crazy cause a best friendship can be your longest relationship with another person and that heartbreak is real.|It's been three years and I still haven't gotten over it.|@rosie._ann|I agree. Losing my best friend was worse than losing any relationship before and I grieved long and hard|Was it Dolly Parton?|I do still love her ok? I just can't allow her in my life.|bruh i miss you guys so much, i love you **** and ***|when i lost my bestfriend everyone lost me, i lost color. i was already in a terrible spot and losing her and her not wanting to be friends anymore killed me. she was the closest friend i’ve ever had and i was really hurt. We’re on speaking terms now but we will never be as close as we were then, and that’s what truly hurts|Yes, I lost a best friend almost 2 years ago. It was over business. Big misunderstanding, but unrepeatable. I think of her everyday still. ❤️|I know this... Completely agree... Have been through the same....Still coping. ...It took a long time to reconcile with the fact that she was not what I had thought her to be...?|I have been reeling from this for the better part of a year. Finally went to see someone because the pain would not go away. ❤️❤️ Thank you for sharing|I lost two in the same year. Both life long friends. Wtf?|Happened to me three times in the past two years... still sad about each of em 😔😔|I got into a big fight with my former best friend in spring 2018. It was my fault, but since we live far apart and I didnt fully understand what I had done (I was not aware of what was bothering her for years), I only got up the courage to write to her and apologize this summer. She didnt want to make up, and I have not been the same since. We were best friends since starting school in 2006|@mr.king.ak or two of them?!?|she prolly deserved it. i do that to people that aren't worth my time all the time|I decided to cut lose a best friend I had throughout my school years and even though I was the one who made the decision it haunted me for years and to this date was the hardest breakup I've ever had. It was ultimately a good decision but it's hard when friend groups take sides and stories get mixed up 😓 so much more intrusive then a romantic relationship it seems (in my case anyways)|Gone through this. A 25 year friendship. I’m still getting over it four years later. She was the love of my life.|Recently ghosted by a creative partner/friend of 30+ years because (I think?) I suggested she strive to achieve her goals instead of those of others... anyway, she asked me for advice, didn't like my advice, then later in the day my husband posted a pic of a star wars record album on IG (we're just unpacking from a recent move) and my friend, who I guess was angry from earlier in the day and evidently thinks only she is allowed to post about star wars, composed a really hateful text message about my husband and me that spoke of us in third person, and then she (I believe mistakenly) sent the text to me. I didn't respond, I was waiting for an apology. Within a few days she blocked me/unfriended me on most social media and had her ""crew"" do so as well. I feel sad but at the same time, have to believe the universe is just doing me a favor. Peace ya'll.|Why especially a women?|❤️|I cry harder when Carrie and Miranda get back together in sex and the city movie than I do any romance.|when my best friend of 7 years dumped me right after new years because i was toxic as fuck without realizing it. it’s been a few years and we’re on good terms now but it’s not the same, which is okay, but it hurt sooo fucking bad|Yes!!! This👌my sister in law blocked me 😢|Thanks for sharing my story. Feminist practice is also about telling the truth: even when it’s painful or doesn’t make you seem perfect|I just got friend-dumped semi recently. It happened in a way that I was like “Fuck it. I don’t need her.” But it still hurts.|@cierra.marie.kerns 😔|Two years ago I had to cut a friend out of my life after over 30 years of friendship. She wasn’t necessarily toxic but she prioritized every single other thing in her life over nurturing our friendship to the point that despite living within a 30 min drive of each other, she just never made the time to get together. She also never called, texted or checked in. I felt gas lighted after a while when I’d asked if I’d ever done anything to piss her off. She kept saying no yet never put in any effort to remain friends. I eventually felt shitty enough about it that I realized it was causing more pain than it was worth. So I cut her out of my life starting with unfriending her on FB. It was just too painful to see her posts about all she was doing, knowing she had no time for me in even the smallest of ways. Sad thing is, I doubt she’s even noticed. I still think about her often and wonder what the hell went wrong. It’s a different kind of haunted than a romantic break up. The sense of betrayal is deep.|I just got friend-dumped semi recently. It happened in a way that I was like “Fuck it. I don’t need her.” But it still hurts.|So is the story that she's gay?|It was an awful heartbreak|💯💯💯|i honestly feel like shit|Agreed, best friend betrayal is life-changing 💔|:(|The loss of a friendship hurts way more than a relationship|I’ve been slowly distancing myself from a friend. I’m there when she needs me but don’t feel the reciprocity. I listen but am not heard. It still sucks and it makes me sad.|Losing that female bond was the most traumatic experience of my adult life.|I’m still not healed and it’s been over a year.|My best friend passed away 4 years ago. I still hate myself for not going to her funeral. I stayed home because I couldn't get out of bed, i just cried and slept. I still haven't went to her grave because that shit hurts. I know she would understand why I didn't go. But honestly it still eats me up. 😭|I lived with my best friend for 2 years, and during that time is was great, I helped her through some pretty emotional shit and she was there when I broke up with my bf. But then I decided it was time to move out and get my own place. I gave her heaps of notice and let her know it didn't have anything to do with her. But she didn't take it well. Fast forward to first week in my new apartment and she cut all contact with me. Stopped replying to my messages, calls, just dropped off. So I unfriended her on FB, cuz it hurt to see her still interacting and being present with other friends whilst completely ignoring me. Looking back, it wasn't an equal relationship and makes me doubt if she ever considered me a friend. Still hurts, so I moved on with my life|THIS|Losing my best friend of a decade because she resented me for leaving our home down and consequently did my family real dirty when we took her in... hell, it gutted me worse than and romantic breakup. Shared my entire childhood with that walking garbage fire, trying to see the best in her. 😡|I had a great friend when I wasin college. I met her there and we conected right away. We completed each other sentences and did everything together. Se both helped each other with emocional trauma and other stuff and we always had our discussions but, after some time, everything would turn out okay. Suddently, on the last year of our course, she started talking less and less with me, made a new friend got a new boyfriend and never talked to me again. Until today I never new what happened. Still think about her lots of times. It's sad that she never had the courage to tell me what happened.. 💔😢",6864

62,62,"Time to celebrate! After what has felt like forever ( 4 years!) The article I've been writing for @brightresearch has finally been submitted and submitted for pre-print. 🎉
.
.
.

I'm so proud of this achievement personally because it's been something I've been working on, on and off through bouts of illness, in between various jobs and navigating through time differences. 🍾
.
.
.

I can't tell you much about it till it's actually published but it's part of a research project into #femalegenitalschistosomiasis (FGS) We've also learned that this paper will be able to be citing for future funding opportunities for Bright. 🥂
.
.
.

Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic infection after malaria. It's treatment is quick, cheap and easy but it's still horribly neglected and FGS especially has been largely ignored and unknow. One can't help but wonder if this is because it affects women, and specifically women in poverty. 👩
.
.

It is also important that we highlight and address the needs and challenges girls face, while promoting girls’ empowerment and the fulfillment of their human rights. *
Even though we've made great progress, there is still much work to be done. An average of 15 million girls marry before the age of 18 years; every 10 minutes, a teenage girl dies as a result of violence; 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; 1 in 3 women will be a victim of sexual assault in their lifetime. We must use our voices, our energy, our money, our hands, our votes to fight for gender equity, because when women win, everybody wins and we have a healthier, wealthier, more equitable, peaceful and productive world.",yesallwomen,"|.

89,89,"Happy International Day of the Girl to all of my female/female identifying sisters! Today we celebrate all the women of the world and remember just how powerful each of us is. It is also important that we highlight and address the needs and challenges girls face, while promoting girls’ empowerment and the fulfillment of their human rights. *
Even though we've made great progress, there is still much work to be done. An average of 15 million girls marry before the age of 18 years; every 10 minutes, a teenage girl dies as a result of violence; 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; 1 in 3 women will be a victim of sexual assault in their lifetime. We must use our voices, our energy, our money, our hands, our hearts, our votes to fight for gender equity, because when women win, everybody wins and we have a healthier, wealthier, more equitable, peaceful and productive world. #dayofthegirl #equalitycantwait",yesallwomen,"|.

90,90,"Globally, 1 in 5 girls will be married before the age of 18. 1 in 3 will experience gender-based violence in their lifetime. It is estimated that 60% of chronically hungry people are women and girls. Just 39% of rural girls attend secondary school and data from 42 countries shows that rural girls are twice as likely as urban girls to be out of school (stats via @unwomen).

119,119,"I’ve always been a night owl. It feels like a different part of my brain wakes up after 8PM and oftentimes no matter how hard I try (or how many cups of chamomile tea I drink) I stay up later than I should. While this can be a benefit at times, it certainly isn’t conducive to waking up rested and ready for a productive workday.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Recently, I accepted a job offer (!!!) which not only starts at 8AM, but is also in downtown Jacksonville (ie: 30 minutes away from my house, sans-traffic). I’m thankful for this new opportunity and excited to learn all the things, but I’m also aware of what this means: no more weekday late nights for this insomniac. It means earlier bedtimes, waking up before the sun rises and leaving my house at 7AM. It means revamping my habits and prioritizing the ever important and extremely vital necessity many of us neglect: sleep.⁠⠀

👉🏻Contact us now|Go to Winston for an early morning yoga class.

Whole Foods, Amazon, etc.|No screens 30 minutes before bed, sound machine, and diffusing all the lavender essential oil ✨|ahh you got this 😍 still learning how to be a morning person for work but having a yummy breakfast planned definitely helps motivate me to get up 🍳|For me, it’s all about the routine. I will say, I put my phone down at least 30 mins before I sleep, and I have to have my sound machine. 😂 @mo_purvis - we would get along well. ❤️❤️|Set an alarm on your phone to start getting ready for bed. That way you don’t lose track of time!|I listen to an audio book! I know the story by heart so it’s just background noise and the narrator does voices for the different characters (it’s Harry potter) you can set a timer andI’m  usually asleep before he stops reading!|Loving this outdoor to indoor design!|I have about the same situation! I prepare my coffee, pull out my curling iron, and lay out an outfit, and other morning stuff the night before so everything is happening with the touch of a button or quick change! 🌸 Good luck, gal!|I have the exact same problem, and I’ve recently bought a daylight lamp. I sit in front of it every morning for half an hour while doing other things, and it’s really helping me reset my biological clock, making me more tired during the evening and waking up more refreshed in the morning.|Once dinner is over we go plug our phones in the other room and don’t touch it until our morning alarm.

We spend too much time telling girls that they cannot be angry or aggressive or tough, which is bad enough, but then we turn around and either praise or excuse men for the same reasons. All over the world, there are so many magazine articles and books telling women what to do, how to be and not to be, in order to attract or please men. There are far fewer guides for men about pleasing women.”⁣

Mental health is a tricky thing to write about, and has it’s own dedicated chapter in my upcoming book. It was hard to write, but I did it. Not one part of me was comfortable spilling the details of my depression and anxiety onto those pages, but I felt like I had to do it. Even if it helps only one person, it will have been worth it. It’s so hard putting yourself in a vulnerable position and asking for help, but there is no shame in it. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health and should be prioritised as so.

Kardashians - love em or hate em, it doesn’t matter.  Because when a group of entrepreneurial women are compared to one another based on nothing but their weight, you’ve gota speak up!

In response to such a post, @jameelajamilofficial started the #Iweigh campaign - ladies, it doesn’t matter what your weight on the scales is because you are not defined by your size!! You are defined by your achievements, your love and compassion, your strength, and your capabilities.  You are made up of so much more.  Join the movement and share what you weigh. 💛💪🏼👩🏽‍⚕️👩🏼‍⚖️💃🏼🏄🏽‍♀️🎒🧘🏼‍♀️🏋🏼‍♀️⛑🔭📘🦠

Especially men. Like equality in family court, like when wages are equal the question of men paying more for shared expenses goes away, like in an equality based society, men have MORE job and life opportunities because there is no stigma and wages are equal. I don’t understand why men don’t see the advantages of feminism. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯|NICE AESTHETIC TEXTPOSTS FINALLY|“Public good”|End feminism|Just give me your money. Boom. I’m the public.|Well we better not see a dollar of it in America and other 1st world countries.|Dumb bitch could’ve donated that to ocean clean up and fighting climate change.|Theres literraly perfect equality in america. Why give it a billion dollars when our planet is dying you know, that thing a bit more important than man spreading and women that work at buzzfeed|😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂|Planning to use his* money. There, I fixed it.|Nothing says Gender Equality like spending your husbands money|Feminism is bullshit now it used to actually mean something and now it's just women complaining that they aren't doing better then men|Hehe, rich people only give to charity bc of tax reduction.|The money should be used to fund the construction of enough guillotines for all the billionaires in the world|Fund education for economically disadvantaged women.",1827
149,149,"About a year ago, I broke and sprained my ankle while at a party.  Trying to look after myself and just doing everyday things such as, making a cup of tea while on crutches became impossible. Having to spend all day on my own was lonely and made me pretty depressed. 
One night while coming back from trying to buy my dinner I fell trying to open a door, smashing my phone and completely losing it. I was sat on the floor, sobbing for about an hour. 
I was struggling to get home and totally overwhelmed by the fact that everything I loved; running, yoga, kayaking, dancing and going partying was out of the question for the foreseeable future. Not to mention, feeling stressed because of all the lectures and work at uni I was going to miss. I was in trouble physically, mentally and emotionally and didn’t want anyone to know I wasn’t okay. I wanted to be seen as ‘strong’, so I didn’t ask for help.

I am now grateful that I broke my ankle which sounds weird but I learnt an incredibly important lesson. I learnt it’s OKAY not to be okay, to be vulnerable. Having a break down and not being able to cope doesn’t mean you aren’t strong. Asking for help when you can’t cope doesn’t make you weak. You are so much braver for admitting you need help than hiding it away like I tried to. 
So this #wellnesswednesday I want you to know, whatever pain or struggle you are going through, if you find yourself asking for help you are SO incredibly brave and I think you’re amazing. You don’t need to be strong all the time. It is okay not to be okay and it is more than okay to ask for help. 💚",yesallwomen,"|#vulnerabilityisstrength  #support #girl #women #yesallwomen #ibelieveyou #strongwomen  #selfcare #selflove #selfworth|Well said🙌|You’re so cute|Beautifully said ☺️❤️|proud of you love you so so much xxx|Beautiful 💚|You said it girl, couldn't of said it better and you're totally right. Often asking for help is braver than concurring it all alone💚|Allowing others to help is a sign of self awareness and inner strength; 2 very important character traits. Lovely message, Rachel. 💚",73

I know sometimes you get tired or feel discouraged not knowing how it's all going to turn out. but never for a moment deform your imagination by harboring doubts about your ability to succeed, whenever you do this, you weaken the force that drives you to reach your goals. But you see all these are part of the process. Trust it, Because it's going to '' END IN PRAISE '' Always have the mindset of a WINNER ❤

Toxic and normative masculinity also limits and harms boys and men, especially those who don’t adhere to traditional gender roles and stereotypes.

Here it is. I always wanted to be a mom. When I was in a previous long term relationship prior to finding my amazing partner, I thought that person was the end all and be all and I thought I wanted to have all the babies with this person, but I also felt something in my heart that things weren't right. After being with this person for years people kept asking me when we were going to have babies. With me being so conflicted these questions would sometimes bring me to tears. Fast forward to me now. I found the perfect partner that also wanted to have babies and boy did we. 16 years later we have 5 amazing babies and after we had our third baby in three years we had EVERYBODY and their mother making comments about how many babies we had. When the twins came it was even worse. I have even gotten questions from COMPLETE strangers about whether or not my kids shared the same father.  WTF! Stop doing this. Stay. Out. Of. Women's. Pussy.

Like please take a breath, we don’t have to have kids immediately. But the truth is I had a miscarriage 2 months after I got married and every time someone asked when I was going to have a baby it was devastating to me. And then after I did have a baby people started asking when the next one was coming, and again I had a miscarriage (both of my twins) and again it was heartbreaking every time people asked. Wish people would mind their own business on the matter.|I used to get asked that ALL THE TIME!!! It was hurtful especially when my mother said if I don’t have any it’s because God doesn’t feel I deserve them “no te lo mereces” were her exact words.

He didn't consent. He was barely awake. And men laughed in his face when he was going to report it. So he didn't. I also knew a friend of mine was raped by his babysitter when he was 5. Saying that men must always enjoy sex implies that women don't. Sex is supposed to be mutually pleasurable for BOTH parties involved. It should never be one person enjoying it. It should never be one person doing what they want while the other suffers. It shouldn't be a chore or coerced into doing it. Why can't we glorify sex for both? Why must it be focused on male pleasure? This is why most women detest porn or erotica because literally the man and his wants/needs are the main focus. We don't generally see the girls ever finish either; it's not usually described in pure detail. We don't see the man working hard to pleasure her. It's ""oh he finished we're done here."" And That's toxic in itself. And a part of the problem.|how did the kid get a boner at knife point tho, like how tf does that work",390

198,198,"So I don’t know WTF is up with 2019, but I keep saying there’s something in the water. Everywhere I turn, one of my friends, family members, or coworkers are shaking up their lives and making big moves.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
My roommate and her sweet pup were the most recent to hit the road and move across the country. I miss them so much already, and can’t help but feel like this is the end of an era. I recognize all of the exciting things ahead in my own life, but still feel a bit nostalgic about the wine nights, heart-to-hearts, and bike rides that are no more.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
In these times of change, I find myself retreating to my familiar pattern of reclaiming my space and attempting to take control of my own routines. I don’t know completely why I do it, but getting everything (at least somewhat) in line in my own life empowers me to think of it like a fresh start.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
If it’s a change I feel in my work, I start going through the places and spaces where my work lives. I declutter my inbox, clear my desktop, and outline projects with extensive to-do lists. If I’m dealing with personal change, I’ll deep clean and rearrange — like I’m doing now at home. There’s nothing like new decor and clean countertops to find the void, right?⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Change is tough, but reclaiming spaces as my own and giving myself a new mindset seems to help. How do you approach life changes both big and small? —Morgan #babeswhohustle⁠⠀",yesallwomen,"|.⁣⠀

In your teens before marriage and your 30s in your 40s when you’re older? If you listen to society and its dictates it’s probably never going to be OK… except for maybe when you are deemed the property of a husband and you only have sex with him to have his children. 💀 So you decide!!!

——————————————————————————
“If there is a word that should be retired from use in the service of women’s expression, health, well-being, and equality, it is ‘appropriate’ - a sloppy, mushy word that purports to convey some important moral essence but in reality is just a policing term used to regulate our language, appearance, and demands. It’s a control word. 
We are done with control.” ——————————————————————————
“Saying ‘I am angry’ is a necessary first step to ‘Listen.’ ‘Believe me.’ ‘Trust me.’ ‘I know.’ ‘Time to do something.’ When a girl or woman is angry, she is saying ‘What I am feeling, thinking, and saying matters...’ This is the real danger of our anger: it makes it clear that we take ourselves seriously... The truth is that anger isn’t what gets in our way - it IS our way. All we have to do is own it.” ——————————————————————————@sorayachemaly #ragebecomesher #yesallwomen #feminism #bookstagram #booksandbeans",yesallwomen,|but what I want to know is ... is that cocoa? ;-)|...#OUTrage is what I like to say rather than use I am angry. #ragebecomesher|I love the quote “it [anger] makes it clear that we take ourselves seriously.” This really is a first and necessary step. 💛💛💛,70

Thank you so much Diana for your beautiful review! Check out her review below: 
_
""Listening to the podcast made me think about my own career and women in tech in general from a few new or forgotten angles. All these topics covered in the first episodes resonate with me on so many different levels - from non-traditional career path to struggles with women supporting each other in tech. I am very happy that this podcast is not only focused on tech side, but there are also wellbeing and life balance aspects that Tamara talks about. My personal priority is always to have that balance between 10 h workday, healthy lifestyle and relationships. Listening to these few first episodes made me think about my personal life choices in achieving the balance and if I am actually successful in it. I personally always struggled to maintain my personal relationships with friends and family, and it's definitely good to hear someone else talking about it and maybe even get some ideas on how to fix something I am struggling with. This woman is a gem, she motivates me and gives me hope that I can achieve a lot more. I am very happy I discovered that podcast, and cant wait to listen to the next and the next.""

Maybe the problem is you.|👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯💯💯💯💯👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼|I used to be a Firefighter EMT I would tell my family members and friends when they are asked when are you going to have a baby or they have been pregnant and some stranger asks ”your first”? This what you say the Latin name for Pregnant is Para for Live birth Gravida so a woman who is pregnant is Para if she has prior children say 2 kids the reply would be the woman is Para 1 Gravada 2. So ladies depending on if this is your first pregnancy you would answer I'm Para 1 Gravada 0 and so on and so forth. And if your not pregnant and it's none of their business just say I have chosen to stay Para 0 for now. You will leave them speechless as you smile and walk away😊|Because it’s a choice 🤯🤯|OOF- I feel this...|@tz3vi @hayleyyjade  exactly what we were talking about!|@_amandajkemp|✊✊👏👏💜💜🖤🖤|@lizzzmilan yesss!!|Thank you|I agree it’s no ones business, especially given the circumstances one might be in, but what if there are more of us that can find a way to open up and educate people. There is a lot ignorance from many about the reasons why one might not want to or be able to or is waiting to whatever the question. I decided to share my why for many of these questions that can be, & have at one point been offensive to me. I‘ve come across a majority people who really just don’t know about the current situations many people are in. They come from a place of their own upbringing and some without an open mind. I want to educate them & open their minds with my story whether they like it or not. It brings me joy to have someone want to learn more. If they don’t care or are just to close minded, well to hell with them, BUT I’ve planted a seed.|Bruh moment|Yes, I wish this slide was around 35 years ago. #exhausting #presumptuous #endometriosis|Fucking 💯!! Go fuck off I’m am BUSY!!|I don't see why someone would have to make such a fuss over a question. A simple ""I am not planning to have kids at this time,"" or ""I am unable to have kids."" Would suffice as an answer. If they keep persisting, ignore the question.|You guys know your the only ones who can have them right? 😐 Why would I ask anyone else??|Yeah, okay, but when?|Do you women get asked about this randomly? Like first words upon introduction?? Cuz that's what you all make it sound like.|Oh the heartache of this question. The temptation to be snarky was so real.|@taryn.onody didn’t you write a post along these lines?  Great minds.|And because women are more than baby making machines!|Because I’m 23 years old and my partner and I want to live our lives before settling down!!|@laurahanzal|And stop asking women’s mothers when they are going to be a grandparent. Argh.|Because I don't 100% identify as female and pregnancy is literally terrifying|I’d also argue that talking about relationship life unless someone is close. I hate when people tell me “you’re good looking, you must have a lot of men”. A lot of people are gay, asexual, aromantic, don’t want to date, or feel awkward talking about relationships. There’s a ton more reasons for this, I just wish strangers or family members who aren’t close would stop talking about it unless they want to talk about themselves and their experiences.|I'll be sure not to be happy for them then, the fuck 😂|Ok I understand the reasons here but couldn’t this apply to any situation?|PCOS? What does that mean|@shelleydalton81 something similar to our lunch time conversation today|Same goes for men, too. Stop asking them when they're gonna have a girlfriend/marry/have a family. It's none of your business as well|The correct word order is ...when they are...|Same goes for men, too. Stop asking them when they're gonna have a girlfriend/marry/have a family. It's none of your business as well|Heck don’t ask questions at all how dare we show interest in each other’s lives 🙄|Because they can think of something far more imaginative to do with their lives|@megdamohammad 🙄|A-fukn-men!!!! 💯|sluts|Aight but like.....when ya getting pregnant?|Please, for the love of god, stop tagging this #aesthetictextpost|Yeah sorry for asking women when they’ll do the natural thing they’re born for. Same with men, stop asking people anything don’t show interest in their life at all.|Hell to the yes!!!! Thank you!!!|When am I getting pregnant? Idk, Sharon, when are you going to fuck all the way off? 😂😂😂|For real! Maybe she can't have children. Maybe she doesn't want them. Either way, it's none of your business. And it's insensitive to ask. You don't know what you might be triggering.|Why are you still showing up in my (and other non feminists’) feed? Stop hash tagging non feminist hashtags, it almost seems like you’re trying to upset people and cause argument.|Imagine having an opinion that is so unbelievably stupid and then posting it on insta 🤡🤡|Yes, do not show any interest in something many women do whatsoever. Even if a woman does want kids. Make no eye contact. Do not breathe near her. Walk away before she sees you.|Shhhhh, no one cares|Who asks this shit but family😭😭, like I'm just gonna vwalk up to a co-worker and say ""when you popping a baby out"" 😭😭|Imagine getting butthurt because someone asks if you're gonna have kids🤣🤣|Who asks that|This is 100% not aesthetic|Although... Isn't asking women if they are pregnant also equally bad?|I didn’t know this was a thing. I better get with it and start asking. Lol|@csmith0529|@clairebear2004|Because adopt or pop.|You're right, stop asking when and telling them when!|Or asexual like meeeeeeee|why is this in the aesthetic textpost hashtag,,|Yes! And I would add stillbirth to this list as well.|The thought of having another living human growing inside of me makes me hella uncomfortable :,) and besides, I don’t have the patience for a kid and I won’t treat them right|@kaylaa.dan|- because they have a genetic disorder/disease and dont want to pass it on to their kids|Because I don't want my kids to suffer mental illness like I do, I would much rather save an unwanted child than mentally damage my own|I have tokophobia, I can't ever imagine having children.|I never want to have biological kids because I would have to stop my antidepressants and I genuinely don't think I'd be able to handle that. Plus the risk of post-partum depression on top of it. I couldn't handle it.|- because they don't exist just for the purpose of having children anymore. It's 2019 Karen.|I agree it is none of their business but it is the duty of all life to reproduce so women should seriously think about that more|Because climate change.",9618

⁣
This does NOT mean that during day 1, for example, only young ladies are welcome!! It simply means that each day the selection of workshops is guided by the energy of that day:⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👄 the Maiden’s playfulness, self-discovery, innocence, and curiosity,⁣⁣
👑 the Queen’s motherhood, independence, strength, and confidence,⁣⁣
🧙🏻‍♀️and the Crone’s calm, patience, resilience, and wisdom.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
We believe every woman has loads to learn from the wisdom and vitality found in all three stages. The sessions each day will correspond to the questions, issues, and curiosities of the body, mind, and soul for each of the three archetypes. MWF’s greatest beauty will be in bringing together a community of women of all life stages to share their stories and their wisdom, so that we can all leave feeling supported and connected to a gorgeous new tribe. ♥️⁣⁣

Are you ready to see the full festival schedule? The full schedule will be published here After this post gathers 100 likes. Let’s make it happen! ⁣

“To the extent that we can characterize evolution as designing our modern brains, this is what our brains were wired for: reaching out to and interacting with others,” writes neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman in his book Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect. “These social adaptations are central to making us the most successful species on earth.”⁠

Through violence, terror, and humiliation I was transformed. • Ten years ago, the bleak emptiness that I was left with, seemed impenetrable and my annihilation from any sort of normal existence, inevitable. • Ten years ago, I had no idea that life went on. • Ten years ago, I was a victim. • TODAY, I AM A SURVIVOR. ||| #sasurvivor #yesallwomen #mystory #sexualassaultsurvivor #hedidntwin",yesallwomen,"|❤️❤️❤️|❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|You are incredible.

You're also not going to find a white polar bear in the WOODS. Also you should read the original stories because goldilocks got eaten by the bears|Ahah yes, cartoons promote white previelege|The bears ate the bitch ‘‘tis a tale of justice|That's probably cos she wasn't in the arctic but in a forest?|Ok but what if not all whites are racist and actually gave two shits about other races? I feel like most people look at us as a whole group of the same attitude when it comes to racism. I, myself, just like to have friends at the end of the day no matter what color, and if anyone else wants to disrespect my friend for that or any other dumb reason, I will personally beat the shit out of them. If you treat me badly or with disrespect, yes, I will have an issue, but if you respect me I will do that right back. What happened recently in Dallas with the cop and the guy she shot (who was black), I did not like the cop at all, I did not believe she didn’t have any other motive than “I walked into the wrong apartment and thought it was mine and he was a robber” and I DO think she deserves more than 10 years, I don’t know if white privilege is a thing or not because I didn’t even know about such a thing until I found it on social media, but from how many years they give most white people who have done awful things, or just a slap on the wrist, I do agree that is so wrong, so wrong. They had protesters wanting her in jail longer than 10 years, and part of me wanted to go down there and protest with them. Because yes, I see how unfair it is for a lot of other races, and no I don’t think I’d ever understand completely because I have never been a victim of issues they’ve dealt with way too much. But, I still would like to help in anyway I can.|Uh I don’t think so|This is absolutely untrue. In the story I was read as a child the bears find her and eat her. The story is actually ment to scare children so they dont go into other people's houses uninvited.|Very old stories seem to be told in various versions and take on many even contrasting meanings. Whithin the context of white supremacy this reading feels accurate. In the forested land of my grandfather’s childhood it would have been absolute craziness not to visit a house you see when lost in the woods. Maybe because it was written down in the 1820’s Britain, it was stressed how rude it is to seek refuge among strangers. But the whole story is ambivalent, mysterious. Is there a real, true meaning behind it at all? Or is it fully up to the listener?|Omfg I forgot this story existed holy shit|😂😂😂😂😊💀💀|Imagine saying that white people play the victim yet crying about their supposed “privilege” in the exact same post lmao.😂|Is this a joke?|Whites rule 🤘|Sounds more like femenism|@daughterofpapa|Damn... never thought about it that way. Probably why I hated this story as a kid!|Personally I think this is a better example of illegal immigration. Coming into a different persons home, eating their food and taking their resources and stuff. Then get shitty when they don’t accommodate you.|Facts|@fembotmag Why did you make it a race thing you have made it racist even though it isn’t it’s a fucking kids story you fucking cretin|Wow what a fucking reach|Crazy how we learn these as kids, and when we’re older our minds kinda click. “This isn’t right..”|@katiej0730 @ebenson72|What in the reach...the fuck|Breaking and Entering litte Girl, You should be In Prison|I hated this story bc she was being mean to the bears. what a reach im-|BAHHAHAHHAHAH|This would be hysterical except that it's idiotic!|Lmao this one is reaching for sure. I like where your head is at though white privilege is in everything|None of the stories ever said that Goldilocks was white. Just that she had gold curly hair.|@marlee_wells|Mother f#cker😎|The bears then eat her tho|You are racist because you compare brown people to bears so you are saying that brown people are mindless beasts.|Lol that's funny|🤣 @thisiskenia_|I don’t think it’s about black people, I just think it’s about killing and eating intruders which in my opinion should be legal to at least rid yourself of the burglar. I don’t think the eating part would be very popular.|Is this serious or is this a meme?|I- do people really think this is racist?-|issa children’s story lol|😂sure|Ahh never thought it that way...thanks for sharing|It's a nursery rhyme, your actively searching for racist undertones|This is ridiculous|How so? Is someone willing to explain how to me|This isn’t a #aesthetictextpost ? Why tf is this shit in my feed? 💀 gtfo.|i love how the op said “and all against brown bears” as if a white bear is the first thing that pops in mind when you say a bear. not only that, a brown bear is a type of bear? like i’m sorry next time they’ll live in igloos|🤯|bruh its really not that deep|it's,,,, it's a fucking childrens story, THEY'RE B E A R S NOT MEXICANS|It’s a fucking kids story stfu|That's honestly retarded lmao, hope it's satire|😱|Damn shots fired!!!😂😂😂|🤦‍♀️The moral of that story was to respect other people's property...|Imagine virtue signalling so hard you compare minorities to ravenous inhuman bears|It’s a children’s book why do you people have to do this with everything|Imagine being so fucking stupid you get pressed over this very obvious joke.|Y’all really be doing the most. Why y’all comparing y’all selves to animals?|Y’all really be doing the most. Why y’all comparing y’all selves to animals?|I honestly think it's just a child story, it's not that deep.|@chelseahandler|Yall need to chill|Okay I’m a mega feminist but y’all being a little dramatic it’s not that deep 💀💀|All the white people are so mad|i|I mean, in the original tale they ate her bc the moral was to never use/touch anybody else's things without asking bc there'll be consequences but ok|I thought this was a joke at first. Realizing now you’re serious. Please stop. How do you experience happiness when you look at the world through such dramatic lenses.|Back in the day a bank in Sweden made a comic about two girls named ""Save"" and ""Waste"".

But the moral of this story is to not steal from others (they fucking eat Goldilocks in the original versions.)|It's just a children's story.... Trust me I understand the thought put into this but it's a bit of a stretch|Real talk|Very true!|Holy shit it’s a children’s story do u have to twist everything to stupidity 🤦‍♂️ bears that live in the forest are mostly brown that doesn’t make it racism 🤡 or would a fucking polar bear in the forest satisfy u|I thought it was a joke post-|Goldilocks...is...the villain in that story though. I suppose the versions you heard might be different, but never once did I feel like her behavior was being condoned.|Really? Why do you people have to turn everything into something racist or sexist or any other “ist” for that matter. Just leave it alone. It’s not a big fucking deal. And it’s an old story. Not to mention that the little girl is 1) looking for shelter

You may have seen the announcement that @MelindaFrenchGates is committing $1B to promote #genderequality because she ""wants to see more women in the position to make decisions, control resources, and shape policies and perspectives."" Swoon. 😍⁠
-⁠
When we think about why we have started #herfinanceday, this is exactly it!  Many of you following this account, already have resources - paying off your #studentloans or saving 1% more of your income, is more about setting you up to be wealthy (which means different things than different people). While being ""wealthy"" or having #money can feel like a dirty word, money is a source of financial security and power.  If the majority of people in position to give big philanthropic gifts like this one are MEN, the world will look very different than if #women and #girls have the power to fund their dreams.  We want to create a world where there is less distance from the bottom to the top of the pyramid - and that means creating paths to get more diverse faces (and more women!) to true wealth.  Thanks for inspiring us @MelindaFrenchGates on this #FinancialFeministFriday. 🌐 👭💰",yesallwomen,|#financialfeminist #walletfeminist #earnmore #philanthropy #girlboss #financialwellbeing #women2follow #strongertogether #successfulwomen #genderequity #womenempoweringwomen #feminist #feminism #askhermore #yesallwomen #womeninbiz #philanthropist #investlikeaWoman #genderpaygap #EqualityCantWait,24

However icky you feel about selling if people don’t know what you’re offering you can’t expect them to buy from you.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Learning how to sell in an authentic and non-sales-ey way can be easy + fun 👉 if you know how.....BUT I know how many women struggle with this because I was this woman 12 months ago. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Im here to tell you that there is a way to sell AND the best bit is, it doesn’t even feel like selling. 🙌
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The thing is you gotta share your offerings with your audience because you’re not doing it enough. Also a lot of the time they don’t even realise you have a service or product that they need! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Are you sharing your offerings enough? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

271,271,"Look, people are always going to have opinions about you, your choices, the way you express yourself and behave. Especially those who are unconscious. Especially those not sensitive to your feelings and sacred heart. Especially, those pesky armchair critics, who speak from a place of judgement instead of WISDOM.⁣
⁣
It is YOUR decision to allow them to mislead you, or to go with your gut. ⁣
⁣
It is YOUR choice, to listen to the noise, or listen to your heart, your inner child, your higher Self.⁣
⁣
There will be times when you are tested: perhaps you will allow yourself to be mislead but it's never too late to take your power back and say, ""This is not my way. This is not in alignment with me or how I chose to live my life."" ⁣
⁣
As women, we are naturally more in tune with our emotions, very naturally intuitive, and yet, people are always questioning our intuition, conditioning us to still contain it, suppress our wild, not think for ourselves, and continue to be objects for control and pleasure.⁣
⁣
Because a wild, intuitive woman is a dangerous woman (to patriarchal society.)⁣
⁣
What I'm telling you is that YOUR intuition will ALWAYS be right. Trust yourself enough to listen to it, and act from that place of authenticity and Truth. ⁣
⁣
And so it is.⁣
⁣
Blessings beautiful ones,⁣

“Standing behind predators makes prey of us all.” DaShanne Stokes⁣
⁣
“Well, when she dresses like that, she’s asking for it!”⁣⁣
⁣⁣
You’re right - she IS indeed asking for it! Every single time! ⁣Guaranteed! ⁣⁣
She’s asking for it when: ⁣⁣
- she’s dressed in “revealing” clothing;⁣⁣
- she’s wearing her hair loose and bouncy, her red lipstick bright across her lips;⁣⁣
- she’s worked for years trying to make a career for herself and is in a meeting with her superior hoping for her next big break;⁣⁣
- she’s sitting at her desk, minding her own business, and gets called in to the office for a “chat”;⁣⁣
- she returns a smile to someone across the room, while sitting with friends at the bar;⁣⁣
- she owns the dance floor when she’s on it, her body one with the music; ⁣⁣
- she kisses someone after the first/second/seventh date; ⁣⁣
- she walks home alone after work;⁣⁣
- she paints her nails with a special nail polish that helps determine if her drink has been spiked;⁣⁣
- she’s home with an acquaintance / a new partner / a long-time spouse; ⁣⁣
- she walks down the street, goes to the gym, goes for a coffee, does her grocery shopping, goes to the beach, plays sport, stands still, walks fast, when she’s alone, when she’s with friends, in the morning, at night. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Every single time she is absolutely asking for it! Without fail. Guaranteed. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
What she’s asking for, though, is not what we are told! What she’s asking for are not the outcomes steeped in the rhetoric of a patriarchal and archaic system - with its outdated and misogynistic views. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Continued in comments...or through link in bio.",yesallwomen,"|(... continued 1) ⁣
⁣
What she IS asking for is to have the safety and freedom to go about her life without the threat that she will be verbally, physically, emotionally or sexually harassed and abused in some way. ⁣
⁣
She IS asking to be taken seriously for being intelligent, strong, capable and talented.⁣
⁣
She IS asking to be seen for more than her body parts, more than a sexual object, more than a thing. ⁣
⁣
She IS asking for the simple respect that should come with her being a human being. ⁣
⁣
Women have to work so hard for all these things, because they are *still* not a given. Indeed, they’re often blatantly withheld from them, violently denied and murderously extinguished. ⁣
⁣
To be clear: ⁣
⁣
Women are not asking to live their life wondering if what they’re wearing will be considered the “wrong thing” in a court of law. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to walk home at night tightly clutching pepper spray or fashioning car keys into weapons between their fingers. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to be catcalled, felt up, harassed, followed home, stalked, threatened, abused, raped, murdered. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to be called liars because it can take years to find the courage to call out their harasser.|(... continued 2) ⁣
⁣
Maybe it’s time we stop blaming the women of the world; as though they are to blame for not behaving in the ways that would keep them safe. Let’s stop pointing the finger at them each and every time they are harassed, raped and murdered simply for risking to walk out of their front door - and, often, not even having to do that! ⁣
⁣
Disgraced “comedian” Louis C. K. once did a stand up about how unsafe women are in the world (and should expect to be unsafe), simply for the fact that they are women. He said that it was a given that women would be harassed because they are women. And he laughed and laughed! I did not. I found it disgusting, degrading and extremely non-humorous. That’s a vile view to hold of women. ⁣
⁣
We need to continue to shine light on the system that propagates its misogynistic views and supports the violence and violations against women. ⁣
⁣
We ARE asking for it. We are asking for respect and the right to live a life of safety and freedom that is not only our human right, but our very birth right! ⁣|....................................

This doesn’t go to say that white people in history oppressed literally every race BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED! I STILL EXPERIENCE RACISM AS A HALF INDIAN HALF LATINA MINORITY and I feel the effects of anti minority politics but we gotta see that things are bettering. Being white isn’t racist, what’s racist is NOT RECOGNIZING YOUR PRIVILEGE AND HURTING PEOPLE! But literally every single white person who’s commented that they were called racist SAID that they recognize their privilege and I 100% applaud you for that, having privilege is out of anyone’s control and recognizing it is a very important step to take! All races are valid💗 🌍 🌎 .
RACISM, SEXISM, SEGREGATION, ETC STILL EXISTS
We are not perfect and our world is far from it, but actively the world is making lots of change (in some places more than others).
White people surely are still more privileged and superior but I know that so many of them are doing good with their privilege.
We can see horrible examples of racist people with CERTAIN presidents administrations but we can also find a lot of good In others. The world isn’t perfect, politicians aren’t perfect, but we are a changing dynamic society .

Calling all Crones, ladies who support Crones, ladies supported by Crones, and ladies who will one day be Crones! ⁣⁣
...So…⁣⁣
Calling all women! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The third and final day of #MWF_2019 will celebrate the Crone archetype of older, wise-women with the help of crone, sagewoman, and artist, Katie Flowers. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Katie’s session, Sagewomen - De-scaring the Crone Archetype through Art, will celebrate your journey and life of stories. This workshop is a place to discuss, consider, and make art featuring your life experiences and all of their beautiful, unsettling, liberating, and curious facets. Utilising the stories attained through years of experience, each attendee will craft a set of 2-D Russian Nesting Matryoshka dolls which stack to represent her whole self. Attendees will paint each segment to illustrate each stage of life, and the richness of experiences within. Katie will help us to explore and take pride in our myriad of past roles, and gloriously manifest our wise present-day self.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Women of any age who respect and honor the Crone archetype will find beauty in this art workshop, so please connect to the ancient female energy stirring within you and join us!⁣⁣

Here it is. I always wanted to be a mom. When I was in a previous long term relationship prior to finding my amazing partner, I thought that person was the end all and be all and I thought I wanted to have all the babies with this person, but I also felt something in my heart that things weren't right. After being with this person for years people kept asking me when we were going to have babies. With me being so conflicted these questions would sometimes bring me to tears. Fast forward to me now. I found the perfect partner that also wanted to have babies and boy did we. 16 years later we have 5 amazing babies and after we had our third baby in three years we had EVERYBODY and their mother making comments about how many babies we had. When the twins came it was even worse. I have even gotten questions from COMPLETE strangers about whether or not my kids shared the same father.  WTF! Stop doing this. Stay. Out. Of. Women's. Pussy. Business. Stay. Our|Stay. Out. Of. People's. Genital. And. Reproductive. Business. #WhatIDoWithMyPussyIsMyBusiness #WhoILetInMyPussyIsMyBusiness.|Because if they say they don't want any (more) children and then change their minds down the road or wind up pregnant accidentally it's not something they should be judged for.|Also, when people ask me about this I find that going into disgusting detail about my unprotected (or protected) sexcapades and my menstrual cycle typically shuts them up.|🙏🏼Amen!!!|You will always be judged by others, despite what you think or feel. The world doesn't change, it's a matter of acceptance and forgiveness within self.|People started asking me when I was having kids AS SOON AS I GOT MARRIED. Like please take a breath, we don’t have to have kids immediately. But the truth is I had a miscarriage 2 months after I got married and every time someone asked when I was going to have a baby it was devastating to me. And then after I did have a baby people started asking when the next one was coming, and again I had a miscarriage (both of my twins) and again it was heartbreaking every time people asked.

He didn't consent. He was barely awake. And men laughed in his face when he was going to report it. So he didn't. I also knew a friend of mine was raped by his babysitter when he was 5. Saying that men must always enjoy sex implies that women don't. Sex is supposed to be mutually pleasurable for BOTH parties involved. It should never be one person enjoying it. It should never be one person doing what they want while the other suffers. It shouldn't be a chore or coerced into doing it. Why can't we glorify sex for both? Why must it be focused on male pleasure? This is why most women detest porn or erotica because literally the man and his wants/needs are the main focus. We don't generally see the girls ever finish either; it's not usually described in pure detail. We don't see the man working hard to pleasure her. It's ""oh he finished we're done here."" And That's toxic in itself. And a part of the problem.|how did the kid get a boner at knife point tho, like how tf does that work",390

315,16,"So I don’t know WTF is up with 2019, but I keep saying there’s something in the water. Everywhere I turn, one of my friends, family members, or coworkers are shaking up their lives and making big moves.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
My roommate and her sweet pup were the most recent to hit the road and move across the country. I miss them so much already, and can’t help but feel like this is the end of an era. I recognize all of the exciting things ahead in my own life, but still feel a bit nostalgic about the wine nights, heart-to-hearts, and bike rides that are no more.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
In these times of change, I find myself retreating to my familiar pattern of reclaiming my space and attempting to take control of my own routines. I don’t know completely why I do it, but getting everything (at least somewhat) in line in my own life empowers me to think of it like a fresh start.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
If it’s a change I feel in my work, I start going through the places and spaces where my work lives. I declutter my inbox, clear my desktop, and outline projects with extensive to-do lists. If I’m dealing with personal change, I’ll deep clean and rearrange — like I’m doing now at home. There’s nothing like new decor and clean countertops to find the void, right?⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Change is tough, but reclaiming spaces as my own and giving myself a new mindset seems to help. How do you approach life changes both big and small? —Morgan #babeswhohustle⁠⠀",yesallwomen,"|.⁣⠀

In your teens before marriage and your 30s in your 40s when you’re older?

——————————————————————————
“If there is a word that should be retired from use in the service of women’s expression, health, well-being, and equality, it is ‘appropriate’ - a sloppy, mushy word that purports to convey some important moral essence but in reality is just a policing term used to regulate our language, appearance, and demands. It’s a control word. 
We are done with control.” ——————————————————————————
“Saying ‘I am angry’ is a necessary first step to ‘Listen.’ ‘Believe me.’ ‘Trust me.’ ‘I know.’ ‘Time to do something.’ When a girl or woman is angry, she is saying ‘What I am feeling, thinking, and saying matters...’ This is the real danger of our anger: it makes it clear that we take ourselves seriously... The truth is that anger isn’t what gets in our way - it IS our way. All we have to do is own it.” ——————————————————————————@sorayachemaly #ragebecomesher #yesallwomen #feminism #bookstagram #booksandbeans",yesallwomen,|but what I want to know is ... is that cocoa? ;-)|...#OUTrage is what I like to say rather than use I am angry. #ragebecomesher|I love the quote “it [anger] makes it clear that we take ourselves seriously.” This really is a first and necessary step. 💛💛💛,70

Thank you so much Diana for your beautiful review! Check out her review below: 
_
""Listening to the podcast made me think about my own career and women in tech in general from a few new or forgotten angles. All these topics covered in the first episodes resonate with me on so many different levels - from non-traditional career path to struggles with women supporting each other in tech. I am very happy that this podcast is not only focused on tech side, but there are also wellbeing and life balance aspects that Tamara talks about. My personal priority is always to have that balance between 10 h workday, healthy lifestyle and relationships. Listening to these few first episodes made me think about my personal life choices in achieving the balance and if I am actually successful in it. I personally always struggled to maintain my personal relationships with friends and family, and it's definitely good to hear someone else talking about it and maybe even get some ideas on how to fix something I am struggling with. This woman is a gem, she motivates me and gives me hope that I can achieve a lot more. I am very happy I discovered that podcast, and cant wait to listen to the next and the next.""

Maybe the problem is you.|👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯💯💯💯💯👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼|I used to be a Firefighter EMT I would tell my family members and friends when they are asked when are you going to have a baby or they have been pregnant and some stranger asks ”your first”? This what you say the Latin name for Pregnant is Para for Live birth Gravida so a woman who is pregnant is Para if she has prior children say 2 kids the reply would be the woman is Para 1 Gravada 2. So ladies depending on if this is your first pregnancy you would answer I'm Para 1 Gravada 0 and so on and so forth. And if your not pregnant and it's none of their business just say I have chosen to stay Para 0 for now. You will leave them speechless as you smile and walk away😊|Because it’s a choice 🤯🤯|OOF- I feel this...|@tz3vi @hayleyyjade  exactly what we were talking about!|@_amandajkemp|✊✊👏👏💜💜🖤🖤|@lizzzmilan yesss!!|Thank you|I agree it’s no ones business, especially given the circumstances one might be in, but what if there are more of us that can find a way to open up and educate people. There is a lot ignorance from many about the reasons why one might not want to or be able to or is waiting to whatever the question. I decided to share my why for many of these questions that can be, & have at one point been offensive to me. I‘ve come across a majority people who really just don’t know about the current situations many people are in. They come from a place of their own upbringing and some without an open mind. I want to educate them & open their minds with my story whether they like it or not. It brings me joy to have someone want to learn more. If they don’t care or are just to close minded, well to hell with them, BUT I’ve planted a seed.|Bruh moment|Yes, I wish this slide was around 35 years ago. #exhausting #presumptuous #endometriosis|Fucking 💯!! Go fuck off I’m am BUSY!!|I don't see why someone would have to make such a fuss over a question. A simple ""I am not planning to have kids at this time,"" or ""I am unable to have kids."" Would suffice as an answer. If they keep persisting, ignore the question.|You guys know your the only ones who can have them right? 😐 Why would I ask anyone else??|Yeah, okay, but when?|Do you women get asked about this randomly? Like first words upon introduction?? Cuz that's what you all make it sound like.|Oh the heartache of this question. The temptation to be snarky was so real.|@taryn.onody didn’t you write a post along these lines?  Great minds.|And because women are more than baby making machines!|Because I’m 23 years old and my partner and I want to live our lives before settling down!!|@laurahanzal|And stop asking women’s mothers when they are going to be a grandparent. Argh.|Because I don't 100% identify as female and pregnancy is literally terrifying|I’d also argue that talking about relationship life unless someone is close. I hate when people tell me “you’re good looking, you must have a lot of men”. A lot of people are gay, asexual, aromantic, don’t want to date, or feel awkward talking about relationships. There’s a ton more reasons for this, I just wish strangers or family members who aren’t close would stop talking about it unless they want to talk about themselves and their experiences.|I'll be sure not to be happy for them then, the fuck 😂|Ok I understand the reasons here but couldn’t this apply to any situation?|PCOS? What does that mean|@shelleydalton81 something similar to our lunch time conversation today|Same goes for men, too. Stop asking them when they're gonna have a girlfriend/marry/have a family. It's none of your business as well|The correct word order is ...when they are...|Same goes for men, too. Stop asking them when they're gonna have a girlfriend/marry/have a family. It's none of your business as well|Heck don’t ask questions at all how dare we show interest in each other’s lives 🙄|Because they can think of something far more imaginative to do with their lives|@megdamohammad 🙄|A-fukn-men!!!! 💯|sluts|Aight but like.....when ya getting pregnant?|Please, for the love of god, stop tagging this #aesthetictextpost|Yeah sorry for asking women when they’ll do the natural thing they’re born for. Same with men, stop asking people anything don’t show interest in their life at all.|Hell to the yes!!!! Thank you!!!|When am I getting pregnant? Idk, Sharon, when are you going to fuck all the way off? 😂😂😂|For real! Maybe she can't have children. Maybe she doesn't want them. Either way, it's none of your business. And it's insensitive to ask. You don't know what you might be triggering.|Why are you still showing up in my (and other non feminists’) feed? Stop hash tagging non feminist hashtags, it almost seems like you’re trying to upset people and cause argument.|Imagine having an opinion that is so unbelievably stupid and then posting it on insta 🤡🤡|Yes, do not show any interest in something many women do whatsoever. Even if a woman does want kids. Make no eye contact. Do not breathe near her. Walk away before she sees you.|Shhhhh, no one cares|Who asks this shit but family😭😭, like I'm just gonna vwalk up to a co-worker and say ""when you popping a baby out"" 😭😭|Imagine getting butthurt because someone asks if you're gonna have kids🤣🤣|Who asks that|This is 100% not aesthetic|Although... Isn't asking women if they are pregnant also equally bad?|I didn’t know this was a thing. I better get with it and start asking. Lol|@csmith0529|@clairebear2004|Because adopt or pop.|You're right, stop asking when and telling them when!|Or asexual like meeeeeeee|why is this in the aesthetic textpost hashtag,,|Yes! And I would add stillbirth to this list as well.|The thought of having another living human growing inside of me makes me hella uncomfortable :,) and besides, I don’t have the patience for a kid and I won’t treat them right|@kaylaa.dan|- because they have a genetic disorder/disease and dont want to pass it on to their kids|Because I don't want my kids to suffer mental illness like I do, I would much rather save an unwanted child than mentally damage my own|I have tokophobia, I can't ever imagine having children.|I never want to have biological kids because I would have to stop my antidepressants and I genuinely don't think I'd be able to handle that. Plus the risk of post-partum depression on top of it. I couldn't handle it.|- because they don't exist just for the purpose of having children anymore. It's 2019 Karen.|I agree it is none of their business but it is the duty of all life to reproduce so women should seriously think about that more|Because climate change.",9618

⁣
This does NOT mean that during day 1, for example, only young ladies are welcome!! It simply means that each day the selection of workshops is guided by the energy of that day:⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👄 the Maiden’s playfulness, self-discovery, innocence, and curiosity,⁣⁣
👑 the Queen’s motherhood, independence, strength, and confidence,⁣⁣
🧙🏻‍♀️and the Crone’s calm, patience, resilience, and wisdom.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
We believe every woman has loads to learn from the wisdom and vitality found in all three stages. The sessions each day will correspond to the questions, issues, and curiosities of the body, mind, and soul for each of the three archetypes. MWF’s greatest beauty will be in bringing together a community of women of all life stages to share their stories and their wisdom, so that we can all leave feeling supported and connected to a gorgeous new tribe. ♥️⁣⁣

Are you ready to see the full festival schedule? The full schedule will be published here After this post gathers 100 likes. Let’s make it happen! ⁣

“To the extent that we can characterize evolution as designing our modern brains, this is what our brains were wired for: reaching out to and interacting with others,” writes neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman in his book Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect. “These social adaptations are central to making us the most successful species on earth.”⁠

At the end of the day, they are off duty and get to take off their badge, making people see them not as cops. People of color however, don’t get to change the color of their skin at the end of the day, they have to live with danger that they never chose. Some police have shot and killed unarmed people of color and not been legally charged or convicted, meaning they technically got away with it. There’s no organization that kills police officers and gets away with it.|I'm confused why choosing a job to be in danger automatically insinuates that you're out to hurt ""people of color"" when the idea is to protect everyone? YOUR BRAINS ARE BACKWARDS.|I love some satire! Bravo|I love some satire!

It’s easy to play a victim.  If skin color dictated my future then this Compton raised Latino would have been another statistic instead of an educated individual and positive contributor to society.|And yet you want only the police to have guns... 🤡|Systems are orchestrated to produce the results they want. This includes the policing system and members of it are taught, directly and indirectly, to disregard the information that doesn’t align with their system. Regardless of what facts are available.|Thought this was gonna be respectful for police for choosing to protect society. Nope, of course not.|🙌🙌👏👏👏|If you believe this you’re stupid",5538
348,49,"The #MeToo movement has been a catalyst to where we are now- openly discussing rape culture and calling it out for what it is.⁠
⁠
But what now?⁠
⁠
We are at a cultural tipping point and in order for us to move forward and being able to say #NeverAgain, we need to actively and PROactively take measures to create #consentculture. ⁠

In this episode I talk about how we can do that- ALL of us!⁠

You're also not going to find a white polar bear in the WOODS. Also you should read the original stories because goldilocks got eaten by the bears|Ahah yes, cartoons promote white previelege|The bears ate the bitch ‘‘tis a tale of justice|That's probably cos she wasn't in the arctic but in a forest?|Ok but what if not all whites are racist and actually gave two shits about other races? I feel like most people look at us as a whole group of the same attitude when it comes to racism. I, myself, just like to have friends at the end of the day no matter what color, and if anyone else wants to disrespect my friend for that or any other dumb reason, I will personally beat the shit out of them. If you treat me badly or with disrespect, yes, I will have an issue, but if you respect me I will do that right back. What happened recently in Dallas with the cop and the guy she shot (who was black), I did not like the cop at all, I did not believe she didn’t have any other motive than “I walked into the wrong apartment and thought it was mine and he was a robber” and I DO think she deserves more than 10 years, I don’t know if white privilege is a thing or not because I didn’t even know about such a thing until I found it on social media, but from how many years they give most white people who have done awful things, or just a slap on the wrist, I do agree that is so wrong, so wrong. They had protesters wanting her in jail longer than 10 years, and part of me wanted to go down there and protest with them. Because yes, I see how unfair it is for a lot of other races, and no I don’t think I’d ever understand completely because I have never been a victim of issues they’ve dealt with way too much. But, I still would like to help in anyway I can.|Uh I don’t think so|This is absolutely untrue. In the story I was read as a child the bears find her and eat her. The story is actually ment to scare children so they dont go into other people's houses uninvited.|Very old stories seem to be told in various versions and take on many even contrasting meanings. Whithin the context of white supremacy this reading feels accurate. In the forested land of my grandfather’s childhood it would have been absolute craziness not to visit a house you see when lost in the woods. Maybe because it was written down in the 1820’s Britain, it was stressed how rude it is to seek refuge among strangers. But the whole story is ambivalent, mysterious. Is there a real, true meaning behind it at all? Or is it fully up to the listener?|Omfg I forgot this story existed holy shit|😂😂😂😂😊💀💀|Imagine saying that white people play the victim yet crying about their supposed “privilege” in the exact same post lmao.😂|Is this a joke?|Whites rule 🤘|Sounds more like femenism|@daughterofpapa|Damn... never thought about it that way.

But the moral of this story is to not steal from others (they fucking eat Goldilocks in the original versions.)|It's just a children's story.... Trust me I understand the thought put into this but it's a bit of a stretch|Real talk|Very true!|Holy shit it’s a children’s story do u have to twist everything to stupidity 🤦‍♂️ bears that live in the forest are mostly brown that doesn’t make it racism 🤡 or would a fucking polar bear in the forest satisfy u|I thought it was a joke post-|Goldilocks...is...the villain in that story though. I suppose the versions you heard might be different, but never once did I feel like her behavior was being condoned.|Really? Why do you people have to turn everything into something racist or sexist or any other “ist” for that matter. Just leave it alone. It’s not a big fucking deal. And it’s an old story. Not to mention that the little girl is 1) looking for shelter
2) unaware that the house isn’t abandoned because she’s a dumb little kid
3) she’s a kid for Christ’s sake! 
All of that would come into account if this story was non fiction. Which it isn’t! It’s Fictional. And the moral is to not fucking steal because it’s a dick thing to do and you’ll always eventually get caught. There is literally no problem with this story and yet you still try to play victim. Just let it go|Sorry, that's a reach.|White privilege in old Europe.  Dear lord.|Wait how is it white privilege. The way I remembered she broke into their house, used there shit, then when they came back she got kicked out and was portrayed as a dumbass.

Swoon. 😍⁠

When we think about why we have started #herfinanceday, this is exactly it!  Many of you following this account, already have resources - paying off your #studentloans or saving 1% more of your income, is more about setting you up to be wealthy (which means different things than different people). While being ""wealthy"" or having #money can feel like a dirty word, money is a source of financial security and power.  If the majority of people in position to give big philanthropic gifts like this one are MEN, the world will look very different than if #women and #girls have the power to fund their dreams.  We want to create a world where there is less distance from the bottom to the top of the pyramid - and that means creating paths to get more diverse faces (and more women!) to true wealth.

However icky you feel about selling if people don’t know what you’re offering you can’t expect them to buy from you.

Learning how to sell in an authentic and non-sales-ey way can be easy + fun 👉 if you know how.....BUT I know how many women struggle with this because I was this woman 12 months ago. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Im here to tell you that there is a way to sell AND the best bit is, it doesn’t even feel like selling. 🙌

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The thing is you gotta share your offerings with your audience because you’re not doing it enough. Also a lot of the time they don’t even realise you have a service or product that they need! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

388,89,"Look, people are always going to have opinions about you, your choices, the way you express yourself and behave. Especially those who are unconscious. Especially those not sensitive to your feelings and sacred heart. Especially, those pesky armchair critics, who speak from a place of judgement instead of WISDOM.⁣
⁣
It is YOUR decision to allow them to mislead you, or to go with your gut. ⁣
⁣
It is YOUR choice, to listen to the noise, or listen to your heart, your inner child, your higher Self.⁣
⁣
There will be times when you are tested: perhaps you will allow yourself to be mislead but it's never too late to take your power back and say, ""This is not my way. This is not in alignment with me or how I chose to live my life."" ⁣
⁣
As women, we are naturally more in tune with our emotions, very naturally intuitive, and yet, people are always questioning our intuition, conditioning us to still contain it, suppress our wild, not think for ourselves, and continue to be objects for control and pleasure.⁣
⁣
Because a wild, intuitive woman is a dangerous woman (to patriarchal society.)⁣
⁣
What I'm telling you is that YOUR intuition will ALWAYS be right. Trust yourself enough to listen to it, and act from that place of authenticity and Truth. ⁣
⁣
And so it is.⁣
⁣
Blessings beautiful ones,⁣

“Standing behind predators makes prey of us all.” DaShanne Stokes⁣
⁣
“Well, when she dresses like that, she’s asking for it!”⁣⁣
⁣⁣
You’re right - she IS indeed asking for it! Every single time! ⁣Guaranteed! ⁣⁣
She’s asking for it when: ⁣⁣
- she’s dressed in “revealing” clothing;⁣⁣
- she’s wearing her hair loose and bouncy, her red lipstick bright across her lips;⁣⁣
- she’s worked for years trying to make a career for herself and is in a meeting with her superior hoping for her next big break;⁣⁣
- she’s sitting at her desk, minding her own business, and gets called in to the office for a “chat”;⁣⁣
- she returns a smile to someone across the room, while sitting with friends at the bar;⁣⁣
- she owns the dance floor when she’s on it, her body one with the music; ⁣⁣
- she kisses someone after the first/second/seventh date; ⁣⁣
- she walks home alone after work;⁣⁣
- she paints her nails with a special nail polish that helps determine if her drink has been spiked;⁣⁣
- she’s home with an acquaintance / a new partner / a long-time spouse; ⁣⁣
- she walks down the street, goes to the gym, goes for a coffee, does her grocery shopping, goes to the beach, plays sport, stands still, walks fast, when she’s alone, when she’s with friends, in the morning, at night. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Every single time she is absolutely asking for it! Without fail. Guaranteed. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
What she’s asking for, though, is not what we are told! What she’s asking for are not the outcomes steeped in the rhetoric of a patriarchal and archaic system - with its outdated and misogynistic views. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Continued in comments...or through link in bio.",yesallwomen,"|(... continued 1) ⁣
⁣
What she IS asking for is to have the safety and freedom to go about her life without the threat that she will be verbally, physically, emotionally or sexually harassed and abused in some way. ⁣
⁣
She IS asking to be taken seriously for being intelligent, strong, capable and talented.⁣
⁣
She IS asking to be seen for more than her body parts, more than a sexual object, more than a thing. ⁣
⁣
She IS asking for the simple respect that should come with her being a human being. ⁣
⁣
Women have to work so hard for all these things, because they are *still* not a given. Indeed, they’re often blatantly withheld from them, violently denied and murderously extinguished. ⁣
⁣
To be clear: ⁣
⁣
Women are not asking to live their life wondering if what they’re wearing will be considered the “wrong thing” in a court of law. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to walk home at night tightly clutching pepper spray or fashioning car keys into weapons between their fingers. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to be catcalled, felt up, harassed, followed home, stalked, threatened, abused, raped, murdered. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to be called liars because it can take years to find the courage to call out their harasser.|(... continued 2) ⁣
⁣
Maybe it’s time we stop blaming the women of the world; as though they are to blame for not behaving in the ways that would keep them safe. Let’s stop pointing the finger at them each and every time they are harassed, raped and murdered simply for risking to walk out of their front door - and, often, not even having to do that! ⁣
⁣
Disgraced “comedian” Louis C. K. once did a stand up about how unsafe women are in the world (and should expect to be unsafe), simply for the fact that they are women. He said that it was a given that women would be harassed because they are women. And he laughed and laughed! I did not. I found it disgusting, degrading and extremely non-humorous. That’s a vile view to hold of women. ⁣
⁣
We need to continue to shine light on the system that propagates its misogynistic views and supports the violence and violations against women. ⁣
⁣
We ARE asking for it. We are asking for respect and the right to live a life of safety and freedom that is not only our human right, but our very birth right! ⁣|....................................

There is a major difference between sex and love but it takes love to actually know this information|Also waiting for a life mate is not a negative of sexuality it is the highest form of sexual praise - skewed thought on the part of the poster|Proud pansexual here",294

396,97,"I am not white but I get the comment too often that people are called racist for being white, like yes we all know racist white people but we also know racist people of ALL races. This doesn’t go to say that white people in history oppressed literally every race BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED! I STILL EXPERIENCE RACISM AS A HALF INDIAN HALF LATINA MINORITY and I feel the effects of anti minority politics but we gotta see that things are bettering. Being white isn’t racist, what’s racist is NOT RECOGNIZING YOUR PRIVILEGE AND HURTING PEOPLE! But literally every single white person who’s commented that they were called racist SAID that they recognize their privilege and I 100% applaud you for that, having privilege is out of anyone’s control and recognizing it is a very important step to take! All races are valid💗 🌍 🌎 .
RACISM, SEXISM, SEGREGATION, ETC STILL EXISTS
We are not perfect and our world is far from it, but actively the world is making lots of change (in some places more than others).
White people surely are still more privileged and superior but I know that so many of them are doing good with their privilege.
We can see horrible examples of racist people with CERTAIN presidents administrations but we can also find a lot of good In others. The world isn’t perfect, politicians aren’t perfect, but we are a changing dynamic society .

Calling all Crones, ladies who support Crones, ladies supported by Crones, and ladies who will one day be Crones! ⁣⁣
...So…⁣⁣
Calling all women! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The third and final day of #MWF_2019 will celebrate the Crone archetype of older, wise-women with the help of crone, sagewoman, and artist, Katie Flowers. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Katie’s session, Sagewomen - De-scaring the Crone Archetype through Art, will celebrate your journey and life of stories. This workshop is a place to discuss, consider, and make art featuring your life experiences and all of their beautiful, unsettling, liberating, and curious facets. Utilising the stories attained through years of experience, each attendee will craft a set of 2-D Russian Nesting Matryoshka dolls which stack to represent her whole self. Attendees will paint each segment to illustrate each stage of life, and the richness of experiences within. Katie will help us to explore and take pride in our myriad of past roles, and gloriously manifest our wise present-day self.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Women of any age who respect and honor the Crone archetype will find beauty in this art workshop, so please connect to the ancient female energy stirring within you and join us!⁣⁣

Sedaj vem, da temu ni tako. Gre za stanje umirjenosti in sprejemanja življenja takšnega kakršen je. To ne pomeni, da se od te stopnje dalje dogajajo le še lepa, magična in pozitivna dogajanja. Gre za doživljanje kot tako, kjer težke občutke lahkotno prefiltriramo skozi telo oz. svoje bitje, se ob tem ne groze pretresemo, ampak vibriramo v vsej svoji energiji, ki jo kot izvor ljubezni premoremo in vedno znova rojevamo.

It’s somewhat a pain in the arse, given that the advisory lifestyle changes include avoiding wine and potatoes (two of my most stable food groups), but a real relief that I finally have an answer to my questions. Earlier this year, I started noticing some changes. I was putting on weight for no apparent reason, I had severe bloating that nothing would shift, my skin was oily and I was breaking out constantly. I’ve always been quite a hairy person, but the level of thick dark hairs on my body started to creep up and then, finally, my periods decided they had better things to do than pay me regular visits.

The Divine feminine is not a distant God in Heaven, but a presence that is here with us, needing our response. In response to humanity’s patriarchal imbalance, her song has been cast into the shadows of our consciousness for a long, long time…

We have forgotten her just as we have forgotten so much of what is sacred…

In the denial of the feminine, her sacred power and wisdom, we have impoverished life in ways we do not understand. ~ Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee

But she is alive, she is here now, her Presence is rebirthing…

Emerging…Back into the light of our consciousness…

She comes bearing gifts…As a blesser of humanity and the Earth itself.

She bridges the unreal divide between spirit and matter.

And when her Light is awakened, she will bring the world back into harmony and balance. ~ Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee

She is centered in the sacredness of life, and the interconnectedness of it all.

She nurtures in silence, loves with such a love that the world is changed through her softly, in a way that seems invisible, yet shakes life in the world to its very core.

She is an ocean of transformative power…

She carries the divine Essence in every cell of her body, in the very substance of herself.

Her instinctual knowledge of our oneness with all of life, and her attunement to the mysteries of life, are qualities so very needed at this time.",yesallwomen,"|#empowerment #inspiration #selflove #empoweringwomen #womenempowerment #women #positivevibes #healing  #feminism #loveyourself #girlpower #feminist #fitness

443,144,"Are you getting what you need? 🚨 ⁣
⁣
(Ok so ignore the comedically placed dog for a sec...😅) Maslow said there’s a hierarchy of human needs: physiological comfort > safety > belonging > esteem > self-actualisation. Picture it like a pyramid with self-actualisation at the very top. 🌄 And obv – because I’m telling you about it – knowing this can help you write really stellar copy, that attracts clients and turns them into customers 🌟 ⁣
⁣
Good conversion copy should hit on some, if not all, of these basic human needs 🌈 Are you selling something that can offer community? (Belonging) Will your service emotionally impact your customer? (Esteem) Can you prove that you’re trustworthy by using testimonials? (Safety) Once you know what makes people tick, it’s pretty easy to write copy that’s guaranteed to get you the results you want 🔱 I love science, you guys 🤓 ⁣
⁣
And coming back to the dog between the legs: I like to think it shows my needs getting pretty damn met 😏 My lil cone-headed dog is part of my family (belonging – right between the legs 😂), he licks my face non-stop (esteem) 🐕 And I’m doing a job I love that means I get to pose in my garden all the time (self-actualisation) with the sun shining (comfort). ☀️😉",yesallwomen,|#empowerher #femaleentrepreneurs #coachinglifestyle #ladieswholaunch #millennialcoach #trusttheuniverse #goaldiggers #girlgang #fempreneur #freelancefeels #personalgrowth #workfromwherever #lightisthenewblack #hustleandheart #selfconfidence #yesallwomen #youbelong #femalefounders #goaldigger #bosslady #confidentwomen #solopreneur #bossbabe #hersuccess #sheinspiresme #risesisterrise #personalgrowth #communityovercompetition #dailyinspirationalquotes #womehelpingwomen|Love the human needs pyramid idea.

445,146,"This book was SO GOOD. Holy shit. I’m still putting my thoughts together for a proper review, but I would definitely recommend it. So many stories of women trying to navigate this fucked up world. It ranges from inappropriate staring from strangers to violent assaults, stories of women and girls trying to just exist safely in public and private spaces, the reactions that follow when they share their stories, and so much more. Some of the comics are messy and hard to follow, while some have such beautiful art that any single panel might be suitable for framing. All of it is powerful in its own way. Really good stuff. I feel certain there is more than once piece in here that every woman could relate to.

Do you read comics or graphic novels at all? I don’t read many of them because I’m so picky, but most of the ones I have read have been really good. ⚠️ Disclaimer: I received this book for free from @abramsbooks in a Goodreads giveaway. ⚠️",yesallwomen,|#metoo #metoomovement #metoo❤️ #metooo #metoomvmt #metoocampaign #bookreview #bookreviewer #bookreviewers #bookreviewersofinstagram #yesallwomen #feminist #feministaf #feministart #feministartists #feministcomics #goodreadsgiveaway #goodreads #triggerwarning #comicsanthology|Not a fan of comics or graphic novels.,14

So many other issues in the world|This is called “reaching”|It’s based off of a book....|We can ""talk"" about racial injustice and all that as much as we want but a smart man once told me that ""You cant reason someone out of a position they didnt reason themselves into in the first place"" and it's the same here. Pop culture can touch on social issues as much as we want but its shitty parents that make racists and bigots. Start with the kids and we wouldnt have this problem in the first place|They should!.. unless it makes people uncomfortable to watch. I hope that doesn’t matter more than the experience of those who live it 24/7..🤔 crazy concept eh? Anyways.. thanks for all your intersectional posts👌🏾💕👏🏾|hey, fembot! im a big fan of your instagram page, but i also just have a genuine conversation: what are your thoughts on shows like euphoria and trw, and how the media in general treats mental illness? (this isnt meant to derail the posts and its meaning, im just curious! 🤠)|Idk this show but in general I feel like they should represent real life. Maybe there are no pocs cuz some ppl really dont have them as friends the same way some pocs dont have white friends. I think we should look at television as something that isnt real as trying to capture some real life... but as fiction. So we should view it as an attack. Just that this isnt one of those instances. Because I hate seeing shows/movies were their poc characters are there solely for the sake of not being called a racist show/movie. They need to really fit in and just be people! People who happen to be whatever race or color they are, instead of always making them stereotypical to whatever race they are. Idk I hope that made sense.|@laurenbuys|It’s a TV show based on a fictional book. It is for entertainment value. If I want to read about injustices whether with race, gender, sexuality, etc I’ll turn on a documentary or read something nonfiction. Also if a tv show is offensive there is this really great invention called a remote and anyone of us can pick it up and just change the channel. 💜|This show is amazing ... I’m not a rich house wife nor a highly paid professional wife ... but this show is relatable on so many levels! Divorce, infidelity, abuse, bullying, rape, and trauma ... I think this show doesn’t need any adjustment ... it sends all the messages just as they need to be sent ... my opinion ... ps I love this show|This is nonsense.. This is like complaining about Gossip Girl being about privileged people or complaining about TWD being about zombies. There's a diversity of shows that talk about racial and gender injustices. Why do you specifically pick this one?|instead of reading a headline and commenting based off of that maybe it would be useful to read the article. being considerate or race (specifically of bonnie and skye) would make sense for the series and only broaden appeal. rn bonnies character is far less developed than the others, which is problematic because it seems like the writers just left out the black person. also it underutilizes zoë kravitz, who is incredibly talented|No! Why should we draw attention to the fact that there even are racial inequities! I mean, not in the way that we should ignore the injustices but we should stop perpetuating racism. The more we draw attention to it the more that it becomes true. The show is trying to steer in the direction of racial equality which is exactly what we all should. It won’t start today but it starts somewhere.|This is a show about a bunch of suburban white moms from what I can tell. Doesn’t seem like they’d even do a good job with those circumstances of bringing these issues to light. They have one biracial girl and one black girl, right? I don’t think in this setting they’d be able to do much other than pidgeonhole the entire issue into mush. This whole thing reminds me of how in IT Chapter One they took away being the historian from Mikey and just gave him the gun. Except nobody talked about that one.|No it’s fictional entertainment ffs|@1stvishnay I felt I should tag you|No. It's just a show and it's fictional. Not all shows have be covering the topic of racial injustice.|Tv only displays the bourgeoisie|🤡🌍 clooooooown woooooooorld|what the fuck is this lmao|*autism intensifies*|Lol ive never even heard of that shit but it sounds and looks liiiiiiiiike iiiiiiit",1508

I wish I'd had this clarity of thought when I was in my phase. Congratulations on your wisdom. 💕|I'm guilty of this as well|But that is what makes us all unique|But that is what makes us all unique|our thoughts|Guys think the same thing. “I’m not like other guys” because they feel other emotions besides anger and shallow regard for sex. Think about it.|This.. is so sad.. actually|Wow 😳🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻|I’ve recently come to the discovery that I actually really like the color pink. All my life I have hated pink because it was deemed feminine|Its sad. But the male stereotype is just as bad as the female steretype. Conclusion: stereotypes are bad, girls guys and everyone who doesn’t fit either categories are the real loving deals🤘🏻🤲🏻👐🏿. Stop overthinking stereotypes created by evil  and jealous minds, its not worth ur sexy brain’s time ♥️🧠.|Usually when I hear I’m not like other girls that means she’s about to do some freaky shit🤤🤤|You are exactly like the other girls tho|This is called deflecting responsibility. If you believe this, could it be because you, yourself are biased. Otherwise if “men” are perpetuating this myth, then we too could blame someone else.|my ""im not like other girls"" phase turned into ""im not a girl"" lmao|But yet their intrests are copy paste|Fucking hell!|🙌🙌🙌|Love this 🖤|Fuuuuuuuuck please stop using the #whyamilikethis you've completely misunderstood it's meaning and seeing all this fem shit on my wall has my friends looking at me sideways|@fembotmag can you please block me so I don't have to see your retarded posts on the hashtag #whyamilikethis that I follow?|You are special just like everyone else|Wait - are you saying we aren’t all unique?|But that also begs the question why do women scorn other women for liking make up and other popular things? Yes society may have these stereo typical roles of girls only like make up and want to get their nails done but women who actually do like these popular things shouldn’t be scrutinized for their genuine interests. Why not support one another’s interests despite the stereotypes that surround them rather than give those stereotypes power over us.|Everyone’s forgetting that if nobody gave a fuck about any of this.

 Monique and I speak about the mindset she needed to overcome poverty and struggle in her life and the journey that lead to becoming a mental health advocate and authoring 6 books! Monique speaks openly about how mentorship and seeking guidance transformed her life and helped her to pivot from Economics to ultimately finding her true passion.

481,182,"This October 4th will be the fourth year that red dresses have hung from the trees in Centennial Park in remembrance of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Trans and Two-Spirits. The REDdress Project which is now a nation-wide expression of grief, outrage and loss, was created in 2014 by Jaime Black, a Metis multi-disciplinary artist. As poignant as it is powerful, Black’s installation art project: red dresses and garments hung in wild and public spaces, has become a national action to evoke the memory and honour the humanity of our stolen sisters. 
The REDdress project is a simple but profound way to honour the humanity and the memory of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Trans and Two Spirits. 
This year take a moment on October 4th to witness these silent representations of lives lost to violence in the intersection of colonialism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and classism. People are invited to bring red dresses or garments to hang in Centennial Park between 8am and 9am on Friday October 4th, or to hang a dress in their driveways or work place. The dresses will be up all day. There will be a vigil at 4:30pm in Centennial Park to honour our stolen sisters.",yesallwomen,|#saltspring #saltspringisland #bc #britishcolumbia #evabc #metoo #gulfislands #genderedviolence #solidarity #timesup #believesurvivors #womensreality #everydaysexism k#heforshe #yesallwomen #endviolence #endsexualviolence y#endviolenceagainstwomen #right2housing|#missingandmurderedindigenouswomen #mmiwg #mmiwgt2s #reddressproject,57

Manipulating a girl/woman, or any person for that matter, into having sex with you is not only disrespectful, dishonourable, it is heresy of the highest degree against the sacred feminine, of all women, of the primordial Goddess that is a part of every living thing, including you.⁣
⁣
By the way, if a person ""forces"" anyone into non-consensual sex, as in, against the other persons will, that is called RAPE. Anything between that and touching another person in a manner that makes them feel violated is SEXUAL ASSAULT. ⁣
⁣
Against popular misogynistic belief, women do not enjoy being raped: no one does.⁣
⁣
There are conscious ways of approaching women and engaging in romantic relations with them, ways that are honouring of women and beautiful. That is the way forward.⁣

At 16 years old a child is underage, a minor, just learning to drive a car, starting/in their junior year of high school. At 16 a child does not need to learn what harassment, assault, physical, psychological, or verbal abuse is. They do not need to be terrified, followed, commented on, touched, etc. Keep your hands, eyes, and unwarranted and unwanted comments away from everyone. Whether they are a child, a woman, a man, non-binary, transgender, gender fluid, fat, thin, tall, short, black, Asian, Indian, intelligent, uneducated, rich, poor, I DON’T CARE. There is no identity factory that warrants harassment of that person. Whether a person is wearing a winter coat and snow pants or the shortest shorts and a bra or shorts and no shirt, there is no physical factor that warrants harassment of that person. STAY AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT YOUR ATTENTION.

It’s horrifying that anywhere in this world we have to tell people to stay away from children especially. There is no excuse to assault, harm, or traumatize anyone, but to the innocence of a child, there is no comparison. There is absolutely no situation in which a person should even be remotely confused over the consent of another person if they are underage. A minor CANNOT under any circumstances, consent to sexual acts with someone over the age of 18. Targeting a 16-year-old and following her to the point of terror and fear is unacceptable in this country or any other. We are human beings with an obligation to each other to bring good into this world and remove the hate that is catcalling, harassment, assault, etc. #STOPstreetHARASSMENT

497,198,"“I draw a line down the middle of a chalkboard, sketching a male symbol on one side and a female symbol on the other. Then I ask just the men: What steps do you guys take, on a daily basis, to prevent yourselves from being sexually assaulted? At first there is a kind of awkward silence as the men try to figure out if they've been asked a trick question. The silence gives way to a smattering of nervous laughter. Occasionally, a young a guy will raise his hand and say, 'I stay out of prison.' This is typically followed by another moment of laughter, before someone finally raises his hand and soberly states, 'Nothing. I don't think about it.' Then I ask women the same question. What steps do you take on a daily basis to prevent yourselves from being sexually assaulted? Women throughout the audience immediately start raising their hands. As the men sit in stunned silence, the women recount safety precautions they take as part of their daily routine. Here are some of their answers: Hold my keys as a potential weapon. Look in the back seat of the car before getting in. Carry a cell phone. Don't go jogging at night. Lock all the windows when I sleep, even on hot summer nights. Be careful not to drink too much. Don't put my drink down and come back to it; make sure I see it being poured. Own a big dog. Carry Mace or pepper spray. Have an unlisted phone number. Have a man's voice on my answering machine. Park in well-lit areas. Don't use parking garages. Don't get on elevators with only one man, or with a group of men. Vary my route home from work. Watch what I wear. Don't use highway rest areas. Use a home alarm system. Don't wear headphones when jogging. Avoid forests or wooded areas, even in the daytime. Don't take a first-floor apartment. Go out in groups. Own a firearm. Meet men on first dates in public places. Make sure to have a car or cab fare. Don't make eye contact with men on the street. Make assertive eye contact with men on the street.” -Jackson Katz⁣

498,199,"Often I will witness women view each other as competition, whereas men just see each other as colleagues. Is this because we already have to fight our way through so much that when another female comes in and shakes things up, we view them as a threat? Or are we just trained to fight, that we don’t notice ourselves discrediting other women? 🤷🏽‍♀️Is this even a thing or am I just imagining things?

In this fight to close the #gendergap and #equalpayforwomen, it is more important now than ever before for women to empower and support each other. Yes, it is still an issue. (Recently watched a movie, #latenight with @mindykaling and couldn’t help but bring this up.) What do y’all think?

📢📢📢 SELF-CARE ISN'T SELFISH 📣📣📣📣

I'm always taking care of everyone else. I can't help it 🤷🏻‍♀️ If I know someone has a problem and I can do something about it, I do it. And it feels good to help, and I'm happy to do it, don't get me wrong. But most of the time I forget to make time for myself.
.
.
Travelling full time, takin care of a child with autism, homeschooling, and running my own business is A LOT of work. 🤯
.
.
I feel like it would be selfish to stop and do something I like 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ but I'm working on it!

So now, when I find myself working until 2am, I take the next day off. I stay in bed eating candy and watching Disney movies. I write something nice about me and I let my little one hug me all day long 💚

A woman is a woman,
Can't we be smart individually,
Can't we all be strong individually,
Can't we all be proud individually,
Why do you have to say i am acting like a man,
Can't I be as aggressive as aggressive is,

Why is man the tape measure of power,
Why is man the tape measure of intelligence,
Who made man the mark I should work to be,

_
If you missed my earlier post, @joelsnorton and I have created our own 8 week challenge. This consists of meditating twice a day, gym at least 4 times a week, and meal prep every Sunday. 
_
Putting yourself on an 8 week challenge can be daunting particularly when you’re traveling (I am in Auckland next week), or have a high work load (I feel you - 45 hour working weeks + working on my side hustle).
_
The point of our challenge is to reset our mind and introduce healthy habits into our lives. These healthy habits all lead to higher levels of endorphins and improved productivity. If we miss a day, we aren’t angry, we simply do better the next day.

We would love you to join us! If you want to come on this journey with us, tag me in your meditation, exercise and/or meal prepping posts.

Boys are punished far more often than girls at home and in school for the kind of behavior that sets them apart from girls. Not only that, but it's literally been scientifically proven that girls mature socially much faster than boys. Fuck off.|True but this isn't the case all the time|This stems from girls being forced to be more mature from an early age to be married by 14 and have children|Yes but girls still do mature earlier even if they were both disciplined the same|Well yes, but our brain also mature faster then boys scientifically|Wow|So true specially in Middle East 🤦🏻‍♀️💔|Gay|@mxntsedg|@angelitos7 @mariexbel|@_alyyjayy giiirrrrrlllll.....🙌🏽|Boys are punished for things that girls get away with... Goes both ways. Why does this one-sided page keep popping up in my feed?|Incorrect|This is stupid|Very fucking real. THINK ABOUT IT.|As much as I am a feminist, and do believe in equality amongst all it is scientifically proven that girls in fact do mature faster. A girl has the same maturity to a guy who’s 6 years older. However I do agree that society has unfortunately given men a free pass for that very reason which is why we are treated unfairly.|This has never happened to me once,being well behaved and having manners has always been something both girls and boys had to respect|No|🙄|bruh|Read a book|@jemimaleewilliams|Incorrect. Boys are always behave stupid like they don't know what maturity is. Girls are more matured by birth.|@cpawlik 😳🙌🏻|Unfortunately society is changing and not even girls have manners any more|@kristencures|😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Comedic gold!|💯|Motherfucking hand is going up as we speak. These mofos get away with everything.|Boys are punished in school since primary for not acting like girls. The ideal behaviour in schools is the female behaviour. Anything else is wrong and is punished, so boys cant be boys. LOUDER FOR THOSE AT THE FRONT|Pretty much every teacher thinks girls are more well behaved without any basis. Boys are often seen as troublemakers even though girls are chatting just as loud, or bullying other girls harder. Talk about that. It's harmful and a much more real issue|no, science literally depicts that women’s brains mature faster|They literally go into puberty earlier loll|No because science|It was true for me.|But girls can cry openly, share their emotions, all without being considered less than a woman|No you're wrong. They mature faster because science|Because they ain't built for that behavior|Ya, no|....no, females just mature faster|What.... but scientifically women do mature faster... it’s an actual thing.|I would love a girl who acts like me|🎈|This is retarded|@the_indian_feminist|I just want you to know this is the stupidest thing I’ve seen all day.|boys are beaten, spanked, and molested at least twice as mucg as girls.... #matureaudience|😂|This is such a fucking bullshit that I'm calling you out on it.|Nah fam we actually just mature emotionally faster. It’s how we work.|The MOST BULLSHIT POST TODAY|@pob1693|👏|Welp|Actually.. Statistically speaking, boys get more abused and ""disciplined"" than girls.. So..|Maturity isnt a good thing anways, as it usually leads to poor mental health.  plus not every parent or authority figure punishes girls for doing things guys are allowed to do. Also, saying louder for the people in the back doesn't make your opinion any more valid.|One thing I heard TOO OFTEN as a kid by my parents: “it’s different because he’s a boy”....|No, girls actually do mature faster than boys.|😭|yaaaa sexual thoughts aren’t allowed for girls when they’re young but guys are more masculine when they have them & they’re young|mhm, like what exactly?|Fucking cry me a river🖕|That is a brilliant statement|That is a brilliant statement|Re-TWEET 🗣🗣🗣🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼|Yes but also literally girls mature fastrr|Hallelujah|Ur mom|Meanwhile boys get put on meds in elementary school and get treated like defective girls|but they ACTUALLY mature faster|Yeah I call bullshit.|Why do i get this shit in my feed|👏👏|👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼|Y’all just want some attention|@kasee_free|🙋‍♀️🏻|@bomber_becca|That’s not true.

She is not in some distant future or in the heads of all that have always thought they know best what is best for you and who you should be. ⁣
The perfect woman is YOU, just the way you are. ⁣
You, with all your mood swings, all your doubts and fears and all the challenges you are being faced with.⁣
It is YOU, if only you allow yourself to reclaim your BIRTHRIGHT. Your SPACE.⁣
It is YOU, when you take a hold of your own SCEPTER and become the RULER of your own personal DESTINY.⁣
Step out of the false ideas that you've taken upon as your own.⁣
ALLOW yourself to dive into the true resonance with your body and soul, learn to listen to what it has to say. Learn to lovingly but firmly hold your ground and walk the path that is yours and yours alone.⁣

559,260,Acne prone humans HELLO AGAIN i have a fun thing 4 you. Coffee grounds on your face as a mask that turns into an exfoliating experience (if you want). The caffeine is good for the acne. The coffee oil is soothing. Pls try. All skin is different so maybe yours will hate this but my wild skin seems to like. The only downside is being slightly orange after. But that’s nothing a little makeup can’t hide. 😇 **update** the lovely @lovettejallow informed me that vigorous scrubbing with coffee grounds can cause micro tears so BE GENTLE. This is good advice in general: be gentle with yourself!,yesallwomen,"|I use to use coffee grounds for my face until I had an esthetician’s meeting and was told the edges of the coffee were too jagged and caused micro tears. I then had a dermatologist do a skin screening and bam there it was proven black on white thatvi had micro tears caused by the coffee grounds. Now I use Paulas choice non physical exfoliator and it works much better for me.

_
The last 6 months I have been so focused on my career, FIIT Collective and #thefemalesintechshow . Whilst I have loved every minute, I’ve also had to make sacrifices to ensure we met our target deadlines.
_
I’ve accomplished so much during that time, and I don’t regret a thing, but frankly I am exhausted, and I need to re-balance. It’s time for a new season of my life, to shower myself with self-care practices, and revisit my work life balance. (Check out my podcast on work life balance at www.fiitcollective.com/4 If you haven’t already).
_
@joelsnorton and I decided to put ourselves on an 8 week challenge, and we would LOVE you to join us. 
_
Here’s our 8 week challenge: 
_
1. Meditating twice a day
_
2. Going to the gym at least 4 times a week. 
_
3. Meal prepping every Sunday

A Virtual Assistant is someone who works remotely, providing different services to support other businesses. 
There’re many things a virtual assistant can do: it all depends on her background, but if it can be done remotely, then you’ll find a VA providing that service. 
Virtual assistants have been in high demand for a while now, as we save valuable time to business owners, so they can focus on what they do better, or spend more time with their friends and family.

572,273,"Day Five of #StrongArmAsanas2 challenge: EPK Prep (within flow). As you might have guessed from yesterday, I can't arm balance (yet) so I am doing simple prep poses when the actual pose is not part of my practice. EPK is well outside my practice, so I did a little prep for it instead, and practiced coming up on my toe and taking the weight in my arms; I still need to work on straightening my back leg, but that will come. I did this as part of a small flow this evening, as I needed a bit of self-care after a nasty incident at a shopping centre today.

I am currently redecorating my room into a small 'sanctuary space' and I needed to head out to the shops for fairy lights. As I left the store, I was herded (I don't know how else to describe it) into a corner by a man, who groped me and tried to take my handbag. I screamed and lashed out, while he scarpered and I got told off by a security guard for 'making a scene'. I told him I'd been groped and he shrugged it off with 'These things are best handled calmly'. TO HELL WITH THAT!!! Once I got home and got busy I felt better, but every time I paused I felt angry and sick again. I made some time for yoga this evening because I just needed to move, to reclaim my space, to challenge my mind in a safe, positive way. My body is mine, it belongs only to me, and yoga helps me remember that, while also quietening my mind. It was the self-care I needed before I tried to sleep. #metoo #yesallwomen #selfcare 💪Hosts:

590,291,"😉The only shame that you should have in masturbation is the shame of not doing it, right @luvguru4u? ⁠
⁠
Imagine if your clitoris was a car, and as you know, cars only have 1 purpose and that is to drive them.⁠
⁠
But what if you never wanted to drive your car because you have fears of getting into an accident, or deep buried belief systems that only ""bad people"" drive cars (like only bad girls masturbate)?⁠
⁠
Why would you have a car then?⁠
⁠
Wouldn't you be doing it a disservice by not driving it based on your fears and beliefs systems?⁠
⁠
Your clitoris is no different. You were born with one, and it has one purpose, and that purpose is pleasure.⁠
⁠
But you don't choose to pursue pleasure because of fears and limiting belief systems, so therefore you have a clitoris but aren't doing anything with it, just like having a car but not driving it.⁠
⁠
Show your body some pleasure... that's what it was designed for!⁠
⁠
You were not given a body to only experience pain, judgments, fears, shame, regret, guilt, etc.⁠

592,293,"Title: Beat the Puss y Up.

Hyper aware of the derogatory language our culture accepts without blinking an eye, this piece is exploring gender bias and sexism in language. “Beat the Pussy Up” is a commonly used phrase in rap lyrics and people are singing it without considering the repercussions of their words. To me, the phrase is literally referring to raping a woman, but according to www.urbandictionary.com, the verb means to f*** the pussy and is “commonly used in street talk and hip-hop culture”. This language perpetuates the idea that women are sex objects for men to conquest. The reproductive organs also loosely resemble a bull skull as a symbol of women’s strength and resilience. The painting is an anatomical view of a woman’s genitals and I chose to accentuate the fabric’s qualities by tearing and fraying the edges, which also serve as a comparison to “Beating the Pussy Up”. .

I’m supposed to drop some profound entrepreneurial wisdom. 
I’m supposed to make you want to “shine bright” today, but I don’t wanna. 
Not today. 
Sometimes I’m literally dying to get the vibrancy through my screen to yours. 
Some days I can’t hold my tongue (or typing thumbs) for anything. 
Somedays I’m so lit up I can’t stop myself from shining, smiling, dancing and living loudly. 
But then other days...I just don’t want to. 
I want to feel an emotion other than the high we all claim to only experience. 
I want it to be ok that I’m a grumpy mom who’s not required to turn it off because I’m blessed to have children. 
I want to be the woman who was let down. I have expectations, or standards and they weren’t met, and it sucks, and I don’t want to apologize them off and say “we’ll at least this....” NO. I want to say “you suck, don’t do that again, and I’m mad for a bit.”....or something. 
Ya know, I just want to feel how I feel without trying to curve it or swallow it. 
I don’t want to end my sentence with “but I’m so grateful” because I want you to know it’s ok to have a shite day. It’s ok to have a shite day! You’re not a bummer, you’re not lacking the proper skills, you’re not a bad mom, friend, wife of human because you don’t feel like showing up for anyone today.

596,297,"Give Your Child the Tools to Recognize Sexual Abuse. 💪⁣
⁣
Talk to kids about their bodies and empower them to speak out.⁣⁣
Teach children that their feelings matter and that they deserve respect.  When a child shares a feeling, we validate it.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Emphasize that children’s bodies belong to them. Kids need to understand that no one is allowed to touch their private parts, look at their private parts or talk to them about their private parts outside of appropriate settings, such as a doctor’s office. Communicate this concept to your kids as early as 2 years old.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Share your own stories, and include as many feelings and sensations as you can. Children look to adults who are close to them to figure out the meaning of what they are experiencing, so it’s helpful to share our own experiences.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Empower kids to say “no” and talk openly. Encouraging emotional honesty and physical boundaries helps kids gain some control over their bodies. Letting a child say, “No, I don’t want a hug, but a handshake is O.K.” ⁣⁣

Can't we be different entities,
A man is a man,
A woman is a woman,
Can't we be smart individually,
Can't we all be strong individually,
Can't we all be proud individually,
Why do you have to say i am acting like a man,
Can't I be as aggressive as aggressive is,
Why is man the tape measure of strength,
Why is man the tape measure of power,
Why is man the tape measure of intelligence,
Who made man the mark I should work to be,

_
If you missed my earlier post, @joelsnorton and I have created our own 8 week challenge. This consists of meditating twice a day, gym at least 4 times a week, and meal prep every Sunday. 
_
Putting yourself on an 8 week challenge can be daunting particularly when you’re traveling (I am in Auckland next week), or have a high work load (I feel you - 45 hour working weeks + working on my side hustle).
_
The point of our challenge is to reset our mind and introduce healthy habits into our lives. These healthy habits all lead to higher levels of endorphins and improved productivity. If we miss a day, we aren’t angry, we simply do better the next day. 
_
We would love you to join us! If you want to come on this journey with us, tag me in your meditation, exercise and/or meal prepping posts.

_
The last 6 months I have been so focused on my career, FIIT Collective and #thefemalesintechshow . Whilst I have loved every minute, I’ve also had to make sacrifices to ensure we met our target deadlines.
_
I’ve accomplished so much during that time, and I don’t regret a thing, but frankly I am exhausted, and I need to re-balance. It’s time for a new season of my life, to shower myself with self-care practices, and revisit my work life balance. (Check out my podcast on work life balance at www.fiitcollective.com/4 If you haven’t already).
_
@joelsnorton and I decided to put ourselves on an 8 week challenge, and we would LOVE you to join us.

Here’s our 8 week challenge: 
_
1. Meditating twice a day

2. Going to the gym at least 4 times a week.

A Virtual Assistant is someone who works remotely, providing different services to support other businesses. 
There’re many things a virtual assistant can do: it all depends on her background, but if it can be done remotely, then you’ll find a VA providing that service. 
Virtual assistants have been in high demand for a while now, as we save valuable time to business owners, so they can focus on what they do better, or spend more time with their friends and family.

663,65,"Sorority was born to serve a greater purpose. We provide support to NGOs, start-ups and small businesses that help woman, queer and trans people, by taking care of administrative tasks, translation, communication strategy and social media presence.

Why?

Because intersectional feminism is something we strongly believe in. Life might not be fair, but we can change that. Your cause is also mine. .
.
.
.
Sorority nació para servir a un propósito mayor. Proveemos soporte a ONGs y pequeños negocios que promuevan la inclusión y ayuden a mujeres y disidencias, ocupándonos de tareas administrativas, traducciones, estrategias de comunicación y presencia en redes sociales.

670,72,"Day Five of #StrongArmAsanas2 challenge: EPK Prep (within flow). As you might have guessed from yesterday, I can't arm balance (yet) so I am doing simple prep poses when the actual pose is not part of my practice. EPK is well outside my practice, so I did a little prep for it instead, and practiced coming up on my toe and taking the weight in my arms; I still need to work on straightening my back leg, but that will come. I did this as part of a small flow this evening, as I needed a bit of self-care after a nasty incident at a shopping centre today.

I am currently redecorating my room into a small 'sanctuary space' and I needed to head out to the shops for fairy lights. As I left the store, I was herded (I don't know how else to describe it) into a corner by a man, who groped me and tried to take my handbag. I screamed and lashed out, while he scarpered and I got told off by a security guard for 'making a scene'. I told him I'd been groped and he shrugged it off with 'These things are best handled calmly'. TO HELL WITH THAT!!! Once I got home and got busy I felt better, but every time I paused I felt angry and sick again. I made some time for yoga this evening because I just needed to move, to reclaim my space, to challenge my mind in a safe, positive way. My body is mine, it belongs only to me, and yoga helps me remember that, while also quietening my mind. It was the self-care I needed before I tried to sleep. #metoo #yesallwomen #selfcare 💪Hosts:

Shame and sex simply should not go together, yet they often do.⁠

688,90,"😉The only shame that you should have in masturbation is the shame of not doing it, right @luvguru4u? ⁠
⁠
Imagine if your clitoris was a car, and as you know, cars only have 1 purpose and that is to drive them.⁠
⁠
But what if you never wanted to drive your car because you have fears of getting into an accident, or deep buried belief systems that only ""bad people"" drive cars (like only bad girls masturbate)?⁠
⁠
Why would you have a car then?⁠
⁠
Wouldn't you be doing it a disservice by not driving it based on your fears and beliefs systems?⁠
⁠
Your clitoris is no different. You were born with one, and it has one purpose, and that purpose is pleasure.⁠
⁠
But you don't choose to pursue pleasure because of fears and limiting belief systems, so therefore you have a clitoris but aren't doing anything with it, just like having a car but not driving it.⁠
⁠
Show your body some pleasure... that's what it was designed for!⁠
⁠
You were not given a body to only experience pain, judgments, fears, shame, regret, guilt, etc.⁠

690,92,"Title: Beat the Puss y Up.

Hyper aware of the derogatory language our culture accepts without blinking an eye, this piece is exploring gender bias and sexism in language. “Beat the Pussy Up” is a commonly used phrase in rap lyrics and people are singing it without considering the repercussions of their words. To me, the phrase is literally referring to raping a woman, but according to www.urbandictionary.com, the verb means to f*** the pussy and is “commonly used in street talk and hip-hop culture”. This language perpetuates the idea that women are sex objects for men to conquest. The reproductive organs also loosely resemble a bull skull as a symbol of women’s strength and resilience. The painting is an anatomical view of a woman’s genitals and I chose to accentuate the fabric’s qualities by tearing and fraying the edges, which also serve as a comparison to “Beating the Pussy Up”. .

691,93,"I’m supposed to smile. 
I’m supposed to drop some profound entrepreneurial wisdom. 
I’m supposed to make you want to “shine bright” today, but I don’t wanna. 
Not today. 
Sometimes I’m literally dying to get the vibrancy through my screen to yours. 
Some days I can’t hold my tongue (or typing thumbs) for anything. 
Somedays I’m so lit up I can’t stop myself from shining, smiling, dancing and living loudly. 
But then other days...I just don’t want to. 
I want to feel an emotion other than the high we all claim to only experience. 
I want it to be ok that I’m a grumpy mom who’s not required to turn it off because I’m blessed to have children. 
I want to be the woman who was let down. I have expectations, or standards and they weren’t met, and it sucks, and I don’t want to apologize them off and say “we’ll at least this....” NO. I want to say “you suck, don’t do that again, and I’m mad for a bit.”....or something. 
Ya know, I just want to feel how I feel without trying to curve it or swallow it. 
I don’t want to end my sentence with “but I’m so grateful” because I want you to know it’s ok to have a shite day. It’s ok to have a shite day! You’re not a bummer, you’re not lacking the proper skills, you’re not a bad mom, friend, wife of human because you don’t feel like showing up for anyone today. 
It’s all good sis, do you. 🔥💋",yesallwomen,"|.

694,96,"Give Your Child the Tools to Recognize Sexual Abuse. 💪⁣
⁣
Talk to kids about their bodies and empower them to speak out.⁣⁣
Teach children that their feelings matter and that they deserve respect.  When a child shares a feeling, we validate it.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Emphasize that children’s bodies belong to them. Kids need to understand that no one is allowed to touch their private parts, look at their private parts or talk to them about their private parts outside of appropriate settings, such as a doctor’s office. Communicate this concept to your kids as early as 2 years old.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Share your own stories, and include as many feelings and sensations as you can. Children look to adults who are close to them to figure out the meaning of what they are experiencing, so it’s helpful to share our own experiences.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Empower kids to say “no” and talk openly. Encouraging emotional honesty and physical boundaries helps kids gain some control over their bodies. Letting a child say, “No, I don’t want a hug, but a handshake is O.K.” ⁣⁣

696,98,"Never apologize for anything ever again in your life because you're a woman and you get a free pass!...is 𝘯𝘰𝘵 what this shirt is about. On the contrary, I think it's super important for everyone to be held accountable for their actions, apologize and do better next time. No one is entitled to be a rude mofo just because they don't understand or don't care.⁣
⁣
Never apologizing for 𝘣𝘦𝘪𝘯𝘨 a woman, though, is entirely different. When I say living unapologetically as a woman–trans, cis, queer, ALL types of women–I'm talking about 𝘯𝘰𝘵 making space for others to feel more comfortable about your womanliness. Don't apologize for your period. Don't say sorry for speaking up at work or in school. Don't feel bad for not having kids, not wearing makeup, not wearing a bra, having an abortion, not taking your husband's last name, not having a husband, not shaving your legs. Don't say sorry to your partner if you don't want sex with them right now. Don't make emotional space for someone else at the expense of your own emotional needs and comfort. Share your thoughts, feelings, opinions, desires, anger, frustration, ideas, pain, if that's what you need. Don't apologize for pointing out issues or providing solutions or instructions. Don't be afraid to call people out or rock the status quo. ⁣
⁣
And the opposite is true, too! Wear as much makeup as you want. Wear whatever clothes you want. Have as much sex as you want. Eat whatever you want. Be a stay-at-home mom if you want, or run a business, or both! ⁣
⁣
I don't want this to be a post about telling women what to do and what not to do–there's already enough of that in this world. All I'm saying is, so much of what is associated with femininity or womanliness is seen as trivial, gross, second best, or is controlled, and that needs to stop. Don't ever feel that being a woman in any sort of capacity is ever too much or not enough. It's always just right ♡⁣

705,107,"I want to always use my plaform to spread light. Sometimes that means having hard conversations like this one.

Since moving to Asunción in March, I have completely had to go online with my business. All of my clients live in the states, and all of the networking I do is online. I love meeting and connecting with new faces! I've used Instagram for that and have made some really meaningful relationships through connecting on here.

Today I got a message from a man introducing himself and asking where I'm from. I honestly haven't gotten very many appropriate and work related messages from men in the history of me working online, I block and report innaproproate messages I get from men on a regular basis.

But this time... I thought... ""Maybe this time it's different... Maybe I should give this man a chance. Maybe he is actually interested in the work that I'm doing, perhaps he is messaging me because he wants to set up a session."" So. I responded with a short and professional message. He then proceeded to get my business email and started not only emailing me but also sending me innaproproate messages over Google Hangouts. Predictable, yet it broke my heart.

I am asking each woman who has ever recieved innaproproate messages from men to reply to this message with a ❤️ or a ✊. For positive change to happen, first there has to be this awareness.

Let's stand together through this and show people that this common issue is not okay, we will continue standing up for what is right, and through bringing awareness in, make a positive change.💞 ~ Please pass this message on.

715,117,"@ Only women or femme ppl, please share some of your own experiences below relating to this subject. This whole topic deserves a bigger post later on. But I have two big posts I've been working on for a long time that I need to finish first. #feminist #intersectionalfeminism #girlpower #yesallwomen #womenoweyounothing",yesallwomen,"|The other day I was in a pub with female friend, we were pretty into conversation and waiting for our third friend and then we were about to leave. Two guys sit next to us and one of them asks: ”Is it okay to talk to you?” It was in the middle of me explaining something to my friend and I did not find him interesting in any way, so I just told him nicely: ”Well, we’re just about to leave.” He looks at me and says: ”So it’s NOT okay to talk to you?” I got pretty pissed but just told him no and continued my conversation. It was a really simple thing but I felt low-key threatened and only realized later why I got so annoyed: it felt like he was just asking for me to be rude with him so he could attack. There was something about his tone and I think only women can see what I mean. Only privileged men do this. For one, if two women are clearly talking, don’t interrupt. If you want to approach them, wait until there’s a gap in the conversation. Number two, if you ask a question and get an indirect no, just fucking take it. I felt like the guy was just begging for a chance to be mean about women always turning men down and being bitchy about it. I’m 100% sure that men know social cues just as well, if somebody says something like ”we’re just leaving” or ”we’re in the middle of a chat”, people, and yes, even men know what it means. In any other situation it’s clear but when it comes to men hitting on women, it’s suddenly supposed to be a world where any man can intrude on any woman’s space and time. And if she says no, how dare she! That’s a good enough reason to hate all the damn bitches! 🤬|A much older man approached me while I was having my tire fixed the other day. He kept asking when he could see me again and if I would give him a chance. I kept saying that I wasn't interested, but I couldn't leave because my car was being worked on and so was his. He kept telling me how gorgeous he thought I was and I kept playing it off with ""thank you, that's kind, I'm flattered"" but then he started talking about how he thought I was clean, that I take care of my hygiene and that he wouldn't mind tasting me. Then he slipped me his phone number and $10 and said to call him because he would ""take care of me and make it worth it""",66

721,123,"""The prosecutor probably appreciated the oppurtunity to run a trial with such a perfect complainant. I knew by then that if Sophie had been fifteen instead of twelve, they would have taken a different approach. They would have had to. It was a relief to see a jury not immediately suspicious of a complainant's testimony. Defence couldn't ask this little girl about what contraception she was on, then draw inferences to her promiscuity by reminding her that she also didn't have a boyfriend. They asked her what she was wearing to actually test her memory, not to suggest a shorter skirt had been selected to indicate willingness. She could, in no way whatsoever, have 'known what she was getting into' or 'asked for it' or 'made a drunken mistake that she regretted the next morning.' - Eggshell Skull by Bri Lee ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5 #EDRreads",yesallwomen,"|#eggshellskull #brilee #womenwritersoftheworld #femalewriters #metoo #fem2 #believewomen #whyididntreport #womensreality #timesup #iamanastywoman #heforshe #everydaysexism #heforshe #yesallwomen #hillsdistrictmums #girlmom #boymom #sydneymums|I think the story of Sophie was the most solid thing in the book.

726,128,"When I was 13, around the time I first got my period, my mom pointed out I was growing a ""ponch"". Her physiotherapist friend said maybe my uterus was tipped forward. In any case, my ""ponch"" or ""gut"" became the subject of obsession, concern, and ridicule, by my mother, by some female piers, and by me.⁣
⁣
See, the reason why my gut was distending out from my abdomen is because a large benign tumour was growing there. I'd later have an emergency surgery at 17 to remove it, but at the time, I felt like I was fucking failure for having a ""gut"" in a community of mostly thin, athletic, beautiful young women.⁣
⁣
Actually, the most traumatic part for me was I received all this negative energy being projected at my Energetic centre, my belly, and it wasn't my fault?⁣
⁣
But that against the point. Even if a girl has a rounder belly, or is gaining weight, it does not justify the criticism and judgement for her shape being directed at her. Especially around the time when a girl is going through puberty and developing her sense of self worth. That kind of negativity about her body is detrimental; by criticizing her shape you're essentially teaching her to hate herself.⁣
⁣
Is that what we want for young women?⁣
⁣
Fuck no.⁣
⁣
If a girl, or boy, is gaining noticeable weight around their abdomen, it is because, on some level, they are not feeling safe. The body is creating extra fat around the vital organs (and emotional centre) because it thinks its under attack. ⁣
⁣
Consider that in some aspect of their mental, emotional, or physical life, they feel under attack. Instead of expressing concern for their weight gain, express concern for their emotional well being. And ask yourself if your concern is coming from a place of love, or fear/insecurity/trauma? Support them in having a positive attitude toward their belly, their body. Encourage them to breath fully into their belly, instead of aggressively contracting it inwards in fear.⁣
⁣
Lets encourage young women to love their changing bodies, just as the Sun adores the morphing shape of the Earth as the Moon rotates around her, influencing her tides...",yesallwomen,"|#bodypositive #bodyneutral #stopbullying #loveyourself #naturalbeauty #femaleempowerment #womensupportingwomen #womensempowerment #empoweringgirls #yesallwomen #yesallgirls #mybodymychoice #fatisbeautiful #metoo #bodydismorphia #anorexia #bulimia|This is so helpful, supportive and brave to share, thank you 🙏🏼",8

Real talk: 1/5 women will be raped at some point in their lifetime. Nearly 1/10 women will be raped by an intimate partner, and many women will continue to see the predator in some shape or form following the incident. .
.
We know about these numbers, but what we don’t know about is the vast amount of unreported cases. This isn’t you? Think again. .
.
Abuse stretches beyond physical pain. Abuse is emotional, it’s disrespect, it’s not valuing the “different,” and it’s silencing those that wish to speak. .
.
Abuse does not always come from one place. It can come from a coworker, a boss, a friend, or a family member. .
.
No matter the type of abuse suppressing a persons voice, disregarding their wishes IS wrong, but what happens next is what matters most. .
.
Show up for yourself, and take action. .
.
If you ever feel like you haven’t been heard, listened to, or valued your throat chakra might be blocked.  The throat Chakra is signified by the color blue, and is viewed as our body’s place of self expression. .
.
Best way to combat this trauma? Work on opening up your throat chakra by a couple of easy techniques:
.
1. Find a creative outlet - dance, sing.
. 
2. Get out your feelings in a safe space- journal, tell your story to someone you trust.
.
3. Positive affirmations- “I release my fears that block me from speaking the truth.”.
.
4. Yoga poses- *bridge pose, *plow pose.
. 
5. Live your truth, and love all of yourself while doing it.

In the distance he saw a young boy picking up starfish, that had been tossed upon the shore after a storm, and carefully tossing them back into the ocean. The old man looked around the shore and saw hundreds of starfish laying upon the dry sand. He approached the young lad and said, ""There are too many for you you to save them all. You can't make a difference."" The young boy picked up another starfish and lovingly tossed it into the deep water saying, ""I may not be able to save them all, but to that one I made a difference.""

Good! Fear is good to have. But here's the secret... You have to start anyway! You are going to fail. You are going to suck. People will think what they want to think. It's not any of your business. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

You have to commit yourself to failure, suckage, and making mistakes. Want to know why? Because that's how you learn and get better. Just don't let the mistakes force you to stop.

743,145,"Ah yes, turns out, 20.5 months is how long it took for a man to accost me and attempt to assult me while I was running. This was my route, through streets that see plenty of traffic, and unfortunately a mentally unstable, older, possibly homeless man approached me with his hands out, yelling at me, trying to put his hands on me, and moving side to side to block my exit while I tried to get away (to my mom and MIL reading this right now, I am okay-- seriously-- and you don't need to call 😆). I've lived through plenty of stupid shit like this growing up in the city, but this is the closest I can remember that a dude got within a foot of actually attacking me.
After I realized he was yelling at me and not any of the dozen people around me, I took a headphone out and very loudly barked something to the effect of, ""SIR, YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM ME."" (Instinctively, I know to be polite to crazy men.) He was within a foot of me and he paused long enough for me to slip out to the right. I turned around and jogged away with my head turned to monitor him.
At the corner, I saw a yellow-shirt security guy and jogged across the street to tell him about the guy. If he was concerned, it did not come across, but I stressed that just because I got out okay didn't mean the next person on the street would, too. I hope he followed up and crossed the street. My adrenaline was high from being mid-run and I just needed to get away and keep running. Took a healthy amount of walk breaks to keep my heart rate down. Ugh.

Our world is dominated by phallic forms, so I say it’s time things got a little more yonic.

I think my biggest dream is to live by the sea. Somewhere slow and quiet. I’d love to live in walking distance of the sea, or a short drive away at a push. To have a couple of dogs I could walk every day, and then snuggle up with on the sofa at night. ⁣
⁣
I’d also love to earn enough to live comfortably. To be able to buy a house, clothe myself, travel, and eat good food. Just the thought of ending each day, looking at my life and thinking; “I did this, I made this happen.” is the one that keeps me going when times get rough.⁣

Today is #nativewomensequalpay day, a reminder, that on average in the U.S., Indigenous women are paid 42% less then white men. Simply put, indigenous women have to work almost 9 extra months to make what white men makes in just one year. 
We can’t get to equalize until we pay ALL women fairly!

785,187,"Consent is sexy.⁠ 👉🏽 What Consent Involves:⁠
⁠
Consent means the agreement given to a sexual partner at the moment the partners take part in sexual activities.⁠
⁠
This consent must be voluntary. This means that it must be given freely and not forced. Consent must also be informed.  Informed means that the person consenting understands the consequences of the decision. If the choice is not free and informed, then the person's consent is not valid.⁠
⁠
There is no consent if someone refuses to participate in a sexual activity but is forced into it anyway.⁠
⁠
Also, the consent must be clear, and it must be given personally by the person taking part in the sexual activity. Consent based on the words or actions of someone else is not valid.⁠
⁠
👉🏽 How Consent Must Be Given⁠
⁠
The law doesn't say exactly how consent to sexual activities must be given. It is enough that someone consents through words, through actions or both these ways. Therefore, consent doesn't have to be verbal or in writing.⁠

You just using your daughter as some sort of scapegoat to express your own political thoughts and opinions, without really sticking your own neck out there. It's like, I could just throw my own daughter under the bus because we all know that if it comes from a younger person political statements tend to carry significantly more weight which is very idiotic mindset. Especially in scenarios in which we think the less general life experience you have the more we should trust your opinion.|They're too busy talking about banning vapes|That never happened|Where is the talk about mental health?|Maybe you should reassure your daughter that the guard is there to stop that from happening instead of posting it on twitter 🤡 cuz twitter does so much|If you can’t trust the school to know who’s supposed to be there then you shouldn’t be sending the kid to that school.

798,200,"Don't be fooled by the small size of this book, it's not an easy, fun, page-turner, as the title might imply.
.
.
Five years ago bought this book along with The War On Women (see the first review on femi.books, it's a must-read!) and somehow I started reading, put it away, started reading again and put it away one more time. Now I've finally finished it because I wanted to review it. .
.
It's not like the essays are not interesting and necessary, they truly are. There are parts that are very important, hence the sticky notes. The topics that pass are sexism, poverty, mansplaining, misogyny, poverty, class warfare, rape, and sexual assault. But because of the amusing title, I thought that it would be an easy read, about Solnit her encounters with men. .

This book starts with the essay about mansplaining but from there on its mostly about violence against womxn. The best essays, in my opinion, are ‘The Longest war’, ‘Grandmother Spider’ and ‘#YesAllWomen’. Somehow I missed the #YesAllWomen movement, so it was really empowering to read about it. Some essays I found very dry and difficult to read, but that’s maybe personal. .
.
If you’re looking for a book about a number of important feminist topics at a basic level, you could read this. I think there are more suitable feminist books to read if you’re interested in learning about the topics Solnit discusses.

I have seen the cover in so many bookstagram accounts that I think Solnit's work is a must read. After reading your thoughts I think I will read it in small amounts between some novels so it won't be too heavy and I get time to ponder the topics.|Yeah, this book didn’t do much for me either. I also went into it thinking that it would be entirely about the concept of ‘mansplaining’ so was a bit surprised (and disappointed) to find out that wasn’t the case. Some of the essays were good, but as a whole I felt the book lacked a bit of depth and could have used a more intersectional lense. There are definetly better books that approach the same topics. “Good and Mad” was a great book that looked at similar topics with a less 101, and more intersectional approach.|I clicked on the #yesallwomen and the top post was about this judge who excused the rapist based on his family/grades/future. look at these brock turners turning up all over the place!|I read this over Christmas / New Year... there were elements that were not the most lighthearted festive reading!

Ariel Baillie♀️
Creative Artist

I have been drawing since I was able to pick up a crayon. I have always loved arts and crafts and creating anything that came to mind. Growing up as a very nomadic child I was exposed to different parts of the world at a very young age which opened up my mind to a whole new perspective.

I didnt start focusing on acrylic paintings until I moved to vancouver in 2018. The response I received from my pieces opened up opportunities I never thought could become a reality. It sparked something within me and I have never looked back.

As each piece I created recieved such different interpretations it hit me to want to portray a message that could mean more to someone than just ""I like that"". This is where I met the beautiful mind of Aubree.
I had done a couple sketches of females that I posted on an Instagram story and she asked me if she could use them. This being my first time that anyone has asked to collaborate on a piece I was Instantly intrigued.
The piece she created blew me out of the water and I never thought I could see my sketches come to life the way she merged them together and put colour into it. I feel like this piece is where it all started for TPIF to come to light.
To empower each other to create and be represented in the art world never has meant so much to me then this moment right now. To see creative minds of women come together and make an impact is exactly what we want to do with TPIF.
The time is now to go for our dreams and create a reality with our goals.
“Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.” – Meghan Markle

TPIF is created to empower women to use their gifts of creativity and show the arts community that they deserve the spotlight. Once we allow women to understand and exercise their power, they can remake the world.

824,226,"""I once had a mentor tell me that if you have an idea for a business, let funding be the last aspect you think about. If your foundation for a business concept is solid and you believe it in enough, you’ll find a way to come up with the money. That idea was really liberating for me as I was planning my shop, and allowed me to focus on my product assortment, branding, and overall concept without stressing over my finances. When the time was right for me to open, I was able to come up with the financing just as my mentor had said.

829,231,"Scaredy Cat

1.
His name is Worm.
His owner tells me
I'll understand
Once I see him slither.
She says he must not know
What a hiss means.
He runs away from me,
Leaves every room I enter.
Slowly, things change.
He stays on the bed
After I crawl into it. 
He smells my hand
But runs from it.
I tell him I understand
As he hisses at me
While I fill his bowl.
And I do.
One night, I catch him
On top of the couch 
At 2 am, looking defeated 
I reach out. He doesn't run.
It's the first time I touch his fur.
His neck is tense, eyes sad.
I tell him it's okay.
I don't tell him
I won't hurt him.
I don't control his pain.
After I stop,
He looks relieved
And desperate for more.
I tell him I understand.
And I do. 
Worm is a caterpillar,
Afraid of the cocoon 
After some excited child
Trapped him in a glass jar.
His tail is broken in half.
I tell him I don't know 
How to feel safe either.
I slither back into bed,
Hoping he'll follow me.
He doesn't.
I tell him I understand.
And I do.

2.
He jumps out of bed
To avoid me.
I follow him.
I get on my knees.
I say,
""I'm not who hurt you.""
His mouth is open
Mid hiss, he goes silent,
Pierces me with his stare.
I say,
""I'm not the one who hurt you,
But you can't forget.""
He blinks,
Closes his mouth.
His eyes are beautiful
And intense and sad.
I say,
""I can't forget either.""
He walks away
When I start crying.
My forehead 
Touches the floor.
We can't hold each other.
We are alone
In the nightmare worlds
We carry around,
Full of past.
Full of fear.

3.
His owner tells me
He hisses less now.
I send her a list of tips.
Do not give him food
Immediately after
He hisses, wait
Ten seconds or
Until he meows.
Give bits of food
While touching him
To pair safety with
Human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And I wonder if
I should make a list
For future lovers.
Do not hold me
Immediately after
I pull away, wait
A few minutes or
Until I say, “I’m scared.”
Give compliments
While touching me
To pair safety
With human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And if you are not ready
To love a creature
Who cannot forget,
Do not take me into
The warmth of your arms.
You will only make it worse.",yesallwomen,"|#vironikatugaleva #notallmen #yesallwomen #metoo #metoomovement #ptsd #trauma #traumapoetry #poetry #poet #writer #writing #instapoet #poemsofinstagram #poemsporn #wordswithqueens #poemsoftheday #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #mentalhealthquotes #realconvo #poetrysociety #poem #poetsofig #poetsofinstagram #abuse #survivorpoem #abusesurvivor #spilledink #poetryheals|Well, you succeeded in making me cry.

⁠
""When I came to, I was completely naked in bed and he was on top of me. I had no idea what was happening. My body was completely numb. I couldn't feel anything. My mind was rushing. I had no idea how I had gotten from the living room to the bedroom. I didn't know how to feel. I never really thought of it as rape, but now that I am a grown woman, I realize that I was raped by the guy I desperately wanted to want me.""⁠

This story is difficult to read. I know. But it is a reality that many women (and men) have faced. I recently discovered @rainn, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, an anti-sexual violence organization. They offer a plethora of resources to sexual assault survivors, including the national sexual assault hotline and online chat. If you or someone you know needs their help, they can be found at rainn.org.⁠
⁠
Thank you to S so bravely sharing her story. She was one of the first submissions I received and I knew her story was going to be a very important one for many.⁠

861,263,"Plus, you will make Kali Ma very proud lololololol.... But seriously, some spiritual people claim that using swear words ""lowers your vibration"", or that they've transcended the use of swearwords, and that's nice for them... Still, I've found using ""fuck off"" and the energy behind it very powerful when I've needed to stick up for myself and protect my space, and also when combatting fear.

The only time I don't swear is during ceremony, but I would strongly encourage young women, especially those who time and time again have had their voices squashed, stamped out, suppressed, to swear, in a good way, if this helps them tap into their anger and grief that they've been taught to ignore, and stuff down, in order to survive in their families and community dynamics.... Saying ""fuck off"", when it comes from a place of truth, to combat fear/worries/anxiety that's holding you back, to those who are bullying you, are trying control and manipulate you, to boys/girls/adults/others who time and time again overstep your boundaries, is not only useful, its incredibly healing, empowering. You are standing up for yourself, protecting yourself,  and aligning with your authenticity. Its liberating (as long as its done in a good way, ie not from a place of meanness). We need to teach girls and young women how to use their voices, to trust their intuition and act from that place, instead of letting people take advantage. There's a fine line between light bullying and harassment (which in many cases can very easily lead to various types of assault.) Its important for young women to feel empowered to protect themselves, both physically and energetically.

So, ladies, don't be afraid to tell unconscious idiots to fuck off. It is not only spiritual, but necessary, in many situations.

Goddess bless you,

Little Swan xoxo

_
It’s important to understand the different phases of your menstrual cycle. It’s not just a case of having your period, and not having your period. There are 4 distinct seasons.
_
In the 3rd episode of the Females in Tech Show, we talk about the perception society has about periods, and how women are charging through life, acting like men.
_
I share an example of when I didn’t honour my menstrual cycle, and how my body started to shut down as a result. I provide an overview of the 4 seasons of your menstrual cycle, and the superpowers women possess in each season - this is a biggie!
_
We also talk about how women can start syncing their workday in alignment with their cycle.

Stop shaming victims...this is the only reason that victims don't openly talk.. because they know you all will blame them for this..! And ofcourse no one would put a bucket of red paint on their face to make it appear as red paint.. for ✌just fame✌. !! .. Grow up people, grow up!! Rather than thinking this is fake, support her! She needs it !

And some of the people is also thinking that 5 years is too long for guys. FOR THE GUYS? REALLY? means you are trying to say, no guy can love a particular girl for long? Just let me clear you, if a man loves you then he will never leave leave until his last breath. And if you meant, guys get bore with time, then remember! REAL MAN DON'T SO THIS!! Am not a feminist but am in the support of what is true and what is wrong!! Talk when this happens to you or your any family member! You will feel this through your veins then!

Am so shameful that how this society changed to the worst! Can every bad thjns just stop for a while?.. There was a bunch of disrespectful comment. Everyone claiming ""FAKE!! ""

905,8,"Don't be fooled by the small size of this book, it's not an easy, fun, page-turner, as the title might imply.
.
.
Five years ago bought this book along with The War On Women (see the first review on femi.books, it's a must-read!) and somehow I started reading, put it away, started reading again and put it away one more time. Now I've finally finished it because I wanted to review it. .
.
It's not like the essays are not interesting and necessary, they truly are. There are parts that are very important, hence the sticky notes. The topics that pass are sexism, poverty, mansplaining, misogyny, poverty, class warfare, rape, and sexual assault. But because of the amusing title, I thought that it would be an easy read, about Solnit her encounters with men. .
.
This book starts with the essay about mansplaining but from there on its mostly about violence against womxn. The best essays, in my opinion, are ‘The Longest war’, ‘Grandmother Spider’ and ‘#YesAllWomen’. Somehow I missed the #YesAllWomen movement, so it was really empowering to read about it. Some essays I found very dry and difficult to read, but that’s maybe personal. .
.
If you’re looking for a book about a number of important feminist topics at a basic level, you could read this. I think there are more suitable feminist books to read if you’re interested in learning about the topics Solnit discusses.

I have seen the cover in so many bookstagram accounts that I think Solnit's work is a must read. After reading your thoughts I think I will read it in small amounts between some novels so it won't be too heavy and I get time to ponder the topics.|Yeah, this book didn’t do much for me either. I also went into it thinking that it would be entirely about the concept of ‘mansplaining’ so was a bit surprised (and disappointed) to find out that wasn’t the case. Some of the essays were good, but as a whole I felt the book lacked a bit of depth and could have used a more intersectional lense.

Ariel Baillie♀️
Creative Artist

I have been drawing since I was able to pick up a crayon. I have always loved arts and crafts and creating anything that came to mind. Growing up as a very nomadic child I was exposed to different parts of the world at a very young age which opened up my mind to a whole new perspective.

I didnt start focusing on acrylic paintings until I moved to vancouver in 2018. The response I received from my pieces opened up opportunities I never thought could become a reality. It sparked something within me and I have never looked back.

As each piece I created recieved such different interpretations it hit me to want to portray a message that could mean more to someone than just ""I like that"". This is where I met the beautiful mind of Aubree.
I had done a couple sketches of females that I posted on an Instagram story and she asked me if she could use them. This being my first time that anyone has asked to collaborate on a piece I was Instantly intrigued.
The piece she created blew me out of the water and I never thought I could see my sketches come to life the way she merged them together and put colour into it. I feel like this piece is where it all started for TPIF to come to light.
To empower each other to create and be represented in the art world never has meant so much to me then this moment right now. To see creative minds of women come together and make an impact is exactly what we want to do with TPIF.
The time is now to go for our dreams and create a reality with our goals.
“Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.” – Meghan Markle

TPIF is created to empower women to use their gifts of creativity and show the arts community that they deserve the spotlight. Once we allow women to understand and exercise their power, they can remake the world.

That idea was really liberating for me as I was planning my shop, and allowed me to focus on my product assortment, branding, and overall concept without stressing over my finances. When the time was right for me to open, I was able to come up with the financing just as my mentor had said.

1.
His name is Worm.
His owner tells me
I'll understand
Once I see him slither.
She says he must not know
What a hiss means.
He runs away from me,
Leaves every room I enter.
Slowly, things change.
He stays on the bed
After I crawl into it. 
He smells my hand
But runs from it.
I tell him I understand
As he hisses at me
While I fill his bowl.
And I do.
One night, I catch him
On top of the couch 
At 2 am, looking defeated 
I reach out. He doesn't run.
It's the first time I touch his fur.
His neck is tense, eyes sad.
I tell him it's okay.
I don't tell him
I won't hurt him.
I don't control his pain.
After I stop,
He looks relieved
And desperate for more.
I tell him I understand.
And I do. 
Worm is a caterpillar,
Afraid of the cocoon 
After some excited child
Trapped him in a glass jar.
His tail is broken in half.
I tell him I don't know 
How to feel safe either.
I slither back into bed,
Hoping he'll follow me.
He doesn't.
I tell him I understand.
And I do.

2.
He jumps out of bed
To avoid me.
I follow him.
I get on my knees.
I say,
""I'm not who hurt you.""
His mouth is open
Mid hiss, he goes silent,
Pierces me with his stare.
I say,
""I'm not the one who hurt you,
But you can't forget.""
He blinks,
Closes his mouth.
His eyes are beautiful
And intense and sad.
I say,
""I can't forget either.""
He walks away
When I start crying.
My forehead 
Touches the floor.
We can't hold each other.
We are alone
In the nightmare worlds
We carry around,
Full of past.
Full of fear.

3.
His owner tells me
He hisses less now.
I send her a list of tips.
Do not give him food
Immediately after
He hisses, wait
Ten seconds or
Until he meows.
Give bits of food
While touching him
To pair safety with
Human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And I wonder if
I should make a list
For future lovers.
Do not hold me
Immediately after
I pull away, wait
A few minutes or
Until I say, “I’m scared.”
Give compliments
While touching me
To pair safety
With human touch.
Don’t try to do 
Too much at once.
Let it happen slowly.
And if you are not ready
To love a creature
Who cannot forget,
Do not take me into
The warmth of your arms.
You will only make it worse.",yesallwomen,"|#vironikatugaleva #notallmen #yesallwomen #metoo #metoomovement #ptsd #trauma #traumapoetry #poetry #poet #writer #writing #instapoet #poemsofinstagram #poemsporn #wordswithqueens #poemsoftheday #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #mentalhealthquotes #realconvo #poetrysociety #poem #poetsofig #poetsofinstagram #abuse #survivorpoem #abusesurvivor #spilledink #poetryheals|Well, you succeeded in making me cry.

⁠
""When I came to, I was completely naked in bed and he was on top of me. I had no idea what was happening. My body was completely numb. I couldn't feel anything. My mind was rushing. I had no idea how I had gotten from the living room to the bedroom. I didn't know how to feel. I never really thought of it as rape, but now that I am a grown woman, I realize that I was raped by the guy I desperately wanted to want me.""⁠

- S, 31⁠

This story is difficult to read. I know. But it is a reality that many women (and men) have faced. I recently discovered @rainn, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, an anti-sexual violence organization. They offer a plethora of resources to sexual assault survivors, including the national sexual assault hotline and online chat. If you or someone you know needs their help, they can be found at rainn.org.⁠
⁠
Thank you to S so bravely sharing her story. She was one of the first submissions I received and I knew her story was going to be a very important one for many.⁠

After starting work at a bridal shop for around 7yrs, things began to change. Time spent with brides was less, working hours were difficult and Lottie realised it was time to branch out. A conversation was had with nearest & dearest and within two weeks Lottie’s Bridal Boutique - @lottiesbridal was born!! Lottie strives to create a beautiful environment with stunning dresses for every bride no matter the price, the size or anything else, where nothing is too much trouble and everyone is welcome.

968,71,"Plus, you will make Kali Ma very proud lololololol.... But seriously, some spiritual people claim that using swear words ""lowers your vibration"", or that they've transcended the use of swearwords, and that's nice for them... Still, I've found using ""fuck off"" and the energy behind it very powerful when I've needed to stick up for myself and protect my space, and also when combatting fear.

The only time I don't swear is during ceremony, but I would strongly encourage young women, especially those who time and time again have had their voices squashed, stamped out, suppressed, to swear, in a good way, if this helps them tap into their anger and grief that they've been taught to ignore, and stuff down, in order to survive in their families and community dynamics.... Saying ""fuck off"", when it comes from a place of truth, to combat fear/worries/anxiety that's holding you back, to those who are bullying you, are trying control and manipulate you, to boys/girls/adults/others who time and time again overstep your boundaries, is not only useful, its incredibly healing, empowering. You are standing up for yourself, protecting yourself,  and aligning with your authenticity. Its liberating (as long as its done in a good way, ie not from a place of meanness). We need to teach girls and young women how to use their voices, to trust their intuition and act from that place, instead of letting people take advantage. There's a fine line between light bullying and harassment (which in many cases can very easily lead to various types of assault.) Its important for young women to feel empowered to protect themselves, both physically and energetically.

So, ladies, don't be afraid to tell unconscious idiots to fuck off. It is not only spiritual, but necessary, in many situations.

Goddess bless you,

Little Swan xoxo

_
It’s important to understand the different phases of your menstrual cycle. It’s not just a case of having your period, and not having your period. There are 4 distinct seasons.
_
In the 3rd episode of the Females in Tech Show, we talk about the perception society has about periods, and how women are charging through life, acting like men.
_
I share an example of when I didn’t honour my menstrual cycle, and how my body started to shut down as a result. I provide an overview of the 4 seasons of your menstrual cycle, and the superpowers women possess in each season - this is a biggie!
_
We also talk about how women can start syncing their workday in alignment with their cycle.

Stop shaming victims...this is the only reason that victims don't openly talk.. because they know you all will blame them for this..! And ofcourse no one would put a bucket of red paint on their face to make it appear as red paint.. for ✌just fame✌. !! .. Grow up people, grow up!! Rather than thinking this is fake, support her! She needs it !

And some of the people is also thinking that 5 years is too long for guys. FOR THE GUYS? REALLY? means you are trying to say, no guy can love a particular girl for long? Just let me clear you, if a man loves you then he will never leave leave until his last breath. And if you meant, guys get bore with time, then remember! REAL MAN DON'T SO THIS!! Am not a feminist but am in the support of what is true and what is wrong!! Talk when this happens to you or your any family member! You will feel this through your veins then!

Am so shameful that how this society changed to the worst! Can every bad thjns just stop for a while?.. There was a bunch of disrespectful comment. Everyone claiming ""FAKE!! ""

1005,108,"It’s time for some real talk, y’all ⚠️
.
As a society we spend a ridiculous amount of time teaching girls to be nice
.
The reality is that women are expected to use far more finesse in our every day social interactions and kneecap just about everything we say—and we start teaching that from a very young age
.
And here’s the thing—how to be a kind human being is an unspeakably important thing to teach our children. Being respectful of others, being mindful of our interpersonal impact, and doing small acts of kindness go a long way
.
But let me be clear. Being kind should never come at the expense of our personal boundaries 🙅🏼‍♀️
.
Research has shown that when little girls stand up for themselves and assert their needs or say no they get labeled as “bossy” or as teenagers, “bitchy.” When boys do the same we call them “brave” and “strong.”
.
It is because of this that women are more likely to get put in the role of receptionist than of CEO. It is because of this that generations of women have stayed silent when bad things happened to them.
.
So instead let’s teach girls that being kind is important, but it is never worth losing your voice (sidenote: anyone else remember how Ariel in The Little Mermaid literally GAVE her voice away in exchange for a dude? 🤦🏼‍♀️🧜🏼‍♀️🐚 if that’s not symbolism IDK what is, amirite?)
.
Let’s teach girls to stand up for themselves, to articulate their needs clearly, and to stand their ground.
.
Let’s teach girls that being called a bitch can be a badge of honor if it’s because you stood up for yourself and made your voice heard 👊🏼
.
Let’s teach girls that having a voice is way cooler than being nice.",yesallwomen,"|Stfu|Yes!!! ❤️|Unlearning this behavior stemming from an outdated generation is difficult but necessary. 💖 thank you for this!|Yes!

1010,113,"#ptsd #metoo I have physical and mental health problems and am also an assault survivor. I had a few horrible years where I was so sick I could barely leave the house. But thankfully God is with me and I’ve been making progress with my worst illness and I’m trying to get out more. I was excited to go to a day time movie as a treat. But I didn’t see a movie. I was in the rest room exiting my stall to find a large man was urinating with his pants down with the stall door opened so I was exposed to his butt. I was immediately in shock, but was unsure what to do. I thought I could quickly wash my hands and get out, but before I could even get the water on I realized this was no mistake. This was a pervert in there on purpose. He suddenly jumped right next to me his pants were not even on correctly. He stood at the sink next to me and he kept getting closer until no space was between us. I was terrified as he spoke in a creepy voice saying “what’s wrong girl? It’s all good girl. What’s going on girl?” We locked eyes and I felt like I saw satan. His arm was starting to move and thankfully I ran. I couldn’t scream for help due to shock so I ran. I’m not allowed to run, sometimes I need an assistive device just to walk, but when you feel you are going to be harmed you have no choice. At this point I was distraught emotionally and not feeling well. He took a full five minutes to leave the bathroom and when a young employee verbally confronted him he said in his creepy voice “I really had to pee. Anyone would have done it”. I think not as the men’s room was literally next to it. I was too traumatized to see the film. He ran into a theater and I got my mom. By the time management came down, they were having trouble locating him. He ruined my day and I can’t stop freaking out, but obviously I thank God that I got away. It’s so upsetting I felt so safe in this nice suburban theater and now this. I just want other women to be safe from people like this. I’m scared if they don’t find him that he will keep doing this in other local theaters. #generalizedanxietydisorder  #truelifestories #yesallwomen #timesup #unacceptable",yesallwomen,"|Oh my gosh - this is awful!! I’m so sorry this happened to you!!! I am so glad you were able to get away. You might be aware of this, but when you start feeling upset, maybe try to cross your arms across your chest and tap your hand on your opposite upper arm, alternating your hands while tapping back and forth. Praying for the trauma to be healed. 🙏🏼😢|I’m so sorry this happened to you! That’s terrible!|Absolutely awful. I’m so sorry you went through that.|I am glad that you are OK, I’m so sorry that happened to you|I'm so glad you have the power to speak up and that you are using that power. It is never easy.

Just the fact you posted your terrible story shows how strong you are!!!!|I'm so sorry he did this to you! You reacted great, your safety is the  most important!

⁣
The bottom line is that Kavanaugh now faces (AT LEAST) THREE separate sexual misconduct allegations. ⁣
⁣
Each of them is corroborated to some extent, but during his confirmation hearing Kavanaugh issued BLANKET denials. ⁣
⁣
And in addition to detailing the new allegation, the Times reporters who spent months digging into the Kavanaugh allegations also note they found two previous allegations made against him to be credible.” - Aaron Rupar, Associate Editor @voxdotcom ⁣

I know it’s VERY unpopular to fully embrace the beauty and balance between masculine and feminine energy in a relationship. You are not alone, no matter WTH the media tries to make people believe, everybody is not falling for the strong-black-woman programming. One of my biggest strengths is the things I can do that a man CAN’T! There’s beauty in that, not weakness or inferiority. Sidebar: And black women need to stop saying “black men don’t protect black women” while also screaming you can do anything a man can do. YOU feed into the programming that you don’t NEED protection. 🙄 Make it make sense",yesallwomen,"|.

1045,148,"I truly believe that by doing the inner work, healing trauma in my own womb, and empower myself as a young womb, this in turn has a heals and empowers other young women and their wombs.

This may sound like a complicated and far-fetched concept, however, I feel you can apply the metaphor “As above, so below” and “your outer world is a reflection of your inner world” to this, as in, when you  change (for the better) you outer world start reflecting those changes back at you. 
This is something I’ve experiences myself time and time again, and it never ceases to amaze me. This same concept, I believe, can be applied to womb healing and women empowerment.

When I’m working on healing my belly/womb issues, liberating myself from sexual trauma and negative beliefs about myself that no longer serve me, I’m conscious of the fact that I’m not only doing this for myself, my ancestral line, and future generations to come, I’m also healing, energetically, all girls and women and their wombs/yoni’s. 
The results may not be apparent immediately, but I can feel the shift within me having an effect on the world around me, slowly slowly, like the currents moving through the oceans, carrying with them the songs of liberation and freedom and Love.

I find it difficult addressing old trauma’s that need addressing, especially as they relate to my belly and womb, but I find great strength in knowing that I not only do my healing work for myself, but that I do this for the good of other young women like myself, for the entire Earth, and all her beings.

This medicine is powerful and can create the change that is much needed in this world at present.

Love is the way forward and this is the path I walk, for the good of all.

Lots of love and light, and may the Goddess keep you strong on your own path,

Little Swan xoxo

1051,154,"Let’s talk about objectification.
.
I added some of the photos from this set to my modeling portfolio. I got a message from a random older man I have never met or interacted with, who started off by recommending I create a portfolio of more “tempting” photos, and went on to say “your poses look awkward, and don’t show off your figure”. As he went on to talk to himself in my inbox, it became increasingly clear he didn’t like my style because it wasn’t sexually appealing to him. He didn’t like the suit because it didn’t “accentuate my assets”. And I’m sure he hated seeing a young women not looking 100% feminine.
.
Let me be clear, I am not a product to be consumed. I refuse to be objectified. I am a person with feelings and goals and desires, and I deserve respect.
.
Almost daily I receive explicit messages and comments. Things like “I want you”, “show me your body”, or even “f$!k me”. THIS IS NOT OKAY. And as a woman in this field, it can feel like you have to just take it in order to get work.
.
If you know or care about a woman in a creative field, send her some love today, and if you see someone acting inappropriately, call them out.

I was just discussing with a friend how not only is there little to no accountability for perpetrators (rapists, abusers) but there is also very little accountability within the justice system, as well. I am grateful for those who take on civil duties and desire to protect and serve (lawyers, police officers). But let’s make no mistake that there are massive gaps in our justice system that leave victims and survivors in the wake of some of the most violating and heinous crimes feeling as though they are the ones who have done something wrong by coming forward. The statistics speak for themselves - both in how few cases are actually reported - and of those cases how many are ever prosecuted let alone sentenced (with any sort of meaningful sentence). I’ve witnessed firsthand the struggle as I’ve supported my wife through a recent attempted rape and enough is enough. Where are the political voices who are going to fight for laws that not only aid survivors, but that advocate for addressing the root cause? The utter lack of empathy within our ranks is abhorrent. We need to create meaningful change that eradicates this type of aggression and violence against others - and holds the guilty accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Crimes of sexual violence are exactly that - CRIMES. So why aren’t they treated that way?|“hE wIlL fAiL aCaDemIcaLLY iF yOu JaiL hIm” maybe he shoulda thought of that before becoming a royal douche and assaulting a woman.|The epitome of injustice..what an incredible judge😑setting out a great example out there.|🤮|breaks my heart. 😔|This is when we need vigilante justice.|So you're a ""high achieving"" white boy?

1081,184,"“I spent a lot of time thinking I was crazy , or that the pain and health issues that I was experiencing were all in my head. ⁠
I didn't understand why I was in so much pain.⁠
It wasn't normal for me to have such a hard time to walk, or sit, or move... this couldn't be normal. No one else was struggling. ⁠
I spent so much time and effort trying to be normal. Trying to look normal. ⁠
Trying to hide what I was feeling and dealing with.  I have never been so relieved as I was the day they gave me my diagnosis - it wasn't all in my head, ⁠
I wasn't crazy.”⁠
⁠
- Tanya B, 30⁠
⁠
⁠
Tanya was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis after years of pain. She had to be her own advocate until she found a doctor who took her seriously. Unfortunately, without treatment for all these years, her arthritis is more difficult to treat as much damage was done in the meantime. It takes so much strength to live with a disability, to not let it get you down, and Tanya's story is a reminder of that. ⁠

1084,187,"New work : Identity for Women’s and Girls’ Emergency Centre
_
Their enthusiasm for helping women in need is infectious, and we’re very proud to be supporting such an important and life-changing organisation. Tackling the precarious subject of domestic violence and homelessness had to be managed with respect, empathy and understanding. We needed to build a new brand identity that could reach those in need whilst broadening the awareness of the organisation. It’s been a truly rewarding experience to see the project unfold, with project lead, Rebecca Cini @Bec cini_ the broader FTP team, and all of the artistic collaborators all throwing themselves in to help without hesitation
_
The new logo responds to the urgency of their work, a shelter that points women to that critical piece of information in times of need - their contact details. Importantly, the identity drives a conversation and understanding about helping each other and building a community of support and assistance.

Some important things to know:
• Domestic violence is the biggest cause of homelessness for women. • On average, one woman a week is murdered in Australia by a current or former partner. • In 2015, 279,000 Australians sought help from homelessness services, 60% were women. • Australian police deal with domestic violence every two minutes.

⁣
YOU KNEW. ⁣
⁣
Even when on the outside (the illusion) it didn’t look like this was your path!!! ⁣
⁣
YOU KNEW. ⁣
⁣
Even through the tears because you were scared and that’s ok. ⁣
⁣
YOU KNEW. ⁣
⁣
Even when no one else understood what you were doing. ⁣
⁣
YOU KNEW⁣
⁣
And you kept on going. Blood sweat and tears but you have been and are, beyond your wildest dreams, successful (financially, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically) and it’s only getting better. ⁣
⁣
There is ALWAYS more to come because the universe is abundant. The only thing that is not is your mind. ⁣
⁣
To the $7 girl. You were always enough then just like you are enough now. Money doesn’t change that. It’s that you didn’t think less of yourself then. Even only with the $7. You never doubted your worthiness because you knew it was a phase and nothing defines you except your heart which is your soul. ⁣
⁣
THAT is what got you to this point. THAT is why you are here right now. THAT is why you can create a container for money to flow.⁣
⁣
🔥To the woman or man afraid to start a business wondering how will you ever make money or be “successful” in something especially if it’s non traditional. First of all hi to those fears. We see you. Then, F those fears! They are not truth. I’m living proof YOU CAN break through the matrix, be your authentic self, talk about shit some people gasp at, help people all around the world and make a living doing it!!!! ⁣
⁣
Pssst...it was understanding my astro chart that was the turning point in my life. Once I understood who I was everything in my life changed! I’m leaving the cart open for a few more hours if your heart still feels a yessss!!! Link in bio. ⁣

1124,227,Temps are starting to drop here in Denver and I'm excited that my first real Winter will be here before we know it! Growing up in Florida has so many incredible perks (hello beach hangs on Christmas Day) but there's a sort of Winter culture that I've always FOMO'd about and I'm excited to finally experience it this year.

Abortion is the termination of a baby while it is still in the womb of the mother. Just because the mother is connected to the baby, doesn't mean the baby is part of the women. The baby is dependent on the mother, the baby isn't part of the mother. Why would you justify killing a baby by saying that it's part of the mom. It's like this, abortion is murder, I understand to some degree wanting to have an abortion after being raped.

1131,234,"It was such an honor meeting with the prep school girls today. We spoke about the importance of remaining true to yourself and how when trying to be someone else, it only causes more suffering within. 
Through our activity we gave them time to reflect/ write down things they value about themselves. We shared our own personal stories to give them real life examples of how we were able to release suffering. 
In being mutually vulnerable, the girls we were able to connect more deeply, share and be heard. 
A big reminder to us all, that we are more alike than we are different. ❤️ Continue to support Project Mujeres, link in our bio.

“I’ll go with the cheaper option coz it’s cheaper...” you then end up paying more than double as the results you were hoping for don’t matérialise and you end up re-investing in the person you originally wanted to invest in but who you thought was “too expensive”⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

1148,251,"It's okay to be angry with the ones who hurt you, abused you, violated you. Feel that anger, honour it, validate your own feelings around the trauma and that the situation was out of your control and not your fault, and express that anger.⁣
⁣
I always feel that fire ceremonies are a powerful way of expressing and letting go of anger and grief. I do this through writing down everything that I wish to around my anger, fear, and grief on paper, then I tear up the paper into bits and place each piece individually into my ceremonial fire, with a prayer/blessing. Then I watch my words burn and turn to ash, returned to our earthly Mother.⁣
⁣
This death by fire creates space for new life to emerge, and most of all, for healing to occur.⁣
⁣
This is why I choose to use an image of Pele, a goddess of fire and volcano, one who've I've loved since the age of six. Like Kali, I feel she is misunderstood as being a purely destructive, malevolent diety, at least to those who do not understand the transformative and necessary healing power of the end of a cycle. I find her fire comforting, when I look upon her image I feel her warmth and motherly embrace. I feel a child again in her arms, comforted, nurtured, protected, and above all, validated.⁣
⁣
I feel these fiery Mother Goddesses are powerful allies when it comes to healing trauma, and all feelings surrounding that, including anger and grief. To climb a volcano and offer a pearl or vanilla, or fruit, things not found on volcanoes, would be a beautiful offering to one such as Pele, and empowering for yourself. Better yet, climb that volcano and offer your menstrual blood direct from your womb to the volcano goddess. Now there's a powerful medicine!⁣
⁣
Brightest blessing and may the goddess watch over you,⁣
⁣
Little Swan xoxo⁣

So I took a break from social media...with the #femicideinSA blow up, all the #MeToo sharing (which, don’t get me wrong, NEEDS to be said), as well as the overwhelming amount of judgemental comments from women TO women, I just felt like it was getting me down and honestly, it just got be too much for me to handle...so I stepped back.
.
When I came back, I noticed that instead of the (more vocal) men being supportive and understanding, everywhere I looked I saw the use of the #menaretrash hashtag being taken out of context. 😣

In light of that and in a hopeful attempt to bring more unity through better understanding, I felt this quote needed to be said... .

1160,263,"Hello Winter, it’s time to retreat and tune in. 
_
Today is Day One of my bleed / menstrual cycle, and I’m doing my best to honor this phase in my cycle. 
_
Working in tech comes with its benefits like working from home. However it also comes with its challenges, particularly if you work in delivery & implementation and have a customer facing role. 
_
Typically during this time I would work from home in my pjs, or take the day off if the pain is too severe. 
_
However I’m right in the middle of migration from TEST to PROD for one of my clients, so I don’t have that flexibility. Reality is, working women don’t always have this flexibility and some months we do have to charge through the day. 
_
Over the years I’ve learnt how I can still honor my cycle when I am in the heavy lift of a project. Here are 6 practices I implement during this time:
_
1. Stay in bed as long as possible. This morning I was awake at 5am but didn’t get out of bed till 6:15. I said little love prayers to my period, thanking the universe for being a woman.
_
2. When you’re at home let your bleed flow. Where a pad or cup, and allow yourself to be in flow and really honor this sacred experience.
_
3. Minimal exercise... short nature walks, short yoga practice (although there are some positions you should avoid - please be careful), or a light Pilates session.
_
4. Move in flow with the moon: if you’re bleeding on a Full Moon, you’re likely to feel more creative. Whereas bleeding on a New Moon you’re likely to be more aligned with, and re-evaluate your life and purpose.
_
5. Practice gratitude. This is a really beautiful time to journal and reflect on the last month.
_
6. Meditate. I like to place my hands on my womb and focus all my energy to it. You may get really vulnerable here, so please be in a safe space with this practice.
_
The main thing is to be gentle on yourself. Move slower. Stay off your phone. Connect with Mother Nature and take the time to fill your self love bucket. Tune in and discover what feels right for you.",yesallwomen,"|#girlswhocode #girlboss #girlpower #girlsintech #womenwholead #bossladymindset #feminist #empoweringwomen #womenintechnology #workingwomen #femaleentrepreneur #timesup #iamanastywoman #yesallwomen #fem2 #tothegirls #effyourbeautystandards #addwomen

A powerful message from Ruth Mojeed, who believes that there is still a lot to be said for representation. She asserted that ""women need mentors in other women, and women need sponsors in other women—a dynamic that needs a shift in traditional power structures from men to women."" In this modern age, this message is more vital than ever. ⠀

1164,267,"A tough reminder: just because something doesn’t happen now, doesn’t mean it won’t happen at all.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I was served a fresh dose of reality last week. In the midst of work-induced stress, I found myself in a client meeting advising directors with crisis management. As I looked around the room at these experienced faces (looking to me for advice!) I had a brief moment of realization of just how far I’ve come in my career.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I would’ve been completely confused if you told me three years ago that I would be in this position now, because three years ago, I applied to work at this same company, in a simple entry-level position. I felt SO sure I was qualified, worked hard on the application, and thought I’d at least snag an interview. I never heard a peep back from the hiring manager. I was defeated.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Three years later, that same hiring manager reached out ME to consult for THEM. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Damn, what a confidence boost.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
The world has a funny way of bringing things full circle. We don’t always realize the potential of connections and opportunities until days, months, or even years later. When there’s always a new goal to achieve or job to secure, it can be hard to look back at our progress, be thankful for where we are, and patient for where we want to go. Hang in there, babes. —Morgan 📸: @pfcandleco #babeswhohustle",yesallwomen,"|.⁣⠀

⁠⠀
I didn't get to play sports growing up. My little brothers did. I was never encouraged. I used to think it was because we were poor, but I think my family just didn't believe in girls being physically fit.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Sometimes, I wonder how different life might have been if I was encouraged to play softball, volleyball, or basketball like one of my confident, out-going childhood friends. Maybe it wouldn't have taken 26 years to realize how strong, capable, & worthy I am.⁠⠀

1172,275,"Posted @withrepost • @stashawashburn When you’re on hormonal birth control that bleed you have is not a period. You need to ovulate to have a “real” period. A bleed that causes your body to get the healthy hormones you need for both short and long term health.
❣️
A withdrawal bleed from birth control (BC) is just that, a bleed caused by the withdrawal of chemicals used to shut down your ovaries. You’re in a state of menopause when on hormonal BC. So that period, while it may feel like a regular period, is not a healthy period.
❣️
Some possibilities of hormonal BC effects on your body? Increased hormonal imbalances, heart disease, early osteoporosis, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, worse skin/hair/nails, even things like cavities increasing!
❣️
Now there are no long term studies of BC and it’s affects on women, but we do know the health risks we face. Now it’s time learn what to do next. I hope you’ll grab my book and support the upcoming Bloody Revolution!

My 12-14 days a month bleeding, my crippling pain, my constant diarrhea. That was my real period. My 2 economy boxes of tampons and 2 giant bags of pads each month. That was my real period. Genetics are a tricky bitch, and for anyone to tell another woman her period isn't real is a shit move.|how do u stop periods altogether?|This post is BS. In appropriate patients (non smokers, healthy weight, no hypertension for example), birth control pills are safe and effective. Your risks of blood clots are MUCH higher if pregnant.  And being on pills for 5 yrs decreases your risk of ovarian cancer. It has not been shown to cause or increase risk of breast cancer.
If a woman doesn’t tolerate pills, of course other contraceptive methods should be considered such as IUDs. #bogus #contraception #debunked #imagynecologist",13

The desire to be successful, wealthy, accomplished, and relevant particularly to our families can be stifling and overwhelming!! We always say we can't wait to get to a point of rest where finances seize to become a problem..but to be honest if that's what we're chasing that stage in life is almost an enigma. Ask very wealthy people and they'll be quick to tell you that with immense wealth comes immense anxiety!! Some people in Nigeria desire desperately to live abroad, sayi g if they do their lives will be perfect!! Those of us in the diaspora who want to be honest will tell you that living abroad is not a heavenly lifestyle, and quite frankly could be worse than living in Nigeria. I'll tell the story of diaspora living on another day!!

*TRIGGER WARNING* - sexual, physical, and verbal abuse
.
Behavioral Health Specialist Evette Bass answers questions about what trauma looks like, how it affects people, how to help loved ones who’ve survived traumatic events, and some early steps in the healing process. If you are interested in asking Evette questions about the interview or about trauma, she is available in the Facebook Community, Shouting About The Silence Community. .
.
It is extremely common to have experienced trauma, and everyone knows someone who has been through something traumatic. @ebet.cha has a bunch of little nuggets of wisdom to help you better understand what is happening, and to get you on the road the healing. .
.
Trauma doesn’t fit into a neat and tidy box. It looks different for everyone, and there are no magic wands or simple solutions. But the resource that Evette recommends is “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma.” @thebodykeepsthescore .

2 pages that I have found that have been helpful for me personally are @traumaawarecare @traumabreakthrough. .

Whether your fear of missing out is for social or financial or spiritual reasons, acknowledge that you do not need to be everywhere. Acknowledge that you cannot be everywhere! Acknowledge that you cannot always run, always give, always be active. ⁣
⁣
Acknowledge, dear one, that you need stillness. You need space and time for quietness. You need periods of inwardness. You need to listen closely to what your body is whispering. ⁣
⁣
At MWF we want to help you develop your ability to keep still and let go of habits that do not serve you. ⁣
⁣
To help develop stillness during the festival, our main lounge will be SILENT during lunch each day. To give you space to integrate. To help you practice being still with yourself in a community setting. To offer you space to stay connected and mindful, even amidst a good-crazy festival, and surrounded by 300 of your new female friends. ⁣

⁣
YOU KNEW. ⁣

And you kept on going. Blood sweat and tears but you have been and are, beyond your wildest dreams, successful (financially, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically) and it’s only getting better. ⁣
⁣
There is ALWAYS more to come because the universe is abundant. The only thing that is not is your mind. ⁣
⁣
To the $7 girl. You were always enough then just like you are enough now. Money doesn’t change that. It’s that you didn’t think less of yourself then. Even only with the $7. You never doubted your worthiness because you knew it was a phase and nothing defines you except your heart which is your soul. ⁣
⁣
THAT is what got you to this point. THAT is why you are here right now. THAT is why you can create a container for money to flow.⁣

Most of all shut the fuck up.|Truth|Anyone with even half a brain cell understands that abortion is wrong, point blank. Abortion is the termination of a baby while it is still in the womb of the mother. Just because the mother is connected to the baby, doesn't mean the baby is part of the women. The baby is dependent on the mother, the baby isn't part of the mother. Why would you justify killing a baby by saying that it's part of the mom. It's like this, abortion is murder, I understand to some degree wanting to have an abortion after being raped.

1233,37,"It was such an honor meeting with the prep school girls today. We spoke about the importance of remaining true to yourself and how when trying to be someone else, it only causes more suffering within. 
Through our activity we gave them time to reflect/ write down things they value about themselves. We shared our own personal stories to give them real life examples of how we were able to release suffering. 
In being mutually vulnerable, the girls we were able to connect more deeply, share and be heard. 
A big reminder to us all, that we are more alike than we are different. ❤️ Continue to support Project Mujeres, link in our bio.

1250,54,"It's okay to be angry with the ones who hurt you, abused you, violated you. Feel that anger, honour it, validate your own feelings around the trauma and that the situation was out of your control and not your fault, and express that anger.⁣
⁣
I always feel that fire ceremonies are a powerful way of expressing and letting go of anger and grief. I do this through writing down everything that I wish to around my anger, fear, and grief on paper, then I tear up the paper into bits and place each piece individually into my ceremonial fire, with a prayer/blessing. Then I watch my words burn and turn to ash, returned to our earthly Mother.⁣
⁣
This death by fire creates space for new life to emerge, and most of all, for healing to occur.⁣
⁣
This is why I choose to use an image of Pele, a goddess of fire and volcano, one who've I've loved since the age of six. Like Kali, I feel she is misunderstood as being a purely destructive, malevolent diety, at least to those who do not understand the transformative and necessary healing power of the end of a cycle. I find her fire comforting, when I look upon her image I feel her warmth and motherly embrace. I feel a child again in her arms, comforted, nurtured, protected, and above all, validated.⁣
⁣
I feel these fiery Mother Goddesses are powerful allies when it comes to healing trauma, and all feelings surrounding that, including anger and grief. To climb a volcano and offer a pearl or vanilla, or fruit, things not found on volcanoes, would be a beautiful offering to one such as Pele, and empowering for yourself. Better yet, climb that volcano and offer your menstrual blood direct from your womb to the volcano goddess. Now there's a powerful medicine!⁣
⁣
Brightest blessing and may the goddess watch over you,⁣
⁣
Little Swan xoxo⁣

So I took a break from social media...with the #femicideinSA blow up, all the #MeToo sharing (which, don’t get me wrong, NEEDS to be said), as well as the overwhelming amount of judgemental comments from women TO women, I just felt like it was getting me down and honestly, it just got be too much for me to handle...so I stepped back.

When I came back, I noticed that instead of the (more vocal) men being supportive and understanding, everywhere I looked I saw the use of the #menaretrash hashtag being taken out of context. 😣

1262,66,"Hello Winter, it’s time to retreat and tune in. 
_
Today is Day One of my bleed / menstrual cycle, and I’m doing my best to honor this phase in my cycle. 
_
Working in tech comes with its benefits like working from home. However it also comes with its challenges, particularly if you work in delivery & implementation and have a customer facing role. 
_
Typically during this time I would work from home in my pjs, or take the day off if the pain is too severe. 
_
However I’m right in the middle of migration from TEST to PROD for one of my clients, so I don’t have that flexibility. Reality is, working women don’t always have this flexibility and some months we do have to charge through the day. 
_
Over the years I’ve learnt how I can still honor my cycle when I am in the heavy lift of a project. Here are 6 practices I implement during this time:
_
1. Stay in bed as long as possible. This morning I was awake at 5am but didn’t get out of bed till 6:15. I said little love prayers to my period, thanking the universe for being a woman.
_
2. When you’re at home let your bleed flow. Where a pad or cup, and allow yourself to be in flow and really honor this sacred experience.
_
3. Minimal exercise... short nature walks, short yoga practice (although there are some positions you should avoid - please be careful), or a light Pilates session.
_
4. Move in flow with the moon: if you’re bleeding on a Full Moon, you’re likely to feel more creative. Whereas bleeding on a New Moon you’re likely to be more aligned with, and re-evaluate your life and purpose.
_
5. Practice gratitude. This is a really beautiful time to journal and reflect on the last month.
_
6. Meditate. I like to place my hands on my womb and focus all my energy to it. You may get really vulnerable here, so please be in a safe space with this practice.
_
The main thing is to be gentle on yourself. Move slower. Stay off your phone. Connect with Mother Nature and take the time to fill your self love bucket. Tune in and discover what feels right for you.",yesallwomen,"|#girlswhocode #girlboss #girlpower #girlsintech #womenwholead #bossladymindset #feminist #empoweringwomen #womenintechnology #workingwomen #femaleentrepreneur #timesup #iamanastywoman #yesallwomen #fem2 #tothegirls #effyourbeautystandards #addwomen

A powerful message from Ruth Mojeed, who believes that there is still a lot to be said for representation. She asserted that ""women need mentors in other women, and women need sponsors in other women—a dynamic that needs a shift in traditional power structures from men to women."" In this modern age, this message is more vital than ever. ⠀

⁠⠀
I was served a fresh dose of reality last week. In the midst of work-induced stress, I found myself in a client meeting advising directors with crisis management. As I looked around the room at these experienced faces (looking to me for advice!) I had a brief moment of realization of just how far I’ve come in my career.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I would’ve been completely confused if you told me three years ago that I would be in this position now, because three years ago, I applied to work at this same company, in a simple entry-level position. I felt SO sure I was qualified, worked hard on the application, and thought I’d at least snag an interview. I never heard a peep back from the hiring manager. I was defeated.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Three years later, that same hiring manager reached out ME to consult for THEM. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Damn, what a confidence boost.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
The world has a funny way of bringing things full circle. We don’t always realize the potential of connections and opportunities until days, months, or even years later. When there’s always a new goal to achieve or job to secure, it can be hard to look back at our progress, be thankful for where we are, and patient for where we want to go. Hang in there, babes. —Morgan 📸: @pfcandleco #babeswhohustle",yesallwomen,"|.⁣⠀

⁠⠀
I didn't get to play sports growing up. My little brothers did. I was never encouraged. I used to think it was because we were poor, but I think my family just didn't believe in girls being physically fit.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Sometimes, I wonder how different life might have been if I was encouraged to play softball, volleyball, or basketball like one of my confident, out-going childhood friends. Maybe it wouldn't have taken 26 years to realize how strong, capable, & worthy I am.⁠⠀

1274,78,"Posted @withrepost • @stashawashburn When you’re on hormonal birth control that bleed you have is not a period. You need to ovulate to have a “real” period. A bleed that causes your body to get the healthy hormones you need for both short and long term health.
❣️
A withdrawal bleed from birth control (BC) is just that, a bleed caused by the withdrawal of chemicals used to shut down your ovaries. You’re in a state of menopause when on hormonal BC. So that period, while it may feel like a regular period, is not a healthy period.
❣️
Some possibilities of hormonal BC effects on your body? Increased hormonal imbalances, heart disease, early osteoporosis, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, worse skin/hair/nails, even things like cavities increasing!
❣️
Now there are no long term studies of BC and it’s affects on women, but we do know the health risks we face. Now it’s time learn what to do next. I hope you’ll grab my book and support the upcoming Bloody Revolution!

My 12-14 days a month bleeding, my crippling pain, my constant diarrhea. That was my real period. My 2 economy boxes of tampons and 2 giant bags of pads each month. That was my real period. Genetics are a tricky bitch, and for anyone to tell another woman her period isn't real is a shit move.|how do u stop periods altogether?|This post is BS. In appropriate patients (non smokers, healthy weight, no hypertension for example), birth control pills are safe and effective. Your risks of blood clots are MUCH higher if pregnant.  And being on pills for 5 yrs decreases your risk of ovarian cancer. It has not been shown to cause or increase risk of breast cancer.
If a woman doesn’t tolerate pills, of course other contraceptive methods should be considered such as IUDs. #bogus #contraception #debunked #imagynecologist",13

1277,81,"When you’re on hormonal birth control that bleed you have is not a period. You need to ovulate to have a “real” period. A bleed that causes your body to get the healthy hormones you need for both short and long term health.
❣️
A withdrawal bleed from birth control (BC) is just that, a bleed caused by the withdrawal of chemicals used to shut down your ovaries. You’re in a state of menopause when on hormonal BC. So that period, while it may feel like a regular period, is not a healthy period.
❣️
Some possibilities of hormonal BC effects on your body? Increased hormonal imbalances, heart disease, early osteoporosis, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, worse skin/hair/nails, even things like cavities increasing!
❣️
Now there are no long term studies of BC and it’s affects on women, but we do know the health risks we face. Now it’s time learn what to do next. I hope you’ll grab my book and support the upcoming Bloody Revolution!

If your answer is yes, think again. Not knowing is the greatest life motivator.🌏🌏🌏

So enjoy, endure, survive each moment as it comes to you in its proper sequence -- a surprise.🌏🌏🌏

The desire to be successful, wealthy, accomplished, and relevant particularly to our families can be stifling and overwhelming!! We always say we can't wait to get to a point of rest where finances seize to become a problem..but to be honest if that's what we're chasing that stage in life is almost an enigma. Ask very wealthy people and they'll be quick to tell you that with immense wealth comes immense anxiety!! Some people in Nigeria desire desperately to live abroad, sayi g if they do their lives will be perfect!! Those of us in the diaspora who want to be honest will tell you that living abroad is not a heavenly lifestyle, and quite frankly could be worse than living in Nigeria. I'll tell the story of diaspora living on another day!! So BREATHING and finding at whatever stage you find yourself is literally imperative so you don't lose your mind or get bent out of shape!!|Beautiful message",62

1286,90,"*New Episode* “Trauma in a nutshell is the awful experiences that people have gone through. Any violation against yourself that you can repress, numb, or express.” .
*TRIGGER WARNING* - sexual, physical, and verbal abuse
.
Behavioral Health Specialist Evette Bass answers questions about what trauma looks like, how it affects people, how to help loved ones who’ve survived traumatic events, and some early steps in the healing process. If you are interested in asking Evette questions about the interview or about trauma, she is available in the Facebook Community, Shouting About The Silence Community. .
.
It is extremely common to have experienced trauma, and everyone knows someone who has been through something traumatic. @ebet.cha has a bunch of little nuggets of wisdom to help you better understand what is happening, and to get you on the road the healing. .
.
Trauma doesn’t fit into a neat and tidy box. It looks different for everyone, and there are no magic wands or simple solutions. But the resource that Evette recommends is “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma.” @thebodykeepsthescore .
. 
2 pages that I have found that have been helpful for me personally are @traumaawarecare @traumabreakthrough. .
.
The domestic abuse hotline number is 800-799-7233.

If you are interested in a synopsis of the interview that excludes any examples of abuse, please head over to the website!

Whether your fear of missing out is for social or financial or spiritual reasons, acknowledge that you do not need to be everywhere. Acknowledge that you cannot be everywhere! Acknowledge that you cannot always run, always give, always be active. ⁣
⁣
Acknowledge, dear one, that you need stillness. You need space and time for quietness. You need periods of inwardness. You need to listen closely to what your body is whispering. ⁣
⁣
At MWF we want to help you develop your ability to keep still and let go of habits that do not serve you. ⁣
⁣
To help develop stillness during the festival, our main lounge will be SILENT during lunch each day. To give you space to integrate. To help you practice being still with yourself in a community setting. To offer you space to stay connected and mindful, even amidst a good-crazy festival, and surrounded by 300 of your new female friends. ⁣

Between a chemo infusion or house payment. It’s heartbreaking 💔|Don’t disagree. But also the US gets almost all the newest drugs first. I hate for a choice like that to ever be about money - but I’d also be glad to be in the US and have the choice at all.|I agree. But you can have a functioning public system with private healthcare co-existing. I don’t really care if some rich person pays to have a single room or some fancy expert flown in. Hopefully the hospital will make a good profit of it to pay their employees well. 
Also in an exclusively public system, I’d be fucked if I needed a doctor when visiting (or immigrants), because usually these are for legal citizens only. I’m sure you’d want a system that admits anyone in need, but I think it will be difficult to get a broad consensus on this.|I think that’s a bit too far. I believe strongly in complete healthcare! However, single payer systems don’t support these kinds of care - they generally would still require pay out of pocket for extending life. Palliative and life extending therapies in most countries with single payer are almost impossible to get. I’m 100% for pushing Medicaid expansion, and making Medicaid nationally consistent. But Medicare is a almost useless program as is, and while I *agree* the system of private care, Medicaid and Medicare all need a massive overhaul, we’re ignoring the *many* people who’d care would be compromised or excluded from a national program. We wouldn’t be empowering doctors to treat patients as needed, we would just be substituting the government deciding what care we deserve instead of insurance companies. I’m all for solutions, I’m just doubtful this particular idea is the solution.|Yet you still support abortions? 😭|This is complete horseshit. My child didn't have cancer. Instead, he was born with a massive hole in his heart. No fault of his own, no fault of mine, the heart is formed before many women even know they are pregnant. And did I expect anyone to pay for his medical care? Abso-fucking-lutely NOT. It was my choice to have a child. And I will pay whatever ungodly amount of money necessary to give him the best, healthiest chance at life. His open heart surgery was approx a quarter of a million dollars. And that is NOT taxpayers responsibility. They didn't help me choose to reproduce, why should they have to pay?! Y'all want every women to have a choice about their bodies and reproduction - cool. But y'all don't want taxpayers to decide who gets to foot that kids medical bills?! GTFO.",750

Aber um so merh das schätzt was er hat 😍... jemand der sich Gedanken um das Leben macht  und nicht wie er sein Augenbrauen zupft oder was er anzieht .  Das ist Frauen Sache :)|Bad Boys sind meistens so cool dass sie vollkommen von sich eingenommen sind. Sie vermitteln einem das Gefühl, niemals so etwas Lächerliches wie Gefühle zu haben geschweige denn Gefühle für eine Frau. Für viele Ladys liegt genau darin der Reiz. ""Bekomme ich ihn wohl dazu, sich in mich zu verlieben?""|Du bist Hammer und ich muss gestehen wir sind einer Meinung! @iamjennyfromtheblog|Hallo Jenny, dein neues Konzept mit diesen Videos ist Entertainment pur das auch gute Denkanstöße gibt. Und darf ich mal erwähnen wie gut deine Outfitkreationen zur Geltung kommen? Weiter so 👏🏽|😊👍🏾|Was für krasse  grade zähne sie hat 😍|@sallymaatz erzähl mal die Gründe warum du auf Bad Boys stehst und seh dir das Video an sehr interessant|Ich stehe auch eher auf Nerds und da ich eine sehr dominierende Frau bin und es mir sehr schwer fällt dem Mann die Kontrolle zu übergeben finde ich es dennoch schön wenn ein Mann seinen Mann stehen kann aber meiner Absicht nach muss er sehr auf mich eingehen und viel Humor haben ☺️|Frauen haben keine Rechte 🤪😂|Ich glaube das nur Frauen auf Bad Boys stehen die das ganze noch nicht durch gemacht haben,sie wissen es nicht wie es ist mit so einem Menschen zu leben und wohl möglich noch Kinder damit zuhaben. Es ist der Reiz den Mann zu verändern als Beispiel,,Bei mir wäre er nicht so! Ich bekomme ihn schon rum/weich oder auch mit mir würde er ja nicht so umgehen. Ich denke das dass Image anziehend ist der Bad Boy strahlt Stärke Selbstbewusstsein Standhaftigkeit Sexappeal aus was oft leider nur mehr Schein als sein ist...|@pankedli brooo absolut was für dich hahahaha|Ich stehe auf eine Mischung von beiden . Er sollte nicht bei jeder Sache was ich mache : Amen und ja sagen ! Dennoch sollte er mich nicht zwingen alles zu machen . Du muss dies , das weil ich der dominante bin usw.  Mir verbieten Kontakt mit anderen aufzunehmen , aber andersrum ist okay .. Ich glaube wir stehen auf Bad boys , weil die "" Stärke "" zeigen und man sich geschützt fühlt .. verkehrte Welt ..|was macht einen badboy aus|Ich glaube viele Frauen verwechseln bad boy mit Mann! Ein Bad boy kann dir doch garnicht gut tun. Klar will ich jemanden der auf den Tisch haut und hinter mir steht. Aber genauso mit mir seine weiche Seite zeigt. Bad boy ala er baut nur scheiße und ich muss permanent darunter leiden will keiner. Ich hab Gott sei dank einen Partner gefunden der zwar angsterregend für andere ist aber für mich nicht. Der egal was für scheiße er baut, sich bewusst ist das er mich in den Schlamassel auch mit rein zieht. Und aufgrund dessen er von vorrein weiß was er dich für mich wünscht und was nicht.|Ein BadBoy is für mich wie nh lustige aber auch anstrengende Reise ins Ausland man hat es am Anfang ganz verlockend gefunden auch interessant und spannend aber wenn man dann aus dem Ausland wieder back is war es nh erfahren und lehrreich aber meistens will man da nicht mehr zurück 
Weil die Sonne am Strand hat dann doch mehr Sonnenbrand als nur angenehme Wärme gegeben ☀️|Ist das eine Perücke oder sind die richtig rein gemacht?|Ist das eine Perücke oder sind die richtig rein gemacht?|Bad boys sind einfach heiß😭|Hey @iamjennyfromtheblog ich habe ein Problem kannst du auf mein DM schauen brauche deine Hilfe❤️|Weil Papa so einer war und weil die Tochter Papas Prinzessin sein möchte. Wenn Daddy aber narzistische Züge hat kämpft die Prinzessin das Leben lang um seine Liebe, das wiederholt sich später beim Partner.|Ich denke viele Frauen stehen auf Bad Boys, weil wir in uns diese Art Mutterinstinkt haben und uns erstmal einbilden, wir könnten die „schlimmen Kerle“ „bekehren“ 
auf den richtigen Weg bringen.Was auch immer 😂Der Bad Boy wird zur Lebensaufgabe, bis man irgendwann aufgibt und keine Kraft mehr hat.Warum machen wir das?|bin seit fast 7 jahren mit meinem albanischen bad boy zs und hab 2 wundervolle töchter ... klar ... er ist anstrengend 🙄 aber sooooo ein bullshit das klischee bad boys schlagen ihre frauen ... er trägt mich auf händen 🤲🏼 ich nenn' jetzt mal einen geilen vorteil eines bad boys: KEINER, aber wirklich KEINER traut sich euch dumm anzumachen, geschweige denn in eure nähe ... weil jeder aus eurer city weis, dass gibt eine aufs' maul 😏♡|Badboys bzw Fuckboys sind eklig, allein schon deswegen dass die sich stolz Frauen nehmen die von anderen durchgebumst worden sind, anstatt sauber zu bleiben und darauf zu achten was man fickt.|Badboys sind eklig nicht nur weil die rumficken sondern auch weil die nicht nur eine Frau lieben können und nur eine Frau ehren können, die brauchen Abwechslung weil die schon immer andere Frauen hatten und es bei denen nicht mehr nur mit eine geht|Ich finde es gibt gar keine Vorteile bei Fuckboys, die meinen Spass zu haben weil die Frauen als Spielzeuge benutzten und Spass daran haben mit dene zu spielen aber was ist schon Spass wenn du danach Karma dafür kriegst ?|Bad boy 4 life👊🏽|Schreibst du auch irgendwann Mal ein Buch? Das wäre so gut.... Würde ich sofort kaufen :)|Ein Bad Boy hat meiner Meinung nach hohe Anerkennung und Respekt von vielen er hat sich ein Namen aufgebaut was viele Frauen auch mögen denn wir wollen einen der was erreicht!Wir können es nicht abhaben wen der uns im Wege steht und wir ihm immer aufhelfen müssen da er ja Eig der Mann ist und der “starke” sein muss (Old School denken bei mir muss ein Mann der stärkere sein)sei es bei Geld , sozialen stand und das leben ,doch er hat ein guten wie auch ein schlechten Ruf das es spannend macht zu wissen wer er ist. Dazu weckt es den jagt Instinkt bei Frauen auf denn wir wollen keinen Typen den wir in 5 min bekommen. Ein Bad Boy siegt meistens mit seinen Charme er ist gefährlich aber man fühlt sich sicher bei ihm|Ich hatte das mit dem JA Sager kommentiert 😂😂😂😂|Ein Bad Boy sieht zu 90% gut aus und wird Dir auch zu 90% das Herz brechen|Echt witzig all das hier zu lesen 😂🔥! Aber definiert doch bitte mal den typischen Badboy 😂😂 !!|@cxvmxx Hahahahah Badboy badboy|Fuckboy Bad boy (noch Ehemann) ein narzist, ich hasse ihn.|@der_bene_ weck mich auf wenn weiber im echten leben n jurastudierenden badboy wollen und nicht den dummen shishabar kanacken haha alles lügen|Ich denke alles muss wie bei einer Waage ausgeglichen sein . Ein Mann sollte die Frau respektieren und eine Frau den Mann auch. Man sollte sich ergänzen dass die Waage ich sag mal in Gleichklang kommt . Man sollte treu und loyal sein das macht jemanden interessant denke ich,also Wenn  man merkt dass dieser Mensch und du sich verstehen und mit einander klar kommen. Man sollte für einander kämpfen aber beide nicht nur einer wie gesagt komme ich wieder auf die Waage zurück. Alles sollte in jeder Beziehung, egal ob Freundschaft liebe oder anderes, im Gleichklang und positiven sein. Love u jennyyy😘😘|Frauen wollen den harten Kerl nach außen aber zu Hause Zucker und hoffen DER badboy der grad am Start könnte so sein.

The introductory session focused on understanding the difference between sex and gender, the process of gendering and how patriarchy affects our lives. The session was interactive with many staff members sharing their perspectives and opinions.

I worked with a counselor for 8 months and we started by talking about my experience. Over time I would slowly start engaging in conversations about trauma and sexual assault. It first started with just saying out loud that I was sexually assaulted too (which is very hard for most people) but over time I would add more details in and I'm now able to talk about it openly with others. I feel for myself personally my final stages of healing was to be able to use what happened to me, to help other people out there. I ever got triggered or upset i would excuse myself for a couple moments and take a breather. Unfortunately this is something that happens daily, but there is so many people out there who need to talk about this to be able to heal and for other people to understand - I know I did.|I just tell myself that it's better if we talk about it because our voices our louder than we think and silence never made it stop",46

THEN DON'T!|then watch Birds of Prey instead when that movie comes out 🤷‍♀️|Oh my fucking god he’s just a comic book character, and one of the most well written ones. It’s just a fictional story and if you can’t appreciate it dark elements in fiction and expect every story to be sunshine and rainbows then fine, live in your own world. Literally nobody said it was a relatable story and that his backstory completely validates everything else he does. It sure explains it though.|Watch something else. This is a tragic character piece about one of DC’s most evil villains. The DC universe is far far darker than other comic books and that is reflected in this movie. I mean come on the Joker in the comics skins a man alive and makes him pole dance for his amusement. It’s a really dark story. And from what I’ve read the movie is very explicit about not encouraging this type of behavior or glorifying it.|This is why no one likes feminists|I find this to be full of interesting talking points, however I don't think it exactly holds up. This specific character and his background have been around for ages. ""Everyone is just one bad day away"" is the entire premise of the killing joke and was a prevalent motive behind the jokers madness long before any of the Elliot Rogers/Incel movement stuff really came to light. It's likely people have been drawing inspiration from this character for decades, but i doubt it. Some deranged people find him relatable sure, but the majority of us fans have been begging for an origin story movie for ages and I'm actually kinda hyped. But I also recognize it's just a character so idk.|Again. Not an aesthetic text post. And it’s a comic book character. Get the fuck over yourselves my god.|Joker is at his best when Batman proves that trauma and mental illness aren’t an excuse for his actions like in The Killing Joke|So don’t watch it|I mean if he gets defeated that's lit|'white boys'|I feel like this misubderstands a lot of nuance to the joker. He's NOT relatable, the whole point is to illustrate the depths of depravity when the proverbial soul corrupts. He's not justified or glorious. He IS enigmatic and a deeply tragic character. I'd call him tragic precisely BECAUSE he's completely unjustified and unrelatable. And the rapist aspect was pretty shoe horned into the shitty killing joke adaptation-- that was NOT explicitly stated in the killing joke comic and the unsettling part of his actions is in their vagueness. The joker is one if DCs most enigmatic characters and he's not losing popularity. He's not supposed to be sympathetic or relatable,  hes supposed to be more a force of nature than a man by the time he is The Joker...|@fembotmag You’re dramatic AF! Just don’t watch the movie!!!|It's just a movie. It's not like everybody with cancer starts selling meth.#butthurt|@bullseyeben19 it’s true though...|I love the joker and I’ll be watching the movie. He’s an amazing character and tho I don’t agree with his methods I think he makes a wonderful underdog/horrible villain and portrays the fact that if no one else will do shit take it into your own hands. Again, I don’t agree with what he does but I think he is a wonderful and classic character that deserves some love and to have his story told. It’s called fiction.|🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌|Why is this hashtagged aesthetictextposts, how do I keep following the # I like without getting this type of shit in my feed|Black people cant relate to this? Only white boys? I feel like stats would prove otherwise.. but if you don’t blame white people you don’t get likes these days|So don’t watch it|JOKER IS COMINGGGG 🤡🤡🤡|“That nasty Batman” 😂😂...whoever wrote this is a gigantic tool bag. It’s a movie, I feel it ironic to have everyone say “movies and video games aren’t a problem for kids” then be like “man those movies and video games really give reasons to kill people” as a liberal, this shit has gotten soooooo lame|So run away from the truth for the rest of your life and next time when someone does something like mass shooting don’t ever ask “why”|that’s his character though, the point is that this stuff DOESNT excuse his actions|@fembot with another great feminist point of view!!!! 🤩👏 🤩 👏🤩 👏|He’s.... a fictional character|this !!!!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏|PREACH. Lord.|Tbh I really want a female joker who went mad from random men on he street telling her to smile🤷‍♀️|hey, guess what? joker was painted like this in the comics. it’s like y’all are trying to find something to blame for all the bad shit that goes on in the world.  bad shit happens not because of movies or other outside material.|Batman will still beat the crap out of him!!|Oh boo hoo. Cry me a mf river|Don’t watch the movie then 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡|This is something I've thought about with some films that come out about someone going on a violent spree for whatever the reason may be. How many people out there would see themselves in someone like the Joker and actually try to embody them in real life enough to do the heinous things they do in fiction? I get that the Joker is a fictional character and we have an expectation that most people won't, but... I dunno.

Mine is buying a villa in Spain, so I can spend 9 months there and 3 months in Montreal each year 🙈✨|Can't wait to follow along! 💛|Look forward to your stories. I loved my honeymoon trip to LA. Want to go again. 
We are about to expand our micro bakery and go out to a larger unit - so wish us luck that the next stage falls in place. Lance my husband who bakes all our delicious nutritious sourdoughs then had the unfortunate back health issue and is just recovering from a spine surgery. It’s been a challenging time but now I want to focus and take this business to the next step. A new bakery, train baker or two and establishing a small cafe where you can buy some breads but also taste it with some great coffee. 
Is that too big a dream? After going through the harder days with Lance’s health etc now I don’t think so anymore. 
So thanks for inspiring and reminding me of what we are truly capable of. I’m ready 🙌🏽👍🏼😆|All the best lovely lady! 🙌🏽💚 Go get that money 💰💯 💪🏼|Hope you have an amazing time!! 💗|Have a great time.

1353,157,"I wanted to let you know about some really exciting news.
_
As you know I’m very passionate about promoting and supporting females in tech.
_
That started with me posting on Instagram, and evolved into launching the FIIT Collective brand and website. Well, I’m super excited to be launching a podcast - the Females in Tech Show - on the 14th September!
_
I’ve really enjoyed the experience of creating the podcast, and more importantly, the opportunity to create new content to support the females in tech community.
_
The podcast will cover 3 key areas - Technology, Wellbeing and Balance - with the intention to support and empower females to live a balanced and purposeful life through a career in information technology.
_
The show will be launching with not one, but four episodes! I wanted to provide some variety upfront, to help kick start the show and encourage people to subscribe.
_
I’m also giving away a pair of Apple AirPods to celebrate the launch of the podcast. Keep an eye out for more details next week.
_
Also wanted to give a big shout out to the fabulous @lindaashby who has done an amazing job on my branding and logo design. If you’re looking for designer I highly recommend her!

1355,159,"Today, we had the pleasure of speaking with women from the Centro Communitario Palabras de Esperanza (“Community center words of Hope”). This center provides free medical services, education classes, sewing classes and youth programs.

Natasha and Zina led the group of women through relaxation techniques incorporating breathing exercises and essential oils to reduce stress.

In Puerto Penasco it’s consistently over a 100 degrees, it’s easy to overheat and become fatigued. One of the oils we used today was peppermint which is incredibly cooling and energizing for the body.

Who are you speaking too?|@tasmiyahhaff|👏|Facts💊|The entirety of the issue should be discussed in order to find real solutions. Women are capable of rape and men should be believed and taken seriously when those experiences are discussed.

Men can get raped, but if you use the statement to silence and oppress women you are not just disrespecting female rape victims you’re disrespecting male rape victims.|I’ve haven’t heard any stories of men or boys being raped while walking home, in a parking garage , or at a party? Are they just more quiet about it or is it that woman ARE largely targeted and attacked more than males are? Explain that.|All rape survivors deserve help after something so terrible!

1360,164,"The fastest growing demographics in #vanlife are People of Color. Yet POCs are underrepresented in the vanlife community!
~ ""Vanlife is a PRIVILEGE! There, I said it.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To make a choice, you must have a choice. And it’s a privilege to choose your lifestyle. Many of us vanlifers are #DigitalNomads with access to remote work. We have the freedom to go anywhere we choose, and we can afford the cost of fuel to get there. The freedom to travel gives us many options. We can purchase healthy food from co-ops, farmers’ markets, and niche markets as we travel. We can choose to only eat organic, non-gmo, gluten-free, vegan, pasture-raised. Planet Fitness gym memberships give us access to showers, wifi and treadmills. We have the flexibility to explore our hobbies and pursue our passions uninhibited.
We’re not being policed on public lands or arrested in laundromat parking lots (most of us, anyway). But let’s be honest, that’s because #vanlife is primarily white, and becoming more gentrified every day. And the constant glamorization is driving that more and more.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Don’t get me wrong, I love me some pasture-raised eggs. And I’m also guilty of glamorizing this lifestyle, with my birthday ass-shots and all.
But let’s be real, what are we doing to create a space for underrepresented voices in this growing community? I’ve been to many gatherings & meetups this year where I was one of, if not the only, person of color. Am I the only person of color in vanlife?
Hell no! We out here.
So, why aren’t we hearing more from the marginalized individuals in this community? Why is it only the privileged stories we read about on here? What are the privileged many doing to make this lifestyle safe and accessible for ALL members of our community?
Mmmhmm. Shit’s gotta change y’all. And STOP getting offended by the word “privilege.” Cause y’all mofo’s are PRIVILEGED.
Anyway, just me thinking out loud. Y’all will be hearing more from me on this again soon."" - Noami from @irietoaurora",yesallwomen,"|#diversifyvanlife #brownvanlife #blackvanlife #vanlifecommunitymatters #vanlifecommunityisusall #yesallwomen #speakyourtruth #useyourvoice #POCvanlife #protectourpubliclands #keeppubliclandspublic #optoutside #votetheoutdoors #protectourlands #vanlifers #vanlifemagazine #publiclandsproud #gooutdoorsy  #outboundliving #outdoorcommunity #offgrid #bepartofthesolution #nomadiclife #projectvanlife  #keepyourbackyardclean #homeiswhereyouparkit  #campmoreworkless|We hear you @irietoaurora and were here to support you! #diversifyvanlife|#brownvanlife😎✌🏽|@therealdcmayor|Awesome!

Those of us driving a 20 year old van with the seats ripped out and everything homemade and repurposed because we're too poor to afford to live in a house...now that's van life.|I hear what you are saying and support you and anyone that wants to live creatively. I can tell you that here in the bay area, a lot of vanlifers are doing this because they can’t afford housing. I have a brick and mortar job and can’t stomach the rents so I don’t fit with you beautiful glamorous nomads out there. My privilege is that I am less likely to be harassed or questioned because I am white, young looking, and female.

What the heck?|Yes!!!! Finally!! Representation is so important. I am so excited to see more POC folks being celebrated in this space! Please keep featuring POC folks, the outdoors is a space for all. 
#POCvanlife|This is such a great point you make. I have been privileged and then not so privileged in life in general. I know when I started my travels and venturing (with my x) It was interesting to see peoples reaction. Plus he had lots of tattoos but we did find a job as camp hosts for 6 months. I am looking to return to van life with my dogs now lol and am so excited to do so. I have been to many other states and areas and know what it is like to be a poc in a predominately  anglo place. My mom's famous words were ""The best revenge is success"" so I live by that. And if I feel an inclining of being judged for my brown color then I will not support that company, business, person etc. I just bought a 2002 Ford 150 econoline that I am trying to do a basic build on. I just couldn't get caught up in feeling like I needed to keep up and go buy that Promaster or Sprinter at this point. I'm 61 yrs old and so ready to hit the road after the past 3 yrs of a lot of loss. Thanks for sharing. I was supposed to go to your Van meetup earlier this summer but got sick. Hopefully next time.|yes!!! I love that you’re calling out privilege, probably the first person I’ve seen to do so. It isn’t a “scary” word, it’s reality and it’s our duty as a privileged van lifers to identify and address it. Would love to see more representation of POC and LGBTQ+ van lifers, thank you for shaking up the status quo.",713

1364,168,"What makes you feel vulnerable? For me, it’s talking.👇🏻⁣
⁣
Talking in front of large groups, to people I look up to, or have placed a lot of importance upon makes me feel vulnerable. I don’t want to let them down. I don’t want to forget their names. I worry they’ll dislike me. And I worry they’ll be mean...⁣
⁣
But talking has set me free far more times than keeping quiet ever has. Talking has been the only thing that’s led me to overcome anxieties, make loved ones proud, and been a catalyst for people enjoying my company and wanting to see me again. It’s something that has also led to me being called so many lovely words throughout my life.⁣
⁣
Facing the thing that makes us feel vulnerable is often exactly what we need to grow. And grow we shall 🌿⁣

1371,175,"This landmark text introduces readers to the field of women's studies by analyzing the contradictions between social and cultural ""givens"" and the realities that women face in society. Written collectively by nine authors from various disciplines, Women's Realities, Women's Choices, Fourth Edition, has been updated to incorporate the latest research and statistics in the field. Covering the most recent developments in politics, labor, family life, religion, and culture, the book also features extensive research on relevant social issues, such as the impact of the post Soviet world on women's lives, the experience of homosexuality in family life, and the effects of economic globalization on women worldwide. Examining women as individuals, as family members, and as a force in the greater social fabric, Women's Realities, Women's Choices remains the most timely, comprehensive, and compelling introduction to the field of women's studies. •

So I'm taking time today to recognize some of the AMAZING #womeninfilm for female directors month, because they're blazing trails and setting examples and deserve a round of applause.

Yes I love a bachie debrief before heading into an important meeting 😏 I’m tired of the stigma that surrounds women’s interests and hobbies. We are made to feel embarrassed and unintelligent when we sit around discussing fashion trends or celebrity gossip or god forbid singing along to a Taylor Swift song. We suppress and avoid these topics in the presence of men in order not to sound ‘shallow and ditzy’ and I’ve had it!!! The two are not mutually exclusive - so next time a man unwantedly chimes in, turn up that T-Swift in his face cos #hatersgonnahate 👊🏼 Img via @thegirlslikeme",yesallwomen,"|.

1390,194,"A part of me is feeling vulnerable and scared the other angry and determined to make a change.
_
In my 32 years I have never felt afraid in my beloved South Africa. Through all the hideous an heinous things that happen I have always chosen to find the positive to look on the bright side to believe that I am always protected. My brother always tells me I live in a bubble, these past few weeks is the first time that I am beginning to think he is right.
_
These past few weeks have shocked me and shaken me awake, its stirred something deep in me, a mixture of emotion that I am still trying to figure out. But when I read stats like Men kill women every 4 hours in South Africa, 109 rapes are recorded on average everyday!!! It makes me sick to my stomach.
_
I’m not only worried about myself but for all the women I love and all the women I don’t even know, my heart hurts for us and the way we have to live in absolute fear every single day. It’s not good enough anymore to watch what you wear or where you go and what times, not that we should ever have to think about those things ever but at least then I felt ok I felt like maybe just maybe I have some of the power I have some control.
_
What’s been going on in the past few weeks is madness, its senseless and I’ve had enough!!!
There is a march happening at parliament in Cape Town tomorrow from 10:30am I am not able to attend for reasons that are not in my control but I will be there in spirit and I am determined to use my voice, my influence to make a change.
Lets use our voices for those who no longer have their own, their souls were taken and ignited this change lets not let it be in vain.",yesallwomen,"|.

Beautiful message💖|Hopefully there are still enough good men out there, to weigh in the balance ... all the others deserve to be treated like they treat others, sorry , sometimes eye for eye is what you need to realize, even though it’s not the “political” thing to say.|This was exactly how I used to feel, I always believed that I would be safe and able to protect myself even though we hear about what goes on everyday. I've always been extremely cautious but to an extent. This has all changed in such a short period of time. Now I wake up thinking about my day ahead and how what should be a simple task of driving out of the driveway feels daunting, how I start praying when I approach a traffic light, how I become jittery when I see men walk by, or how I hold onto my panic button at other times. This is wrong and I am confident that there are thousands of South African women who feel exactly the same. We should never have any of these fears, how do we continue our day by day tasks when just being present is absolutely scary. We do not deserve to live like this!!!|Looking beautiful❤️❤️|This a beautiful capture. Your post made me well-up. I understand the sentiment as my island home is not what it once was.

Being a mirror to their toxic behavior sometimes is the only way they see|Hang them by their balls until blood rushes into those empty brains and gets them thinking with their mind instead of their dicks for once.|Feminism is EQUAL RIGHTS. Not putting men lower than us but to be equal .|The word feminism has been twisted and torn from equality of the sexes to man hating hyperbole. It's not a four letter word. Propoganda takes key words and uses them on the media and social media to turn us against each other. No man is my master. We are not the enemy.|By showing them in a nonthreatening way.|Maybe don't be a dick about spreading your beliefs|We stop trying to convince them of anything. 👏🏻 Just own it and put things right and they will see it with their own eyes|We stop trying to convince them of anything. 👏🏻 Just own it and put things right and they will see it with their own eyes|Why tf am I following this page i never fucking heard of this shit|You can’t do anything with someone not open to learning or thinking they already know everything|Changing the name and core beleifs|Idk , try convincing the "" feminist "" first?|Male birth control|that we support men’s issues too. or that feminism helps and supports people who have been faced with injustice and that should be enough but i guess it’s not|How ab you change the core beliefs- actual 50-50 equality. And stop acting like if one guy is an incel online that “so many men in the western word are still sexists” in the western world you have it equal. If anything you should also be working on men’s rights to see their children, not lose half their shit on divorce, and not have their consentually made child aborted without their knowledge|maybe we should try convincing the misandrists disguised as feminists first|You make other men do it.|Call it equalism instead 😂🤷|Show them how the system affects them negatively too. Point out the ways Toxic Masculinity takes away from their lives. Feminism is about everyone.|It’s a trick question, we don’t. just stop trying to live for men and live for ourselves and each other 💜|Fight for shot that’s real not equal pay in sports when y’all are about 20% as capable. The girls soccer team lost to high school boys and wants equal pay. They generated 1/32 the revenue but want equal pay? If the job was equal they’d be in the same league.|Send them to contrapoints video titled 'men'|Why do we need to convince the men? Isn’t that we have been tried for ever? We can use our energy for more important things.|Teach boys, and all kids no matter their gender, how to be good people. No quick solution because many men like their privilege and are willing to pay the cost of toxic masculinity if it keeps their entitlement going feeds their delusion of superiority.  But at least there are many men already smart enough to be feminists.|Dont make a ""pussy chunch"" if your wondering what im talking about look up shoeonhead pussy church on youtube you will find her video about it|equalism? idk but i think the name is probably part of it|You can’t fix stupid, but I think the biggest thing is the name itself. It sounds like it only cares about the rights of women.|We don't. I say we do our own thing and let them figure it out. I'm not here to convince anyone because you wind up wasting a lot of your time and energy wrongly. Nope, we keep walking, speaking up and out. There are those who will see and understand and those who won't.|Let’s start by not trying to explain or convince men of our oppression. Let’s start there.|Women give birth to & raise both sexes. Supporting women, especially mothers, is vitally important to both sexes. To mistreat & devalue a mother is to abuse her son as well as her daughter. Plus sexual freedom is the highest natural pleasure—it makes sex better when it’s tender & loving & free! Women are the better half of humanity. There are good men but many are ego-driven selfish & dominating. Women nurture & care. There’s bad amount both sexes but we can see where we are with men in charge —war destruction abuse genocides rape economic disparity. The world needs women’s women to have equal seats at the table.|@shake_handz|Don't try to convincemen. Instead, remember that we raise men. It starts with us. Raise our boys to be respectful, loving men, who treat women equally and underatand our struggles.|Stop calling it feminism and call it equality 🤷🏼‍♂️|Include men in the cause|Feminism isn’t for them. It might benefit men, it might be ethical for them to support it, and we can build coalitions. But it isn’t about them. Just like white people gotta be the ones talking to other white people about racism. It’s up to allies to use their/our privileges to educate others in their/our respective groups. Just like as a non-Black person, I shouldn’t need convincing to support justice for Black people, nor should I speak on their behalf. I can challenge anti-Blackness, check myself, and support however I can without taking up space in THEIR movement. The work of an ally is more internal and less public. Movements need genuine solidarity to succeed, not assimilation.|Actually make it about equality. Women have more rights then men. Make them equal, and then we’ll talk|Or “how do we convince men that women are people too?”|Feminism is for women + enbys (imo). Dismantling the patriarchy might help men, but it's goal isn't to advance the rights of a group that's already on top. Sorry not sorry.|By not saying “I hate men”????|Feminism is to empower everybody maybe people shouldn’t be so goddamn exclusive not to mention yeah maybe men started this shit but guess who didn’t stop it, WOMEN we gotta riot make our voices heard so things society can’t ignore and most importantly show love to our enemies like Dr. King said don’t fight hate with hate fight it with love|Feminism is the only movement where the people doing the most work can't centre themselves 😴|It’s not our job to. They can figure it out on their own while we dismantle the mess they created|Give me Toyota or give me death|I've been having discussions with the men in my life about how the patriarchy is negatively impacting them via toxic masculinity and other ridiculous stereotypes i.e. men can't cry, men can't be raped, men have to work themselves to death to financially support a wife and a large family, men shouldn't be stay at home parents etc.|I don't try to convince them. People should support justice, even if they don't think it impacts them. I don't support indigenous justice because it helps me-- it's about doing the right thing for others. I feel like ""feminism is for men too!"" Is often kind of pandering to men who argue in bad faith. Dudes who respect justice and equity don't need an explanation of their benefits package-- they do the right thing because they have ethics.|How do we convince people* that feminism is for everyone..?|Feminism no longer stands for what it once did. It has become a twisted ideology that promotes misandry and warped Identity politics over equality for all. This is why so many women I know have turned from feminism.|I'm already convinced that women have equal if not more rights|Talk to them. Not at them.|Show us your boobs as you say it, trust me every straight men will agree|Why convince them? If they don't already think so then they aren't worthwhile. Oppressed communities don't gain rights via convincing, they do so by putting pressure on the systems in place to change their material conditions. Men don't have to think feminism is for them to do that.|i want to set example for my fellows. i'm trans and i lived most of my life ""treated"" as a girl. and that changes your perspective. you see what feminism is and how it helps everyone|Convince men?  I know women who are against this ideology 😂|First, clearly define what feminism is.
Second, make a clear argument on why it’s beneficial to women and not harmful to men.
Third, set guidelines that are not double standard.
Fourth, if they’re good, get all women to by off on the defined set of guidelines, and not change them out of convenience|Don’t force people into ideologies; be understanding of men’s issues; present a clear argument; define feminism and don’t shame people who aren’t feminists but still agree with the concept of equal rights.|Why are we so hellbent on sucking shadow dicks? Feminism is NOT for men. Feminism exists ONLY to liberate marginalized genders and abolish patriarchy. God why does everything revolve around god damned men??|I honestly don’t think we should waste any energy trying to convince people who are committed to not understanding. Privilege is a hard power to give up. Power never concedes itself. Better to accept it, and focus energy on changing laws and improving access to opportunity, and just do the work.|Remind ourselves that it is not all men|Men shouldn't need to think feminism is about everyone to care about it. They need some empathy|Wait that’s Emma Watson tho?|How many men does it take to change the toilet roll, none because we've never tried it",1870

Brands care about profit and they will only be a handful brave enough to jump on this. Brand purpose has died.|@anica_myburgh @zulke_krouwkam @iam_zulke|@bakedonline @nadiajaftha",374

1422,226,"Snacks are stocked, board games are on deck, candles are ready to light, and much of Florida is hunkering down as we guess which way this hurricane goes. But what we don’t always notice are those still working overtime, anxiously waiting to see what type of impact and cleanup it will have on business.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Work has to continue as normal (as possible) for some of us through the uncertainty, the confusion, and the heavy hearts for those in the path of this catastrophic storm. In times like this, it can be hard to put our personal needs over our professional ones — especially if our job has to continue on.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
This is your reminder to take care of yourself first and say no if needed. Work will always be there, but our personal lives can be easily taken for granted. As we keep both those in the path and those that have to work through the storm in our thoughts, remember to take the time to be near those you love, and take a deep breath. You deserve it. —Morgan #babeswhohustle⁠⠀",yesallwomen,"|.⁣⠀

1428,232,"Found this amazing blog! Please read it ! Share it with friends . I write this blog with an extremely heavy heart . And I’m sad that my first post blog after being gone for so long is about something so heart wrenching. Today headlines sent shockwaves through South Africa as it come to light that 19 years old UCT student Unyinene Mrwetyana was taped and murdered by a 42 years old man. It’s sickness to know that we live in a world filled with horrendous people like this man that raped and murdered Nene. I am shocked, I am heartbroken but most of all I am angry.!!!! I am angry because Nene went to the post office to find out about a parcel she was expecting and instead she was raped and then murdered. I am angry that an activity that is supposed to be simple normal and safe turned out to be the last thing Nene ever did. I am angry that it was broad daylight!!! I’m angry that as a woman we are told is not safe to be alone in the night , but now it’s seems it’s not safe to be alone in the daylight either. I’m angry that some men think women are objects that they can use abuse and discard when they’re finish. I am angry that this man gets to live but Nene doesn’t. I am angry that I have to text my friends asking them if they r home safe. I am angry that as a woman we’ ve lost  our sense of normality because of sick people in this world . #nomore #fightforourlives #noviolenceagainstwomen #fightforourright #metoo #timesup #believewomen #nomoore #yesallwomen #dontforget #",yesallwomen,"|😞|Sono senza parole credimi , una ragazza bellissima,  R.I.P❤️|#endviolenceagainstwomen #betterworld #protectgirls #safer #southafricangirls #|Che tristezza 😢|Sembra davvero molto interessante e originale👍|Nessun posto è sicuro purtroppo..|È straziante il fatto di dover vivere in un mondo dove da nessuna parte sei al sicuro, purtroppo l'unica strada che possiamo usare è la legge che spesso neanche funziona|Non ci sono parole😢|😢|Sinceramente non ho parole 🥺|Non ho parole.. davvero straziante|Che tristezza che mondo davvero crudele 🙈|Il.

You must have enough self discipline to be able to overcome these things and you must really want it. 
If you are depressed or bored with your life it is time you start living out your true passion 🌟 
You can learn many things but the biggest benefits are how to be happy by removing barriers and living a wonderful life...♥️ It is entirely up to you and there are many things you can focus on to help you become successful.

1449,253,"Over the past couple of weeks I’ve been hearing SO many stories of women not supporting women. It’s happening to my friends. It’s happening in my local and online community. And it just makes me so sad.⁣
⁣
Women bitching about other women.⁣
Women publicly slating other women.⁣
Women deliberately sabotaging other women.⁣
Women competing with other women.⁣
Women body shaming other women.⁣
⁣
In the words of T-Swift: “you need to just stop. Like can you just not???” 🙅🏼‍♀️⁣
⁣
Ladies, we’ve got enough battles going on without turning on each other! 🤦🏼‍♀️⁣
⁣
✨ There’s enough room for all of us.⁣
✨ We shine brighter together.⁣
✨ Helping another woman to shine just makes you shine brighter.⁣
✨ Support other women even if they do the same thing as you; your lights are completely different and unique. ⁣
✨ Be delighted when another woman succeeds.⁣
✨ Cheerlead the hell out of everyone. 🎉⁣
⁣
Fancy helping me doing some cheerleading today? Tag another Wonder Woman in the comments below and celebrate the hell out of her! 🥳 The more the merrier! ⁣
⁣
WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN 👊🏼⁣

“The women I love and admire for their strength and grace did not get that way because shit worked out. They got that way because shit went wrong and they handled it. They handled it a thousand different ways on a thousand different days, but they handled it. Those women are my superheroes.” - Elizabeth Gilbert.

1477,281,"I don't agree. All people are beautiful in their own way, BUT the person who believes in themselves is a different kind of beautiful that is awe-inspiring!⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I tend to gravitate more toward people who are actively doing big things in their life. Because I *know* those people believe in themselves. That energy is contagious and I feed on it for my own journey when I need motivation.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
In a world filled with so much fear and hate, it can be challenging to find sources of belief and good. Girls on the Run is a nonprofit organization that helps girls believe in their limitless potential and go after their dreams when so much of the world says ""you can't.""⁠⠀
⁠⠀
That's why I am fundraising for Girls on the Run by running the Tartarus Backyard Ultra at the end of September.⁠⠀

In the Girls on the Run program running is used to inspire and motivate girls, encourage lifelong health and fitness, and build confidence through accomplishment. Important social, psychological, and physical skills and abilities are developed and reinforced throughout the program. At each season's conclusion, the girls and their running buddies complete a 5K running event which gives them a tangible sense of achievement as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals. The result—making the seemingly impossible, possible, and teaching girls that THEY CAN.⁠⠀

Maybe it's about being a woman in her truth, fighting for her cause, her dreams, her vision and doing it exactly as she sees fit."" ― Scarlett Curtis - -

This is one of the most important books I've ever read, enlightening me and thousands of other girls to be strong female leaders in our world. - -

1480,284,"Happy #NewMoon! 🌚 This moon traditionally corresponded to menstruation pre-artificial lighting days. It was a time of deep wisdom and bleeding, two very scary things for the patriarchy. That honor, nobility, respect was taken away. This new moon is a chance to honor yourself, the women who got you here, and the ones who will come next, by taking your power back.
❣️
Menstruating or not, take time for yourself, judgement free, and breathe. Take space for yourself. Light a candle 🕯 or stare at the stars ✨ or write down what you’d like to see happen this moon month, or all three!

1482,286,"Preferences for white partners stem from the notion that whites dominate the racial hierarchy. This isn’t surprising once you consider the centuries of colonialism and white centered justice systems and its effects. These events have influenced what the Asian community considers to be successful. Such standards of success translate to their perceptions of what it means to be an adequate partner. While Asian parents think they’re looking out for you, they’re also reinforcing bigotry. This is evidence of prejudice against other people of color in the Asian community, specifically anti-blackness. #linkinbio by @banhwow
