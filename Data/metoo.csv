1,"Cuba Gooding Jr.’s case is not looking so good.

Cuba Gooding Jr.’s sexual misconduct trial has grown substantially since he was first accused of groping a woman a New York bar back in June. When the Snow Dogs actor headed to trial last week for the charge, he was told that a new charge against his name had been documented and he would have to re-schedule his trail to a later date.

The folks over at Page Six have now gotten word of the new charge that brings Cuba’s accuser count to 14. According to the publication, the latest accuser is bringing to light an incident that happened in February of 2017 with the actor allegedly grabbed her arm at a Los Angeles bar and told her to sit on his face and pee in her mouth. Cuba said the latter after he put his hand in her blouse and squeezed her breast. Cuba was reportedly told to leave the woman but persisted.

Other allegations against Cuba include a time he grabbed a woman’s butt at the Chatwal Hotel in Manhattan in 2013, reached under a woman’s skirt in 2014 at Cafe Havana in Malibu and similar inappropriate incidents throughout New York, California, Texas and New Mexico. “We are completely confident that there will be no criminal conviction of Cuba Gooding Jr. [The actor] is certainly innocent of the allegations that will be presented today before the court and we’re going to ask that the court send this case out today for trial,” Mark said, as seen in the video in the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com Thoughts? #cuba #cubagoodingjr #boyzinthehood #boyznthehood #fightingtheair #rkelly #robertkelly #survivingrkelly #metoo",metoo,"|💀💀💀💀😅|Radio ,what you doing?!

3,"🖤 This is me, the real me – but it wasn’t until recently that I have been comfortable to show the real me again.
To some, this darker - more revealing side of me might have been a big surprise because not too long ago I was that cute pastel girl. Not too long ago I wasn’t really all that happy either. I’ve struggled a lot to find the right balance of the things I like, my true style, my sexuality, my purpose as an artist and how I wanted to translate all of that to real life.

Growing up being active in the performing arts field, my role-models (and crushes) were @sarahmgellar (a vampire slayer), @milano_alyssa (a charmed witch) and Angelina Jolie (the videogame hero and basically just the most bad ass woman ever walking this earth. Period.) As a teen I wanted to be them.

Luckily as I have always been in the creative field, I never had strict dress codes to live up to. Yet, the past decade I had started to hold back when it comes to my true style.
Due to a traumatic MeToo experience in the music industry, followed by an accident a few years later that not only kept me from pursuing my dreams for years and years because of the chronic illness it caused me – I lost my confidence and my true self all together. 
I believe style - whether this is expressed in clothing, accessories, tattoos or piercings - is the ultimate form of self-expression and contributes to my aesthetic and creativity.
Now that I am who I truly want to be, I no longer feel afraid to embrace my individuality and reflect my personality through my style. 
Of course I am not walking around on the streets wearing a bralette – I do however want to make a statement with this picture.
I am me again, the slayer, the witch, the videogame hero and the woman who went through hell and back in real life but came out stronger than ever before.
I am proud of the woman I have become. I am proud of the body that holds my soul.

I wear what makes me feel confident. I’ll show some skin if I want to. I am allowed to feel sexy for no reason really.
What I wear or how I look is no open invitation for men to take advantage of me. It's also no invitation for women to shame me. 🖤

She recalls how her life and all Iranian’s lives were changed by two major events that took place right after each other in Iran: the revolution of 1979, followed by eights years of the Iran-Iraq war. Most people’s values, goals and dreams for their future changed as the Islamic revolution changed cultural values in Iranian society. Then came the turbulence in her personal life in her late teenage years that made her flee the country over night in order to save her life. #7000milestofreedom #immigrant",metoo,"|.

14,"Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault/Violence

These are just a few of the many statistics surrounding the reality of sexual violence. Sexual violence has been swept under the rug for so long, but today I add my voice to the thousands of people trying to change that.

@nowthisher created a wonderful video outlining the differences between sexual assault and harassment, where they define sexual assault as “forced sexual contact, sexual behavior or attempts at either, done without consent.” And as passionate as I am, someone usually says it better than I can. “Rape is the only crime on the books for which arguing that the temptation to commit it was too clear and obvious to resist is treated as a defense. For every other crime, we call that a confession.” She was asking for it.

Look at how she was dressed.

She didn’t say no.

There’s a fairly common complaint among men that because of the #metoo movement, “now anything I do is considered harassment,” or “no one can take a joke anymore.” But if you care to take a look at the flip side, women have to constantly think about how they act and dress because we’re the ones being blamed for our assaults.

Don’t believe me? Ask a guy how he loads his groceries at night.

Now compare that answer, which was probably a blank stare, to my answer.

I have an entire system for leaving the grocery store at night. Where I park, how I hold my keys, looking under my car when I’m walking up to it, looking in the back seat before getting in, and immediately locking the doors when I get inside.

Do you know how amazing it would be to be able to go on a run at night with headphones in? Or workout in just a sports bra?

And I could go running at night with headphones, or workout in just a sports bra. But “you should’ve been more careful” is a more common response to an assault than “we’re going to find who did this to you.” If you think this is being blown out of proportion, I’ll leave you with Idris Elba’s comment on the difficulty of being a man because of #metoo “It’s only difficult if you’re a man with something to hide.” Statistics, information and additional resources can be found at the following sites tagged above.",metoo,|Fantastic read! I’m glad we can all start having a discussion about these difficult topics.|THIS. OH. MY. WORD. YES. THIS. I am erupting with emotions and feelings about this right now. I know victims of rape. Sexual assault. And it is NOT okay that they have been put on a back burner with no care or thought to bring justice to the men who did wrong. It’s AWFUL. I feel this post deeply. Well said.|👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Thank you for sharing!!! This is such a real issue and I love Idris’ words - 💗💗💗,4

It was at that moment that I forgave myself. On this day 11 years ago, I started my life over, but I never forgave myself. Why is that we can forgive others so easily but find it to hard to forgive ourselves?

17,"""I am a warrior!” Is something I tell myself consistently to remind myself of my strength and that no one will take power over me again.⁣
⁣
My name is Stephanie Silva and I have been sexually assaulted by a former boss of mine. After working as an Executive Assistant for just over 2 years I experienced something that I truly never thought would ever happen to me. It was the start of my career and I was dedicated, devoted and ambitious to be able to support one of the CEO’s and grow my career at a company.⁣
⁣
I remember feeling very grateful for the opportunity that had presented itself, but I was very scared that I’d fail especially since I had no former experience in the role and no post-secondary education. But, never in my life did I think I would have been manipulated the way I was and then taken advantage of. That is something no body can prepare for.⁣
⁣
It took 2 years for him to build trust with me and after he established that trust he exploited it. He knew my family, my relationship at the time, he knew everything about me. He made me feel like I could trust him as he would consistently tell me he cared about me and seen me like a daughter.⁣
⁣
It has now been 1 year and 9 months since it happened and through those tough times I met Mariam; who is the co-founder of @project_this.is.me and through sharing my story with her I realized she bares the same scars as I do. Although, her story is very different than mine, we both have shared the same struggles with the healing, acceptance and coming out and being able to talk about it whole heartedly.⁣
⁣
⁣
As I always tell myself “I’ll never let someone else take the light out of my life ever again!” The light is me. My happiness. My purpose. MY LIFE! I decide to take it back! We hope through Project: This Is Me we can help everyone take their light back.⁣
⁣
Thank you,⁣

22,"It’s time for an updated standard of healthy masculinity, that much is clear.

Unfortunately, a lot of men are simply scared in the wake of the #metoo movement and allow that fear to paralyze them instead of engaging in the conversation.

Not @jason__rosario, though.

He’s made it his mission to engage a new standard of masculinity that’s vulnerable and healing with his @yahoo exclusive show, Dear Men, and his company, The Lives of Men.

This week we did something different on the podcast and @mikejwatts sat down with Jason solo so they could talk just the two of them.

I listened in later and loved what I heard about:
.
-the surprising thing Jason recommends we share with our kids
-his key tip for co-parenting (which applies both to parents who are together and those who aren’t)
-how men can form more meaningful friendships
-how brands can stay relevant as our view or masculinity evolves
-and so much more

If you’re raising a man, living with a man, or love men (or, of course, are one) then this episode will give you a lot to chew on.

23,"Rp @jasonbolalek I often post about successful rescues with happy endings. These bull calves are prisoners, living in their own filth, that did not have a happy ending because they are merely byproduct. I have to share their stories, their faces, how they are treated,  because it hit me hard, because it is the truth and because it’s all done in silence and secrecy. I need to share the faces of the nameless calves that will end up in compost piles or will be stunned in order to be dismembered for veal. I need to share this, even though I could not save them,  because these babies deserve to have their stories told. I want to make people understand that it’s not “one bad farm” and that “local” or “free range” farms engage in these practices even though it’s not in plain sight. •

24,"Sexually abused as a child. Reborn like a phoenix rising from the ashes.⠀⁣⁣ ⁣
⁣
My name is Mariam Azimi; daughter, sister, aunt, friend, girlfriend, dog mama, mentor, fighter, warrior. THIS IS ME. This is what defines me. Having been sexually abused in my early years, it has affected my entire life, in ways I cannot explain but it will never define me.⠀⁣⁣ ⠀⁣⁣
⁣
Most will look at me and think ""she's so put together,"" but I've been battling my mind since I was 11 years old.⠀⁣⁣ ⠀⁣⁣
⁣
Having gone through this experience at such a young age, (while devastating), it forced me to find my inner strength early on and channel all the anger, sadness and fear through it. But on the flipside, I could never be the ""good girl,"" and truthfully speaking what was the point? I had already been violated. Before I even knew what certain parts of my body were for, they were already being used. Fearing that no one would believe me, I decided to bury this secret, a secret that would rob me of my entire childhood.⠀⁣⁣ ⠀⁣⁣
⁣
It wasn't until my late 20s (17 years later) that I came out with my story and it was then that I finally decided to start attacking my inner demons. Since then, it's been a journey and a beautiful one at that; filled with dark days where I've had a knife to my throat because the pain was just too unbearable to bright days where I'm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and my partner is telling me he loves me for the very first time.⠀⁣⁣ ⠀⁣⁣
⁣
The journey to healing is infinite and should be traveled through the darkest of days to the brightest. As co-founder of Project This Is Me, I want to use this platform to reach and empower those who have been through this horrid experience, to let them know they are not alone, to give them a voice and help them reach those bright days that seem so far out of reach. To the survivors who are currently struggling with their journey, you are not alone. Please dm me and we will conquer this battle together.⠀⁣⁣ ⠀⁣⁣

Love,⠀⁣⁣

35,"💎Y ahora piensa. Lo de cerrar los ojos lo dejo a tu libre albedrío. Si me permites el consejo, te diré que ayuda. Y mucho.
💎Piensa. En dónde estás y dónde te has visto. En si realmente quieres estar allí. El subconsciente tiene sus propias formas de hablarnos. Pero hay que dejarle. Y escucharle.
💎Piensa en lo que te falta para llegar si es a dónde quieres llegar. El cómo, el cuándo, el dónde. Algo tendrá cuando te ha venido a la mente, no lo dudes.
💎Piensa si vas por el buen camino, si te has torcido a propósito o te has dejado perder. Si te has parado a bailar o te has quedado en el bar del pueblo anterior. Hay  espejismos donde se vive muy bien. Cada uno elige. 🧚‍♀️Y ahora, cierra los ojos y dime…
Buenas noches 💞

FreeFrom works to create pathways to financial security and long-term safety that support survivors of gender-based violence. This summer, our Vice President of Programs Camille Emeagwali participated in a panel discussion at Me Too Fund grantee partner FreeFrom’s inaugural Survivor Wealth Summit. The groundbreaking two-day event explored the concept of survivor wealth and what is needed in communities and across various sectors to develop a deeper understanding of financial trauma and healing. Camille joined an all women of color panel of dynamic funders and thought leaders to discuss the importance of survivors of gender-based violence building wealth.

I went to Portugal last week and really started to think about the concept of REAL and AUTHENTIC love for our friends. Actions to your words. Honestly, sometimes a listening ear is the best thing you can give a warrior.
•
If you have a friend, significant other or family member who has been a victim of any type of abuse, especially sexual assault, please be authentic. The worst you can do is put ‘fake’ words or fake love and not back it up. Hear me out, it doesn’t have to elegant or put together just REAL. Survivors have already been betrayed by the assault itself but potentially by other people or by the justice system. If you say that you believe them, then my prayer is that you stand up for them in a situation. Don’t be another person, we all mess up but just be honest. Jesus will give us the true love, but we can try to love others the authentic way HE loves us.

55,"// ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰ in September (which is long ago at this point!), the sryimbooked club discussed Trick Mirror, a book of essays by Jia Tolentino. thanks are due to the friendly staff at @kramerbooks for helping me choose this pick for book club - it did not disappoint!
·
often while reading Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino, I'd look up after being engrossed in an essay to read a section aloud to my boyfriend sitting nearby, shaking my head and saying ""this is so true!!"" at book club this month, we had similar reactions as we discussed the diverse array of essay topics, in which Tolentino calls out points with striking relevance and relatability.
·
I wish these essays had been required reading in college; I needed the exposés on optimizing ourselves through sweetgreen salads and workout classes, on the complexity or lack thereof around reality TV, about the nuances and impact of #MeToo, and regarding the scams of our generation, to name a few. Tolentino can be scathing and pessimistic for being just thirty years old, but more often than not I found her opinions to be fresh, forward, and altogether compelling.

From EW: “The year’s best spy thriller is stranger — and more horrifying — than fiction. In Catch and Kill, Ronan Farrow expands on his reporting of the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein and others, while also telling his story of unraveling shocking conspiracies, from Hollywood to D.C. He weaves a breathless narrative as compelling as it is disturbing.” Farrow won the Pulitzer for his reporting on the #metoo movement; this may merit his next one.

#MeToo is more than workplace sexual harassment. It’s about gender-based and sexual violence and misconduct in our schools, male privilege and consent, and racialized and gendered dress codes. At its core, #MeToo is about dismantling and healing from power asymmetries.
.
Today is the anniversary of the #MeTooMovement, and not one presidential candidate has yet to discuss this issue as a part of their platform.
.
As I say, now is time to #bebossy. Now is time to demand recognition for our trauma, now is time to hold this patriarchal system accountable. One victim is too many.

Like hundreds of other (mostly) women, I too, want to shed light on my experiences, and my friends' experiences in their #abusiverelationship 's,  #narcissisticabuse , #toxic relationships , #mentalabuse with an emphasis on #mentalhealth. Most, if not ALL my posts are experiences I or close friends have experienced which is why I chose them. 
This is what inspired me to take action, the people I care about are continuously getting hurt (verbal, physical and even near-death situations). Last night,  10/15/19, a very close friend phoned me at 1am sharing some devastating news. Her SO choked her on the ground in front of her toddler and she couldn't breathe. Cops came, incident report was made... but for every complicated reason to be involved with a #narcissist / #sociopath / toxic SO, the truth could not be told. #Fear is what stopped her. This is why I created this page. No tolerance for this bullshit!

I know too many women dealing with this #unhealthyrelationships and little knowledge or encouragement to #HEAL and where to begin healing.

.
På 2 årsdagen for gennembruddet af #MeToo ser vi, hvordan bevægelsen til stadighed negligeres, latterliggøres og dæmoniseres i Danmark. Både i medierne og politisk. 
Vi vil aldrig sætte kvinders menneskerettigheder på venteliste, til fordel for andre spørgsmål. #MeToo-bevægelsen har vist, at uden et ideologisk selvstændigt politisk parti i folketinget, bliver spørgsmål som vedrører magt og køn ikke prioriteret.
.
Ligesom tidligere demokratibevægelser igennem historien har gjort, udfordrer Feministisk Initiativ de etablerede partier, når de påstår, at de har en politik, som er tilstrækkelig. Der bliver ingen forandring, uden fornyelse. Vi fornyer politikken med de mest gennemgribende og omfattende forslag til ligestilling, ligeværd, og realisering af menneskerettighederne.

80,"""Men det jag vet är att jag önskar att alla män, ja ALLA män, skulle ta och lyssna på kvinnors rädsla, berättelser och utsatthet. Och sen rannsaka sig och göra #metoo till ett verktyg att synliggöra sina egna tafsanden, övertalningar, tjat, utnyttjanden och övergrepp (för att inte tala om alla gånger killkompisar gått över gränser utan att någon agerat)."" ~ @ninarungs

När din syrra åker buss finns det en risk att  någon lägger handen mellan hennes ben. Din mamma är rädd för att gå hem från jobbet en kväll, för det finns en risk att någon förgriper sig på henne. Din syrra var på fest och trodde att stunden med ragget skulle bli mysig, men när han blev hårdhänt och hon sa nej så slutade han ändå inte - och ändå är det din syrra som får skylla sig själv 'för att hon var med på det'.
.
Jag har varit ganska besparad från sånt här... Den som nöp mig i baken i fjärde/femte klass fick en snyting och den som klottrade glåpord på husfasaden fick skäll av de vuxna.
När 4 av 5 har varit med om värre, så inser man att man har haft tur.
Vad gäller människor överlag så kan jag konstatera att människor som skadar finns i båda läger - hos tjejer lika mycket som killar - åtminstone när det kommer till mobbning och kränkningar. Både tjejer och killar sitter bakom en skärm och skickar hot, sprider kränkningar, eller ägnar sig åt utfrysning, skitsnack, m.m.
De killar som är rövhål går dock ett steg längre och blir fysiska. Tafsar, blottar, våldtar, är våldsamma.
Det är f-cked up.
.
På vilket sätt är det fel att som tjej kräva respekt? Att kräva att killar tänker på tjejer med omtanke och behandlar de därefter? Ömsinthet, sensualitet?
Att man som kille sätter tonen i omklädningsrummet, i grabbgänget - tjejen det snackas om är någons syster, dotter. Man skulle ALDRIG gå med på att någon behandlade syrran, tjejkompisen, dottern eller mamma illa. Eller hur?
Vad behöver du som kille göra för att skapa trygghet och bana väg för de du bryr dig om? Visst vill du att de ska kunna röra sig överallt och lyckas precis som du?
.
NEJ, alla killar/män är inte rövhål.
Men du som kille/man är delaktig i ansvarstagandet och tryggheten - eller avsaknaden av det. 👇👇",metoo,|Reflektera över hur många utav de du delar buss med som varit med om det. Eller de du rör dig bland på jobbet. Och bli en schysstare människa.,1

86,"i had a memory re-surface the other day about a friend who came into my life last year for a short time. she was great. she talked about spirituality, oracle cards, astrology. i thought
she was forever. 
i had such a connection to her. one thing though that kept coming up was how she had sexual trauma that she needed to heal and in those moments she was bringing light to something i, at the time, refused to look at. my sexual trauma. she cracked something open in me. around that time I also had this fascination with poetry out of nowhere and started purchasing books around sexual abuse and trauma without knowing that is what the book the was about. 
i kept cracking and cracking until one day it all came up and out and i was able to heal from surpressing everything i had gone through and talk to someone about it and move it all out of my body. shortly after all this healing took place something happened. 
this friend ghosted me out of nowhere. we went from talking one day to not at all. i was blocked on everything and haven't heard from her since. after a day of crying because i just didn't understand i had this peace fall over me because i knew had it not been for her i wouldn't have healed from everything i had and for that i'm forever grateful for the angel 
who came and found me in the dark and brought me into the light. not everyone that comes into our life is forever. most people aren't tbh. but every single person is here to help teach, guide or help us heal. #sarahunfiltered #metoo #speakup",metoo,|#poetsofinstagram #poem #newpoem #poetry #poetryofig #poetrycommunity #poems #poemsofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetsofinstagram #poets #poet #poetryofinstagram|🙌🔥,36

October 15 marks the two-year anniversary of the moment #MeToo went viral. In the days and months that followed, we saw more and more people coming forward with their stories of assault, abuse, harassment, and trauma. Founded and led by long-time activist and organizer, Tarana Burke, the #MeToo movement took hold of the public imagination. We started to have conversations about the ways women face harassment and trauma, often in the workplace. We looked at the intersectional nature of sexual abuse and whose stories get priority. Some men were held accountable, while some decried the movement had already gone too far. Now, those who came forward with stories of abuse continue to grapple with the consequences.",metoo,"|😂|👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾|Why not,  they stole everything else!",6
