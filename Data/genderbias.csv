3,"“Doc, I’m calling because Mr. X is wondering why the day is over and no doctor came to see him.”
.
I spent the entire morning rounding at the bedside with the nurse, social worker and pharmacist. When we arrived in Mr. X’s room, he was pleasantly surprised that we were all females. After introducing the team one by one, we chatted then I examined him and discussed his diagnosis and treatment plan. I answered his questions and addressed his concerns. On our way out, he commented, “Thank you for visiting me ladies. You have to be good looking to work here.” And yet after all of that, Mr. X didn’t recognize that I was his doctor.
.
From my first days of medical school, I was taught to look professional in order to make a good first impression with patients. I make good eye contact and listen well. I am also polite and smile a lot. My professional look includes pretty dresses and skirts, cute heels, and colorful lipstick. But, there are things I can’t change about my patient’s first impression of me. Underneath the white coat and professional attire, I am a minority female.
.
Frequently, I am called nurse in the hospital. Despite the name tag or being introduced by male colleagues as doctor, I am still mistaken as physical therapist, dietician, or some kind of aid who will bus my patient’s tray. While they are crucial members of the healthcare team, I just don’t understand why I can’t be viewed as doctor?
.
Sadly outside of medicine, I experience gender and cultural bias too. It came up in a conversation with one of the mothers at my son’s school. When I told her that I couldn’t volunteer on a certain day because I had to be in the hospital, she said, “I didn’t know you were a nurse.”
.
Let’s move forward from the rigid archetypes. Doctors represent all cultures and come in different genders, ages, shapes and sizes. The first 10 seconds of looking at me will not convey my years of education, training and my competence as a physician. I may rock a cute outfit under my white coat, but it shouldn’t take away the fact that I can take care of you and may even save your life.

Missed a class that would explain about literature reviews.
Missed a class on python.
Missed a day of lab work, when I should be accumulating data for my committee meeting.
.
Why?
My daughter fell face down in a grocery store sustaining injuries on her gums, tongue and several stitches on her chin.
.
Took the day off. My mind wandered to thoughts like:
.
Why can’t my spouse take a day off and take care of sick kids?
Why is it that moms take off?
Is it the judgement, we do on ourselves thinking that we are best at taking care of sick kids and can’t rely on dads?
.
We don’t want a messy home when we are back from work?😂
.
We think spouse job is more important than your own?🤯
.
Do we save our spouse from saying an excuse to their boss? So that they don’t look incompetent?
.
Also we do promote stigmas like:
Don’t email personal stuff explaining your situation?
Don’t talk about kids at workplace?
Don’t talk “my kids did that/this” as it may mark us as boring?
.
What do I do??!!
I do email to my boss. Once, when he gave me a piece of his mind that Phd is hard work, I sent an email with gross image of pus oozing out from my daughters ears. Gross yeah! But he better know what sh*t i am in too.(was planning to send the split chin pic also)
.
I openly talk about my kids and adventurous too. Having kids does not destroy my identity. You have to help ignorant people overcome this ridiculous thoughts.
.
I have taken my kids to classes which I TA. They sat at the back with their coloring books.
.
I am planning to take my girl for a benchmarking session as I don’t have the time to drop-off after paediatrician appointment.
.
Go ahead moms! 
Walk with that belly proud and give conference/classes.
Walk with your kids head held high with pride.
Talk to people about kids just as they talk about their pets and vacation trips.
Fight any condescending attitude and make sure they know ‘mom’ attitude too.

You have no clue how strong and amazing you are to do this!
You are great to manage a home and study/work.

13,"Today, we released our 5th #WiW2019 study, the largest study of the state of women in corporate America, and a joint effort with @McKinseyco. Contrary to what most think, the #glassceiling is not the biggest obstacle women face. The #brokenrung is. This broken rung results in more women getting stuck at the entry-level and fewer women becoming managers. Men end up holding 62% of manager-level positions, while women hold just 38%. As a result, there are significantly fewer women to advance to higher levels. So even as hiring and promotion rates improve for senior women, women as a whole can never catch up. ⁠
⁠
To get to #genderparity, companies must fix the broken rung. This starts with adopting best practices for #inclusive and #unbiased hiring and promotions—something only 6 of 323 companies have fully in place. If women are promoted and hired to manager at the same rates as men, we’ll add 1 million women to management in corporate America over the next 5 years—setting off a chain reaction at each subsequent step in the pipeline.⁠
⁠
Tap the 🔗 in bio for tips on how companies can solve this broken rung—as well as read the full study.⁠

How do you get past the manager that doesn’t recognize that doesn’t always have to be the case?|@anyribeirorocha|I never felt being a woman held me back until I became a mother.|I haven’t read the article but would just like to add that women tend to face the obstacle/miracle of having a child, too. Having a job that doesn’t support or nurture that new role makes it very easy to step out (especially if not at manager level), and just start over somewhere else, later. Additionally, If fathers and mothers both had better leave when they add a child to their family, the distribution of parenting responsibilities would be more even and allow mothers to comfortably go back to work.|Sad|@leaninorg I work for a fortune 100 company and this is so true! The only way to get promoted is by having a manager help you forge a path. I find that most managers have stay at home wives and look down on working moms. I think it’s an ego thing for them. I also think women speak up more and most upper management doesn’t want to hear about issues going on that affect our business, cause they think they know more. I feel as though I have wasted the last 17 years of my career only to watch mediocre people at best get promoted.|YES! This! And as companies continue to evolve and cut corners, they’re cutting out middle management opportunities, which makes it even harder for women stuck at entry level to advance to upper management and Director level. So frustrating.|Looking forward to diving into this study!|@denitraletrice|@joohyun_here|@jamiehowchin|Curious to read the full report, especially to see if the realities of motherhood are more deeply investigated this time around. When looking at the “broken rung” is it a result of bias against women or is it really bias against mothers since women often start their families about the time they’re ready for that promotion to management (about 10 years into their careers).|This is rampant in the human services feild|👏|I would have the man climbing over the back of the women n stepping on her to get to the top & have another man at the top of the ladder reaching down to pull him up.|@equalitycantwait|Clearly great work. Our research in the UK has identified the cause of the broken rungs. It's the Contribution-to-value gap. The difference between the percentage of women that are consistently speaking up (contributing whenever they can or should, leaning in) and the percentage that have their contributions consistently valued. The average gap is 22% in 2019. For part time women it is 40% with no difference in the academic achievement profile of those part time workers. So we are working on strategies that help managers and leaders learn the habits of giving 'balanced attention and feedback' - habits that over come their biases and enable equal recognition for all under-valued and under-recognused employees.

The American Society of Oculofacial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Conference was outstanding! #ASOPRS #ASOPRS50
Honored to present on the status of women in ASOPRS and our progress towards parity. 💪💪💪
Women constitute 20% of ASOPRS membership and 26% of leadership positions. In 2019 42% of our fellows were female. 
Our trajectory is trending upwards. 💯. In the last decade 3 of our presidents were female. 🙌
As more females enter fellowship, we will see female leadership numbers increase. We have a long way to go but with supportive men and outstanding women I have no doubt we will reach and surpass parity in the next quarter.

41,"I think it seems quite fitting that I listen to a talk by Caroline Criado Perez about her book on the gender data gap on International Day of the Girl today.👭🏻👭🏾
.
Caroline spent 60 minutes giving endless examples of how the world we live in is built for men, and I cannot wait to get stuck into this book 📕 to find out even more!
.
Now you might think it's odd that I share this particular book on this particular day. So why?
.
The talk I listened to earlier was completely eye opening. I was aware of the medical field issues but I didnt realise many, many of the others. And it was a reminder that we need to start doing something about it.
.
Young girls are never going to believe they can reach their fullest potential if everything in their world is biased against them. We need to change that so girls will have as much chance as the boys.
.
So what can we do about it?
Most of us will work in fields that cant directly and physically do something about this. But there is something we can all do. We all go to the ""default man"" sometimes. I do it too sometimes. You naturally assume someone's boss is a man for example. We all need to acknowledge that we do this and start to make these changes, and stand up for everything you can!
.
That's the way we can celebrate International Day of the Girl.
.
More news from New Scientist Live and of course this book coming very very soon!

Have you read this book already? What biases surprised you most? Do you pledge to join me in this change?

It’s easy to get caught in a cycle of overthinking, but ruminating about our stresses is both unhealthy and unproductive.

45,"Today is International Day of the Girl celebrating the strength and potential of girls all around the world today. This year the theme is “With Her: A Skilled Girl Force”, standing with girls everywhere as they inspire, innovate and take charge of their own future.

This is me aged 5 - full of dreams and potential. And I was lucky, I had parents who let me find my own path in life, who celebrated each and every one of my achievements and who were strong enough to set me free so I could grow into the woman I am today. Am I an accomplished ballet dancer? Hell no! But I have had a successful career in financial services, I have travelled the world and I have a happy home life with two amazing children. 
My son (7) sometimes tells his little sister that girls can't do XYZ or that's a boy's colour or a boy's toy but he always gets pulled up on it. His sister is the only girl in the football club at school but she is strong enough not to care and why should she? She has every right to be there. 
I am going to continue bring my children up to appreciate their own uniqueness and to see the opportunities it brings rather than the barriers it presents. They can both be whoever they want to be. And I will be as strong as my parents were when I let them go to follow their own paths.

And today I want to spare a thought for those girls around the world who aren't as lucky as me and my daughter. Those girls who face adversities that hinder their education, training and entry into the workforce. According to the @UN_women 1/4 of young people, most of them girls, are neither employed nor getting an education or training. And yet, these amazing girls persist, they succeed. They are innovating technology to solve global challenges, they are standing up for the environment, they are raising their voices against violence and they are preparing to run for office. They are incredible.

51,"“In every community, whether or not we know it, there are survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence. The process of healing after such trauma is always challenging but is made more difficult when the person is isolated from a community and made to feel crazy, lazy and stupid. In ways big and small, survivors are regularly silenced through disbelief and shame. Poet Adrienne Rich wrote, “Where language and naming are power, silence is oppression, is violence.” Aria Rising: Second Movement stands in the community to lift up the voice of the survivor, to amplify and validate their strength and listen for the sound of their new song.

Commissioned by Angel Band Project and Divinemoira Studio, artist S. Jewell S. McGhee created this traveling installation as a visual presence for the invisible work of music therapy that is provided for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence by Angel Band Project’s music therapists. Additionally, Angel Band Project works in communities to raise awareness about the prevalence of and preventions against sexual assault. 
There are things within our society that are difficult to even begin having a conversation about. For the survivors, music therapy offers a path toward healing. Music is powerful and restorative. Maya Angelou speaks for many when she said, “Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.” For the community, the presence of the art installation pulls individuals into the conversation around sexual assault in a way that softens and draws them in together.”-S.Jewell S.

52,"Because now it's time for us to be heard. Actually heard, not nodded to, brushed off, talked over, spoken to like we're children who don't understand our own pain, but actively listened to.

Because we NEED more options than the 4 not so great ones we have. And practitioners who are willing to explore those options with us.

THAT'S WHY NOW!

They asked us why we decided to start a pain centre for women, when the election has proven to disregard #womenshealth #genderbias in the medical system, and #pain - but we decided it was the perfect time to start educating patients, coaching medical practitioners and pushing policy makers. It’s time that patients had a choice where to seek pain resolution. It starts with you. You as a patient need to be the one to determine what therapies work for you, where to seek that treatment, and to hear the words from your medical practitioner that integrated therapies like #physiotherapy #osteopathicmedicine and #acupuncture are mere extensions of your journey. For more information click the link in our bio. -
📍Physicians need to be willing to have the conversation about integrated therapies.
📍policy makers need to allow patients to seek treatment (with or without a referral) and extend coverage
📍patients need to rethink their bodies, their pain management, and the social stigma of pain medications. 📍femade will be there when you’re ready

66,"When your friend books you tickets for your 40th birthday to go and watch a talk @ilkleylitfest by a woman @ccriadoperez who has an OBE, campaigns for women, and has written a book ‘invisible women’ which highlights the hidden ways in which women are forgotten exposing the gender data gap - a gap in knowledge which is at the root of perpetual systematic discrimination against women - everywhere from toilet provision, public transport, the way we measure GDP, to snow clearing in Sweden. ⁣
⁣
Here’s what I learned tonight:⁣
⁣
✅Yes you can be a red 💋lipstick wearing feminist⁣
✅Men can be feminists too (there were lots of them in the audience)⁣
✅Feminists don’t hate men, but they do get infuriated when women’s needs aren’t taken into account.⁣
✅Feminism is a movement ⁣
⁣
And my biggest takeaway was that “we should all look at our world around us and where there is ‘default male’ we should focus on challenging that.”⁣
⁣
In my world, I know that women experience mental health differently to men, in part due to our gender, but most definitely down to the harsh realities of the way in which we navigate our lives as women, and the social determinants that come into play. ⁣
⁣
Women are 2 to 3 times MORE likely to experience poor mental health, most commonly #anxiety and #depression, yet we don’t design our mental health services to meet that need. ⁣
⁣
Better gender informed mental health means listening and co-designing the way we deliver around the needs of women. ⁣
⁣
That’s my PHD proposal. ⁣
⁣
That’s my focus and that’s what I want to spend my 40’s challenging.  Just need to find a university to  support my research proposal .⁣
⁣
I’m on it, and I will make it happen. ⁣

I have always admired the great women of comedy because it is one of the best way to convey important social issues that affect women! ⠀
⠀
Humor is one of the best ways to convey information and I wanted to put it in my toolkit. I started small by doing open mics, with just five minutes of time for my set. ⠀
⠀
It was scary, but there is really nothing like the rush of the audience laughing to your words 😜! ⠀
⠀
After a few months, I decided to apply to the Detroit Women of Comedy Festival, because if you don't try, the answer will always be ""no"". ⠀

However, we do need to allow our girls the same access to science as we do our boys from as early as possible.

72,"QUESTION. OF. THE. DECADE. 
How do you get more girls into STEM subjects? .
.
Well, Sunday saw me and my @ri_science partner in crime @mjcuttsy showing off some simple science demos on @bbcone (see my story for the 💥) as I was interviewed about this. The demos were lighthearted and a bit of fun, but the question is a BIG one. Here’s my answer (that obviously was too long for tv)...
.
.
Getting girls into STEM subjects is not a ‘girl’ problem. It’s a societal problem that starts WAY before GCSEs. There is SO much more to this than I can cover in a 2min IV or even on here. But it’s not as simple as getting girls to ‘like’ STEM 😍👩🏻‍🔬
.
.
The problem is MUCH wider than simply getting more girls to ‘like’ science. For instance even though 3x as many boys take Physics than girls, twice as many girls take Psychology than boys. It boils down to gender stereotyping from a VERY early age. What we need to do is stop ✋🏻seeing boys and girls as having different likes. Instead view them as individuals (free from our gender biases, and my word we have A LOT of gender biases!). Children are individuals with a spectrum of interests. We need to expose them to a variety of toys, subjects, experiences and see what sparks their interest
.
.
We also need to give people the confidence to follow whatever it is they enjoy/ are good at, whether it is seen as ‘typical’ for their gender or not
.
.
Sounds simple but when clothes, toys, even pens(!) are divided into boys’ and girls’ versions with ‘boy’ versions focused on confidence, messiness, being strong and ‘girl’ versions on being pretty and sweet. THIS STUFF MAKES A DIFFERENCE. And it influences what children think is the ‘norm’ from a shockingly early age. We need to stop ✋🏻 it. And as parents, aunties, uncles, teachers we need to all start pulling each other up on when we see (or use ourselves) gender biases. That way we can all be free to like what we like and do what we like. Be that science, being a ballet dancer or an electrician or a nurse. We’d then be surprised by just how balanced the take up of subjects would be 😁

77,"We’re all human. We unconsciously discriminate on a daily basis. “Not me” is just not true - it’s virtually impossible to come to the table without preconceived  beliefs. So what can we do to battle the #genderbias devil within ourselves?  Here are 5 tips to consider in the workplace. 1. Assign out of the box roles to your colleagues.  Have you noticed how whenever you need a notetaker, cupcakes for a colleague’s birthday or someone to organize the office drinks it’s usually your female colleagues volunteering? Research tells us this is something called #officehousework and it’s disproportionately carried out by women workers. So cut the bullshit tasks from your female employees’ schedules and encourage them to #learntosayno. How about coming back with “I’m not sure you want someone with my hourly rate making the coffee run”? 2. Watch your language in the workplace AND at home. Tempted to call her #bossy? Don’t. Call her confident. Feel like she’s being #emotional? She’s actually passionate. Language matters. Use it wisely and remember that people tend to repeat adjectives almost as soon as they hear them.  3. Take notice of the hard workers. Research shows that we are more likely to notice the ones that tell us they’re good. And the ones least likely to tell us they’re good are women. What women are more likely to do is to keep their head down/work harder. So open your eyes and look around. Who’s helping you on that last minute pitch at midnight? Take that person under your wing. #mentorshipmatters.  4.Champion your female colleagues. Speak about them. Introduce them to others. Bring them onto projects that might interest them. Socialize with them. And don’t forget to praise them to your seniors when they’ve done a good job. An email saying “Mike, Mary delivered a flawless presentation today which resulted in Jeevan requesting a follow up meeting” - will increase visibility.  5. Encourage male colleagues to take paternity leave. Because female and male colleagues taking equal time off decreases performance and pay implications for women.",genderbias,"|hi, could you follow me, thanks",8

80,"Ich darf dienstlich nach Warschau und verlängere den Trip ins Wochenende, um auch privat diese Stadt kennenzulernen.
Als Schülerin und als Studentin war ich oft und auch im Ausland alleine unterwegs, in fremden Städten und Ländern.
Aber seit mittlerweile über 10 Jahren habe ich mich an meinen treuen Begleiter @nikosfairphone auf Reisen gewöhnt und bin total aufgeregt, alleine unterwegs zu sein. Ein echter Ausbruch aus der Comfortzone.. Was macht man/frau denn samstags abends alleine in einer Großstadt? Und ist das überhaupt sicher? Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, jemals Angst beim Reisen empfunden zu haben. Kommt das vom fortgeschrittenen Alter oder ist das Folge des allgemein angestiegenen subjektiven Sicherheitsgefühl? Ich stelle mir die gleiche Situation in Begleitung meines Mannes vor und die Angst ist weg.
Da ist er, der Gender Bias im Patriarchat. Denn ich glaube nicht, dass sich das Sicherheitsgefühl von Männern ändert, je nachdem, ob sie von einer Frau begleitet werden oder nicht.
Im Flugzeug hatte ich Zeit, den aus der Bücherei ausgeliehenen Reiseführer zu lesen. Zum Thema Sicherheit steht dort: ""Im Prinzip ist jede Ecke Warschaus rund um die Uhr sicher."" Das beflügelt mich. Ich sage es vor mich hin wie ein Mantra. Ich fahre vom Flughafen in die Stadt und stelle mir vor, jemand holte mich an der Haltestelle ab. Ich stelle mir vor, ich kennte mich hier aus. Ich stelle mir vor, ich liefe zu einer Verabredung. Ich stelle mir vor, ich verreiste nicht alleine. Ich nutze öffentliche Verkehrsmittel und bin dankbar für mein Handy, das mich kompetent von A nach B lotst. Ich gewöhne mich zwar nicht an diesen Zustand des Alleinreisens, aber ich erfreue mich an der Anstrengung dahinter und dass ich sie bewältige.
Die nächste Reise in Begleitung meines Mannes werde ich umso mehr zu schätzen wissen. Ist es eigentlich ok, den Männern diese Sicherheitskompetenz zuzuschreiben oder ist es zu viel verlangt? Überfordern Frauen ihre Männer mit solchen Erwartungen oder setzen sie gar unter Druck?
Ich weiß es nicht.. Aber damit genug der Kommunikation nach außen via Display, Internet und Buchstaben... Viele Grüße und ein schönes Wochenende noch.

MONEY! #patekphilippe #patekcalatrava .
Do you find yourself saying things like: Money can’t buy you happiness? Money is the root of all evil? Money doesn’t grow on trees? Well stop it! .
The fact is Money is a wonderful thing!  Respect it, love it, enjoy it!  Use it!  Money has never done anything bad to you, so why you hating on it?? If someone said to me I could do a job I love for the rest of my life but never make any money, I would tell them to shove it up your ass!!! I am not working the rest of my life!! I am NOT ashamed of making money and using that money to enjoy my life! .
When you invest your TIME in yourself to develop skills that make you valuable you don’t then walk into an interview and say it’s NOT about the money!  Fucking right it is!!!
.
If you have a skill set that is better than others you ask for money.  If you work harder than everyone else, you ask for more money.  If you produce more than the rest, you say “MORE MONEY”
.
Now, if you are a whiny ass little bitch who thinks because you got an English Lit degree from some liberal arts college you are entitled to more money then sit the fuck down and shut your mouth 🤐 .
You have not put in the TIME to have the experience and knowledge to ask for more money!
.
I keep hearing these terms “Gender Gap” “Equal Pay for Equal Work”🤷🏼‍♀️ Are you really doing “Equal” work?
.
“If you want to run with the dogs you can’t piss with the puppies”
.
Companies in the business of making profits don’t give a shit if you are a man or woman. They care about bottom line.  If you are important to their bottom line they will pay you what you are worth IF you negotiate it.  A big reason most women don’t negotiate more money is because they know they are Not doing equal work... FACT!!! I’m just holding up the mirror for you to take a good look at yourself😉

I mean men can be more loving than women.
....
This shirt has a story. 
I bought this piece of cloth and wanted a shirt like this.
My lady tailor denied as she can’t stitch a collar for the shirt.
....
My father took me to his tailor and he stitched this for me 😃
He stitched this in a day! 
I have to mention everything to my lady tailor but this man understood everything without saying 😇
Just like my father does.
.....
He reads my eyes before I feel my emotions on the surface.
He wakes up before I wake up from a bad dream.😇
These connections are beyond definitions!
I don’t tell him everything but he always knows before I tell him❤️

For all those more motherly fathers!

102,"POP QUIZ:  You go to your local garden center with a cutting from a sickly shrub, hoping for a diagnosis and treatment.  You see a thirty-something female coming towards you from behind the register to greet you, and a significantly older man halfway across the parking lot walking away.  Who do you assume will be better able to help you?  If you’re the person who will scream across the parking lot to talk to the guy, ignoring the female asking if you need help:  You might be wrong.  He’s the delivery driver. 😆 It makes me laugh.  At least 75% of people with a problem or question see me next to an older man, and immediately assume that I’ll be of little help.  People have walked right past me to speak to the new guy (who’s actually an accountant and has never worked in horticulture before). And it’s no knock on him, because he’s learned a lot this season- however, those same people who looked right past me will often get redirected to turn around and ask the short chick in the overalls for the answer.  I don’t know everything, but assuming that I know nothing isn’t serving those people either.  Pay attention.  You may just be under-serving yourself when you assume what someone is or isn’t capable of.  #unconsciousbias

Spoiler alert - this doctor could NOT debunk John Oliver’s points. While he speaks from an insightful, hopeful perspective he does agree that these biases do exist. For all you ladies who want to smash glasses and scream I TOLD YOU SO - enjoy this video ❗️ @doctor.mike - if you see this, we as a community appreciate your attempt to look at the various factors involved in each publication and wish there were more doctors like you.

This is something I have seen time and time again in female leadership as well as in myself when attempting to navigate in the professional sphere ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Women in leadership are constantly faced with balancing “masculine” traits such as being assertive, competitive, and direct while attempting to defuse any backlash that might arise if they are perceived as a prima donna, witchy woman, higher strung, and the list goes on.  The New York Times had an article last month that stated, “think of femininity as a tool kit, and choose something that feels authentic to you. But don’t choose deference”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
👩🏽‍⚖️ Unfortunately, what the article wrote on to say which I could not agree with more is that what women need to do to survive and excel professional is exactly the opposite of what they need to do to change it.

Mother’s Day cards tended to feature flowers, leaves, butterflies, bees and dragonflies, and Father’s Day cards were decorated with tools, stars, cars, and men’s clothing (like ties). In terms of content, Father’s Day cards emphasized supporting the family economically, imparting practical lessons, and being the best—far more “Number One Dad” or “Best Dad Ever” sort of cards than mothers had. “It was like they needed an award, but there wasn’t a lot of depth in what they were achieving,” says Auster-Gussman, a doctoral candidate in social psychology at the University of Minnesota.

123,"I was recently asked about what the internet and social media meant to me. I got kinda heated about it, and I realised I care, so I thought I would share it with you. “Digital, especially social, media were a revolution in representation. Most of us grew up without role models or famous people who were like us. The media, like any other old system, is still characterised by the same biases and limitations - youth bias, sexism, racism, heteronomartivaty, etc. The majority of mainstream outlets have been controlled by old heterosexual men since their inception, so it’s no surprise that diverse views and personalities are not represented. Today still, the majority of media reports are still written about men* and women* are mostly being written about or edited by men*. So even when we* are represented, it does not mean that non-limiting gender norms are strengthened in the published article - as somehow the clothes worn by women* are SO important to write about. My friend Amelie is regularly written about as the “mother” while her partner is the “pioneer” - even though they are both parents and pioneers in living a sustainable life in their tiny house. There is no such censorship on Instagram or other platforms - we write our own stories. I can share my messages without the filter of patriarchal media, and so can anyone else. We ourselves decide to follow people whom we find interesting. Some call it self-representation and taint the word negatively, but are they also calling out 50+ year old white males for narcissism who wrote their autobiographies and reality inspired fiction or poetry in the past centuries? Yes, social media has downsides and it’s not flawless, but at its best it can be a way for expressing our truth and be heard. I think the future needs us, and it needs us visible. I would have felt less alone and done more if at 15 I had had access to a community of inspiring changemakers in my age group. When I post I don't invest the time to flatter my ego. I post because I have loved storytelling since I was a child and because when I was 15, I wished someone like me was out there, trying to change things. The future needs all of us.” Thoughts? 💭",genderbias,"|📷 @nicolehitchins #instagram #socialmedia #representation #thoughts #florencegiven #tellourstories #media #genderbias #sexism #racism #heteronormativity #youthbias #girlhero #heroes #norawrites #soulvolume #coupdegueule #angryposts #mytruth #diversity #inclusion #censorship|A girl hero, and (s)heroes of all ethnicities, cultures, sexual orientations, ages, gender expressions, and more. 💫 note: I can only write about growing up as a girl because this is the reality I have experienced, but I want to acknowledge explicitly the lack of non-binary and ethically diverse  representation.

For years I have seen men (smart in their own ways) trying to impose their brilliance during conversations.

It seems like being outsmarted or outwitted by a woman is something unimaginable for men. As if their entire masculinity is dependent on their innate belief in their superiority in every domain.

This couple has chosen not to assign gender before the child is ready to tell them who they are. This is totally valid and we should respect this choice.|Obviously the parents can do whatever they want to but this child is a boy|Unhealthy and narcissistic|Is that what that says?|Right. Protect your child and mitigate bias by shopping your story for publishing on multiple platforms. That’ll show em!|The fact that so many people in the comments are upset by this just proves the couple right in what they are doing lmao.|@matthewchamberlain808 this is what I want for our future babies 😊 it’s no one else’s business what sex organs they have.|The first three years of a child’s development has the strongest effects on them. I actually did a paper on this very subject in school. Little girls are given pink clothes, dolls, and nurturing toys from the start. Vs boys who are given trucks, blocks, and blue things. People subconsciously even play with boys tougher than with girls. What they are doing is giving the kid balance and a chance to not feel the pressure of identity before they can decide what they like. It’s not insane. It’s smart. Further more if they watch tv with commercials. Remember they’re geared to gender identity. Giving little kids a pressure to be a certain way.|Just feel like gender as a concept has been vilified. Gender is not the enemy.|Um sorry but that’s fucked up|🤦|@plunkxtt us in future|Wow!! That is such a fascinating story to follow. From a sociology / anthropology pov how would humans deal with the lack of categorising. Love this decision from the parents too.|I intend to do this with my next child. I plan to raise them as human, not as a gender. And though I try to do the same with the two children I already have... The fact that other people knew the sex of the child from the start really complicated my ability to raise them without gender bias.|👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽|@sowingseason|If I ever have kids I plan to do this!😊 Can imagine it would frustrate/annoy people, but I think it would be worth the pain of dealing with that if you can get a new little person a better start in life.|I applaud the effort, but they will be seen as male on the days they are wearing “male” or gender neutral clothing.  They will be seen as female when wearing “female” clothes, skirts, dresses, bows, pink, etc.  I don’t think the parents will achieve what they are hoping for by doing this.  Instead, it might be better to focus on developing a strong sense of self that isn’t related to gender at home.  Sure, let the kid choose their shirt, when possible, but also bring home toys that are for building, nurturing, exploring, art, etc.—all categories regardless of whether a toy store would assign it to the boy or girl aisles.|Not completely sure...but assigning a child their biological gender at birth and/but offering at an age when they are old enough to understand, that not all children or people always feel comfortable with their apparent gender - can be a middle ground. I do feel we have to be careful to not swing so far an extreme direction, possibly because of what seems to be a definite “agenda” with some in power, that we demonize the natural gender-izing that happens with a baby and their natural-born genitalia.|That’s clearly a boy.|That baby is cute either way 🐣|And what exactly are they saving this child from?|And what exactly are they saving this child from?|This is so fascinating.|This is completely nuts imo.|A little bit too far. I gave my son cars but also dolls. Gave him blue, gray and pink clothes...

149,"Title: Beat the Puss y Up.

Hyper aware of the derogatory language our culture accepts without blinking an eye, this piece is exploring gender bias and sexism in language. “Beat the Pussy Up” is a commonly used phrase in rap lyrics and people are singing it without considering the repercussions of their words. To me, the phrase is literally referring to raping a woman, but according to www.urbandictionary.com, the verb means to f*** the pussy and is “commonly used in street talk and hip-hop culture”. This language perpetuates the idea that women are sex objects for men to conquest. The reproductive organs also loosely resemble a bull skull as a symbol of women’s strength and resilience. The painting is an anatomical view of a woman’s genitals and I chose to accentuate the fabric’s qualities by tearing and fraying the edges, which also serve as a comparison to “Beating the Pussy Up”. .

This is and probably will always be a sensible subject. But nonetheless, we need to talk about it. A friend of mine (@girlknowstech) recently shared an article about a school in Quebec (province in Canada) that have decided to split their student by their gender. Weird thing but, I guess this can be explain to an extant as long as everyone is learning the same thing right?.
.
But that's not the case, this school decided that when studying sciences, the boys would learn more about robotics, programming and computers while the girls' study will be more focus on plants and  gardening. This is the most ridiculous and frustrating thing I ever heard a school do in this day and age. But what are the impact of doing such a thing, and more specifically what is the impact on AI?.
.
As you may or may not know, AI learn from data. You feed it a bunch of information on a specific subject and AI learn to take a decision with all that information in mind. Amazon created a recruitment algorithm to do a preprocessing of resumes for job applications. .
Now this algorithm was taught to recognize ""good candidate"" from the mass by learning from previous employees aka learning from the past. But we all know the huge bias there is in certain jobs when it comes to gender (computer sciences is only one example). It learns what you expect it to: the algorithm was downgrading resumes that contained the word ""women"". .
Basically this school is doing the exact same thing this algorithm was doing (which ultimately had to be dropped because this bias could not be corrected). This is simply unacceptable.

Seconds later I was filled with rage and frankly offended and embarrassed! Let me explain, I felt rage because no matter how you look at it, no matter what era it is, it's 100% wrong in alot of ways!!! Besides, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't female's brains better with complex subjects then men? So wouldn't that make something as complex and intricate as programming a better subject to teach females? Offended because if I put myself in their shoes (either gender) it would limit my scope of learning and improving myself and most importantly limit my paradigm. In other words limiting the human potential!!! But most importantly, because I strongly believe that women and men are capable of equally great things and none are better than the other. I am embarrassed at the fact that even in this society, where women are advancing, there are people who are advocating such a primitive way of thinking and sadly it is adopted by many men with power thus limiting the generations to come instead of cultivating it to grow. As someone from the male species, I am embarrassed at the fact that there are men out there who want to belittle others due to their misguided beliefs. Thanks for sharing @theaigirl !!!!🔥🔥|You look beautiful @theaigirl ! I should check out that book! Thanks for sharing again!🤓💕🔥✨|Love love you bringing this up I saw @girlknowstech shared that article (thank you!) and that is so interesting about AI for preprocessing job positions and having learned from the past.

It’s overwhelming. I’m not surprised younger doc would report burnout more. I think they have more awareness of the issue and are more comfortable with the concept. I don’t remember hearing much about it back in the day.|Interesting study! Women resort to more unhealthy habits it’s sounds like with binge eating- thanks for bringing this up. We need to change the culture and educations surrounding burnout in physicians!|We couldn’t have coordinated this any better Hafiza! I just posted about medical school burnout.

It may be that things were always bad it is just that we are thankfully talking about it more these days.|Yes I am not surprised that younger physicians have higher rates of burnout than older physicians.|Interesting survey. It’s not surprising to see that women use junk food and binge eat to cope with burnout. I guess it has a lot to do with the emotional exhaustion they feel.

I’m also surprised that younger physicians experience more burn out earlier but the way that the medical society is going is it really a surprise?|Just heard such a moving talk about this this morning. One takeaway I got was we need to reframe it as mental HEALTH and checking in on that, as opposed to only asking about mental ILLNESS.

I’m Adam Rose, I’m reaching out on behalf of Gravity Defyer Footwear 
We’re a shoe company in Southern California focused on wellness, recovery and staying active for mothers, older folks, and older citizens respectively 
We’re looking for social media influencers like yourself to represent our company and our footwear to help us spread the word, gain exposure and help anyone who may be in pain or discomfort to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel—there is a solution! Foot conditions, back, knee ankle or foot pain, or any discomfort carried throughout the days can be devastating to your body, mind and overall self. That’s why we’ve created gravity Defyer and designed our shoes specifically to help with many different types of pain, discomfort and conditions. We even put our shoes through a clinical study to prove that they really do relieve pain.

My company will be interested in PAID sponsorships 
If you’d be interested in spreading the word about Gravity Defyer, please get back to us and let’s talk!

Our website is gdefy.com|👏👏😎|Always appreciate your posts|Wow those stats are interesting to read. I’m not as surprised that younger docs have increased rates of burnout though. While technology has made medicine easier in some aspects it’s totally changed the game in terms of documentation and actual patient interaction. I read a stat a while ago saying interns spend only 12% of their time with actual patients. A large majority is spent sitting in front of a computer typing. That sort of job stress really gets to us, and quickly. Thanks for sharing!|Those stats are crazy😭|Thanks for showing this data! This is so interesting!|Interesting stats !|❤️❤️❤️",349
163,"After receiving a $1.2m grant from #google the wonderful Geena Davis, star of Thelma and Louise, founded the Geena Davis Institute #gdigm which conducts research into gender issues in film. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Davis launched the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient, or GD-IQ, a method of using facial and voice recognition technology to analyse movies, TV shows and ads. The software is able to ascertain the number of women relative to men, as well as the amount of screen and speaking time they’re afforded
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“The GD-IQ is an extraordinary tool that gives us the power to uncover unconscious gender bias with a depth that had never been possible to date. Our hope is that we can use this technology to push the boundaries of how we identify the representation imbalance in media. Media that is more representative of our society not only fosters a more inclusive industry, but by increasing the number and diversity of female leaders and role models on screen, content creators are affecting the ambitions and career aspirations of young girls and young women everywhere. If she can see it, she can be it."" - Geena Davis

Our current health are system is not meeting the needs of women, especially women who are midlife and beyond.

Gender specific needs of women-menopause management, heart health, bone health, sexual health- are neglected due to lack of time during visits , lack of clinician education and #genderbias in care delivery. 
We must change #culture , end #bias, raise awareness, and force change. And it can’t take 208 years ( agree and thanks @melindafrenchgates )

Studies have shown that female patients 𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙡𝙮 𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙛𝙚𝙧 female gastroenterologists for both office visits and colonoscopies. Moreover, in terms of effective colonoscopies, female endoscopists have a 𝙝𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙚𝙧 adenoma detection rate than men.

So why are there so few women GIs? It is postulated that it may be because specialties like gastroenterology and cardiology require significant on-call duties, women, who often bear the brunt of responsibility for childcare, are less attracted to these specialties.

Though roughly 50% of medical school students and about 40% of third-year internal medicine residents are women, merely 21% of GI fellows are women. A 2016 survey of the top 50 NIH-funded medical schools found that merely 13% of department leaders were women. Furthermore, the American College of  Gastroenterology(ACG) has had just two female presidents, and the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) elected its first female president in 1942 and 1943; the next was in 2010.

Noticeably, women physician are 𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙙  in GI…

As per Medscape report published in 2019, male specialists earn 33% more than female. In gastroenterology, it showed a difference of about 53K dollars! This report used full-time salaries for compensation and part-time work didn’t account for the difference.

The gender pay gap is seen across every field like law, teaching, business, and entertainment not just in medicine. Even within women’s pay, race still plays a role. Hispanic and African women make less than White and Asian American women.

🔸First, acknowledge that this bias is real and truly exists
🔸Spread awareness
🔸Better access to education for women especially minority women
🔸Do away with imposter syndrome
🔸Encourage women to develop negotiation skills
🔸Increase the minimum wage
🔸Urge all genders to help women succeed in the workforce

184,"❌ “Women aren't good at maths or science” ❌

From a young age, women are subtly discouraged from pursuing maths and science due to their reputation as ‘boys’ subjects’. While this year more girls took science A Levels than boys, there were still many more boys taking maths, physics and computer science.

Research shows there’s a negligible difference in mathematical aptitude, and that poorer performance can be directly caused by awareness of this insidious and ill-founded belief that girls are somehow innately not as good. This undermining of performance has been researched across many groups who are stereotyped as ‘not as good’ at certain things. For example, a white 100 metre sprinter will not run as fast competing in a race against black sprinters because of the impact of this stereotype threat. 
We need more women in STEM careers, so let’s break down the myth, take away the stereotype threat and encourage women to thrive in *all* fields.

For this fact alone, my health suffers.

After watching a segment on @lastweektonight about gender bias in healthcare, my husband offered to come with me to as many medical appointments as possible, to be my backup when my voice alone isn’t enough. He’s my White Man, and in our twisted world, his very presence can positively impact my healthcare.

It’s difficult to see how quickly many doctors dismiss me and my symptoms. When I voiced my concerns to the most recent doctor, I was brushed aside, but when repeated verbatim in my husband’s White Male voice, the doctor paused and explained. When I requested a certain test done, the doctor said it was not necessary, but when asked by my husband he agreed. This kind of privilege can be hard to come to terms with.
.
In many ways, I’m also extremely privileged when it comes to healthcare. For starters, I’m white, cisgender, and heterosexual. I have a doctorate of physical therapy, and my overall health literacy is well above average for patients in America as a result. I have access to good healthcare and my choice of many specialists in my large, urban, academic city. I have the financial means to meet my deductible, and a family safety net should my healthcare costs supersede my available funds. I have friends and family who are physicians, PAs, and nurses, and can provide second opinions and valuable connections. I am extremely privileged in my medical care options.
.
And still, I encounter the enormous barrier of being a woman.

200,"When she becomes a mother

A moment of celebration at home,
While a moment of concern for her career.

She’s a window to the universe’s next generation,
While her window to opportunities almost collapses.

Her dictionary is being redefined,
Not be her but her insignificant others. 
From work challenges and successes 
She progresses and yet regresses, 
To sacrifices and compromises

What a hypocritical world we stay in ?

There’s a almost compulsion for a woman 
To be a mother,
While she ain’t celebrated in the workforce.

Fathers need empowerment for their daughters, 
But choose to disempower the expectant mothers (daughters of others), when they play bosses

What a hypocritical world we stay! 
Also when these Bosses are themselves mothers, and have mothers working under them, 
Are they truly empathetic managers ? 
How will we make this world a better place ever? 
If work-designations-corporations-investors don’t see families progressing and don’t celebrate their employees. 
How will we make this world a better place? -

💬 Hello! I’m Eileen C. West, MD, FACP (@eileenwestmd)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I moved to concierge care because I believe that when patients and their healthcare providers can have meaningful conversations – ones that last more than a handful of minutes – everyone benefits. When more details are shared, and more questions are asked and answered, a more accurate understanding is gained on both sides.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We’re not just forming a doctor/patient relationship, we’re establishing a partnership—one we know will lead to not just improved treatment of immediate concerns, but better overall health for years to come.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is the care you deserve!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For those of you who don't already know me, I am a board-certified internal medicine physician and have been caring for women and men for more than 15 years. I am passionate about helping my patients implement prevention practices, manage health issues and lead overall healthier lives.

Dr. Emilia Jarochowska, excellent communicator, lecturer and researcher at the Paleontology Institute (FAU), will be giving a workshop/talk on gender bias at the workplace/in higher education. You'll have the opportunity to hear about real practical examples of gender bias and share your own experiences in a dynamic and prolific atmosphere. 
All genders are welcome to join since we consider this event an excellent opportunity to learn, share and positively change our work/study environments, even if it just a slight change!

210,"WHY SHEMD? 💗

Last night, Lexie and I gave our favorite talk on what we wished we had learned in medical school to an awesome group of medical students in Chicago at the @womeninmedicinesummit preconference for students. It was such a GREAT reminder of WHY we created SheMD. 💗

The big push for me personally was when I found the literature on #physicianinfertility - it was the night I was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. I was on shift in the ER overnight. It was slow. And I was googling EVERYTHING about IVF treatments. And I stumbled across this article on female physicians. That moment changed SO MUCH for me. 💗

I knew I needed a way to share that with medical students. To tell them the lessons I had learned the hard way. To tell them that gender bias still exists. To tell them that the issues are NOT issues that are theirs personally but are universal and that we ALL are faced with them. And to tell them that despite what they hear they do NOT need to wait to have kids if they want them sooner. There is NO right time. It does not get EASIER after residency and it can become impossible. 💗

That is my WHY!  I absolutely love speaking to our medical students. I love that they have heard of the pay gap and the leadership gap and topics that were unspoken of not so long ago when I was in medical school. And I am always so proud of what we’re doing with SheMD when I hear the hush fall over the room and see jaws drop a little when I share our #physicianinfertility stats. 💗

So thanks to all who have supported SheMD in this last year. Please keep sharing us with your friends and followers so we can reach MORE medical students - female AND male with our message. 💗

She is also the creator of the Fearless program where she manages virtual group mentoring and career development for female engineers.

Her role as a mentor for women in engineering was not Stephanie’s plan. She began her career as a structural engineer, and even though she experienced bias, she thought it was due to her inexperience, not her gender. She found that just by being a woman in the field who was willing to listen, she was someone other women could come to and share their experiences.

218,"According to research undertaken by the non-profit firm Catalyst, the barriers facing Black women at work include things like more frequent questioning of their credibility and authority; and a lack of institutional support. ⁠
⁠
Black women reported experiencing a “double outsider” status — unlike white women or Black men, who share gender or race in common with most colleagues or managers. Black women report exclusion from informal networks, and conflicted relationships with white women, amongst some of the challenges they face. What can often make these challenges harder is the stereotypical prototype of Black women and limited range of stories shared in the media. ⁠
⁠
This is why global media company @Bustle launched the Black & Thriving package, which provides a platform for Black writers and editors to express the joy, heartwarming nostalgia, and the incredible honor that it is to be Black in America. In this episode, you will hear from Jada Gomez, Executive Director at Bustle.

221,"Women in Sports

When looking at sports as an industry, a nice way of looking at the issue of gender inequality is to pick
1) a sports crazy country with diversified offering (so that no one can suggest it is just the exceptional case in one sports); and
2) pick a representative country - not too big nor small - that all would consider reasonably OK when it comes to the way in which the government and the people talk about gender equality.
.
.
We chose Australia 🇦🇺 The result is shocking. Total underrepresentation of women in senior roles. And large representation in lower catering like jobs! And the rest? Probably left anything related to sports or sports management after their career!😱

Saddest part of the story is that the picture for you outside Australia would probably not be better, but worse!

“If you look at the workplace today, women are less likely to be promoted than men, and there’s also an enormous #paygap,” @amy_riveter says. “We want to create a workforce with truly equitable opportunity.” #GenderParityNow ⠀

225,"Equality. Diversity. Inclusion.
If you see a polka dot ribbon it represents work place equity and inclusion with out bullying or intimidation. 
The W.E. Ribbon design was inspired by the “We Can Do It” cultural icon Rosie the Riveter. The poster portrays a female worker wearing blue overalls and a bright red and white polka- dot bandana. The iconic image was created to support the need for diversity and inclusion in the workplace when women replaced the male workers who joined the military in factories and shipyards during World War II .
Women have been working in trades for many years. It’s not something to be intimidated by 😉 Embrace it.

Thanks for giving us female athletes a bit more direction and knowledge on how to #trainlikeawoman|Read your book like 3 times. Thanks for sharing all this information about sex differences. From the Dominican Republic.|Not sure if it was this paper or another  one by McNaughton, but the conclusion theorized that the 40 gm of protein was better because of the higher fat free mass ... in men. Just because a women is not ‘muscular’ should not be a reason to go low on protein. I recently had an ultra-runner female athlete with a history of fractures. Daily protein intake averaged 60gm. Certainly not muscular and certainly needs more protein.|Can you share the paper publication I go so we can also research?|Cool 👊🏼|Young men... young men... his/HER 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Just throw in a 'her' for good measure.

239,"Lisa Belkin first coined the term OPT OUT in 2003 to,describe women who seemingly choose to Opt Out of a Career ,ratchet back and redefine work after becoming mothers.

This is the age of the Internet ,so no woman who has opted out of work intentionally can be considered to be in Information Quarantine Zone.

Despite taking a bold step for a more demanding option ,such as to raise and care for a family,she cannot be considered lagging behind or limited in the race.

Wake up corporates ! Step up Flexible Work Options !
Empower  women and gain the advantage of a stronger work force,while still placing importance on the future generations. In the hands of every accomplished mother lies a wonderfully well crafted new generation. .

They I tell them they're so smart, or that they must be so strong if they do sports and other stuff. I try to compliment their skills.|You’re so well behaved; you’re so kind; you’re going to be a strong girl; you sure know how to be gentle; etc.|Talking about their favourite toys|So I realized this and constantly try to compliment them on their intelligence or attitude and talk to them about school or what they're upto and think of things instead of generic compliments|I love this! Also, fixed mindset vs growth mindset theory encourages us to compliment the efforts amd actions instead of placing labels on the child themselves. Like, when first meeting a kid at a gathering, asking questions like about what activities they like to do, and then connecting with the kid over the merits of those activities.|@gayatrir.93|Oh..that's so smart! How did you get so smart so young? Watch out for her everyone!|I’ve been told by a family member (a woman) at age 11-12 that my boobs were too big for a young girl my age and I should get them operated, So why limit socializations around appearances to just little girls. I had the sense to use fair judgement and realised that she was a total nut job. It also helped because my parents told me to ignore loose talk, both of whom who set very strong examples of what mattered most to them - their work and what they make out of their lives. The type of examples they set for me, helped filter out a lot of the other voices. I suppose it didn’t matter what other people thought. My comment is not to bring anyone’s experiences down but to engage in a dialogue about how we need to conduct ourselves as 20-30 year old somethings to bring up the next generation of girls!|I am however not saying that you ever come out full proof and well guarded against comments like that when you are a young person. Having an example in front only helps in better managing your feelings about such comments when they’re thrown at you, completely out of the blue. The reason why I’m sharing this today is because I realised how stupid people can be and decided to find my own path, never say another word about a persons appearance no matter what age, color, or gender *end of rant*|Compliments about their school work and hobbies.|@tunes_retuned do read this! ❤️|""Oh wow!

I somehow never thought I should have  complimented my nephews on kindness and generosity. Sometimes even compliments on attitudes can be gendered, I guess. I think just being really mindful around children helps and most apologising or correcting ourselves when we have engaged in gendered behaviour.|Simple rule of thumb when you're addressing children, people... Keep it genderless. Your comments or questions or any form of conversation with your kindergarteners should not be based on their gender. Talk to a child that is assigned female at birth like you would to a child that's assigned male at birth. (That's right. Your child should choose it's gender or even the lack of a gender, at an appropriate time decided by it. You really don't have any right to impose gendered norms on your child).|E.G. 1 I see you can standup and walk on your own. 2. You have silky brown hair. 3. Your smile makes me smile.|I use words like smart, clever and strong to compliment children.

Came across your page through @indian.radical.feminists story. But I would like to point out with respect to this post that, children will begin questioning their body, when they hear their parents speaking about not eating a certain food, going into diets because they are fat. Remember the kids at age 3-6 clearly don't understand the term fat completely, they may even term a kid who has inhaled air and kept his lungs full to show a bloated stomach as fat. You guys haven't pointed out that as parents, what we speak, what we act as for a topic, will be learnt by kids. Calling a girl pretty/cute or a boy handsome/cute doesn't make them think about their body. Yes it is necessary to make sure kids don't get worried about their body and consider calling themselves fat.",486

⁠
We expect men to assert themselves and promote their own accomplishments. But we often have a negative reaction when women do the same thing. This puts women candidates in a difficult spot. If they tout their achievements, it can hurt their chances of being hired. If they don’t, their achievements might be overlooked.⁠
⁠
What can YOU do to fight bias? 1️⃣. Ask your colleague to explore his/her thinking: “That’s interesting. Do you think you’d have that reaction if a man did the same thing?” 2️⃣. You can also reframe what happened: “I noticed that too, but I don’t see it as bragging. I just thought she was talking confidently about her talents.” 3️⃣. It’s also worth pointing out that⁠

256,"⁣Research on gender based differences in pain response and medical conditions has only slightly increased since the 1993 legislation mandating the inclusion of women in research. Yes you read that right, only in the past 26 years has it been legally required to include women in medical case studies.⠀
⠀
It’s difficult to say exactly how this has effected healthcare for women, but it can ben inferred that excluding women from drug trials has impacted their health negatively. It’s known that women process drugs differently because we have different metabolisms and fat percentages on our body than men, both factors that effect the way drugs and medications work.⠀
⠀
In the late 60’s, scientists were testing estrogen supplementation to see if it had an effect on rates of heart disease in women after menopause. So what did the scientists do? They enrolled 8,341 MEN to test this estrogen theory on. It was even until 1991 that the first clinical study of hormone therapy (for women) was actually tested in women. A 1986 NIH supported pilot study observing how obesity influenced uterine and breast cancer contained NO WOMEN. There seems to be a pattern here…⠀
⠀
In Doing Harm, Maya Dusenbery states, “Women have been excluded from clinical research, especially drug studies, for their own good - or at least for the good of their hypothetical fetus.”⠀
⠀
A 1977 FDA policy prohibited women of “childbearing potential” from participating in early phase drug studies except in the case of life-threatening disease. Critics pointed out that women were being treated more like “walking wombs” than people with real medical concerns.⠀
⠀
It’s also easier for scientists to use a cohort of men to test medical treatment on than women. Women’s fluctuating hormones through the month make it difficult and more complicated to measure results. It’s cheaper and easier to study one sex due to the size of the subject population needed.⠀

262,"TODAY is my birthday. 🎂

That means something to me that many of you don’t know, but I’ll explain.
🌱 
I didn’t get all those precious moments before and after “Back to School,” but I got the first-day pic. TODAY, I’m going to celebrate that. 🎉 
I lost more than 5 years with my little girl, but I get her 27% of the time now. TODAY, I’m going to celebrate that. 🎉

I never stepped foot inside my daughter’s preschool because I was 900 miles away, but last night I took my family to a “get to know you” event at her elementary school. TODAY, I’m going to celebrate that. 🎉

For more than 6 years after my daughter had been absconded, I had no capacity for joy — no space for happiness. But now I know my bigger purpose is to be a voice for the voiceless children and alienated parents. I’m learning the how’s, but TODAY I celebrate that I finally know the what’s. 🎉

I’m 41 years old today. I’ve never been in better shape. I have a supportive and understanding wife and family. I have friends who inspire me and make me better. I’m able to be more — albeit not equally — involved in my daughter’s life. TODAY I celebrate all of this. 🎉

To think I almost took my life late one night in January 2014 shakes me to my core. Why even say that here in this uplifting post? 🤔 
Because if you share it, MAYBE someone out there who’s thinking he or she can’t do it anymore will see this and feel hope. 🎉🎉🎉 TODAY I celebrate that I’m here and alive. I was here to be in this picture, and I’ll be here to be in many more. 👨‍👧 So TODAY, I celebrate.

Tomorrow, I fight. 🥊 🎯

- When asked whether you have a boyfriend, always say no to avoid further interrogation.
- If that doesn’t work, proceed with caution and DO NOT talk back and make things awkward.
- When remote relatives say that you should have children soon, the earlier the better because pregnancy is harder on older women, your parents can help you our more when they’re younger, or so that you can always have more when you still can, etc., maybe don’t tell them that you think children are hideous and that they ruin your career, if not life.
- Take this as a chance to suffer, to grow and to reflect.

But alas, feminism is not about doing the unexpected. It's not about breaking the stereotypes, it's questioning the sheer existence of it.

So, this year kannama wore pink and ate a car cake, cos she wanted to. Next time, she might want to be Simba from lion king or princess from Frozen.

287,"I am trying to be a strong female role model for my boys. But is that enough to raise boys who see the other gender as equals? *
*
📚 Walk into a children’s bookstore and you will realize that the overwhelming majority of books feature male heros. In the Time's list of the 100 Best Children's Books Of All Time, 68% of the books featured a male protagonist.  Basically, not even a quarter of the ""best children's books of all time"" center around a female character! Furthermore, if they do feature girls, they play second fiddle to boys or are less likely to speak up. I find myself acutely aware of this and wonder what it means for my boys...
*
📚 Without even realizing it, what if we are inadvertently raising children that perceive gender bias? The messages conveyed through over-representation of males and under-representation of females in books can affect children’s ideas of what it means to be a boy, girl, man, or woman. *
*
📚 So #GirlMoms and #BoyMoms, here’s a small action we can take to restore gender balance just by our choice of books : Seek out books that depict a girl as the main character, a girl who fights to save the day, a girl with a bright idea, a girl who speaks her mind. I’ll be sharing some of my girl-centric books from my collection on Instastories. Would love to hear your recs too!

288,"Your baby not reaching a milestone in time, should that bother you?
.
.
Well Nitya is 13months but still can't walk unassisted. She tries to take a few steps and then thump. So, she prefers to walk with the support of anything that's in her reach else she crawls like a pro.
.
.
Babies her age generally start walking unassisted and people around say that as soon as the baby turns one, walking begins, but this didn't happen in her case, neither did it bother me in any way.
.
.
She's active, eats well, sleeps well, doesn't throw much tantrums, her daily routine is sorted then why to bother? Someone pointed out once when I took her to my workplace and she was barely 11 months, 'abhi tak nhn chalti?' I want to answer that person - So what? When I don't have a problem, why do you? Also I used to hear, 'ladkiyan jaldi chalti hain'. Another gender stereotype.
.
.
All babies are different and grow at their own pace. I and my husband were in agreement to not introduce a walker (which probably all of us have used in our babyhood) after having a strict denial from the paediatrician. He said that it is just not recommended as it puts stress on baby's bones and muscles. So, we don't pressurize her to aim for any milestone. Afterall, she's not participating any race.
.
.
Infact it is her way of balancing it out and not putting much stress on the body. She starting teething at 4months and has full 8 teeth, 4 more visible - 2 canines and 2 pre molars in the upper jaw. So it is her way of slowing it down. I really enjoy the fact that I'm able to participate in each milestone and see her aiming for it too. Something I was always sceptical about while joining back work, I was disappointed that I might miss her milestone of walking. But guess, vibes travel, so she doesn't want her mommy to miss any of it.

DM @aprilmoon_boutique for the details and let them know Angelica refered you 🍭💕|Its always happening with me..dont disheartened dont worry..keep motivate your child🤗🤗|Primarily.. all the developmental milestones have range so even science/ psychology gives space to babies to grow as per their own bodies. 2ndly, Not all the babies are same in hitting their milestones. And lastly we should not compare kids in any way being physical dev or psychological dev.. so u r right in giving her space ❤️|So cute|Totally agree.. my 6 month old doesnt sit yet.. and I face the constant nag.. but I dont care.. she's going to achieve milestones at her pace ❤️|This is so well written..thanks for sharing|Ohh yar! It doesn’t matter at all.. my baby is completing her 11 months today.. she just put two steps without support.. Nd the same thing I use to hear from people..

Shivanya used the walker only for few days, uske baad she herself hates it that why would you all make me sit in it! so relax 🤗|Yes why you bother they have to walk for whole life don't give a damn to it let them enjoy their best phase of life 😍😍|My little one also started walking late..after she completed 15 months. People would keep blabbering as to why she doesn't walk. I would come back home disappointed and brood over it. Then the paed told us that every child is different and grows at his/her own pace, so no point getting disturbed over it.|Every child is different and grow in there zone! We as a parents should understand this. I remember, once my doctor said if you guys as a parent will only think like this than you will only hinder thr growth.. so be positive👍😊|My baby started walking in 15 months... In fact now he is 2 but still doesn't talk much. But it's ok..

May be I ll face this in future.|She’s adorable..super cute 😍😘😘|This is not a big issue, but as parent I understand the concern of others as we all want our babies to not lag behind other babies of similar age.We should not worry as some babies might learn little late, Good that u have not used Walker. Some babies might start to walk without support at 17 months.Walking involves balance and confidence. Not only does your baby learn how to stand up alone, there’s also the challenge of learning how to coordinate steps without falling. This takes time.|Of course it matters but as you said every child is different and unique.. so we should be patient and always encourage our child .. they will reach their milestones on time😊👍|Absolutely!! My daughter started walking unassisted only after 15 months. I was told things like.. girls walk earlier, give her a walker, her bones are weak etc etc. My point.. if her bones are weak why should we put extra pressure on them? She will walk when she is ready. Now, she is almost 3 and doesn't stay at one place.😁|My boy is not talking 😭 now it scares me. And development milestone has range as pointed out by one of the mommy, walking milestone  ranges b/w 9 - 16 months. So it's completely ok. Beyond 16 months is a concern. You watch her after one month , fasten yourself for running behind her🤪|Awww she doesn't want mummy to miss her milestone. That's sooo heart warming! 😊|Very true! Every baby has their own timeline for achieving their milestones and this should not bother any parent and let the child be in their own pace ❤️|The milestones months are the average age at which baby achieves a milestone. Some do it before and some much later. Hence an average age. That being said yes I have been bothered by late milestones merely because of listening to ppl bombard me with unsolicited advice n nuskhas and I could see they were smug abt my kid being late. Society is one big pile of sadistic people. Ignore them. Keep milestones age at the back of ur mind to seek expert help if u think it's getting too late..all the best dear!|Been there, seen that..

Only 1 woman made the list (shout out to Ross Stores’ Barbara Rentler) and they couldn’t even do her justice with a picture?  She’s #75 and the ONLY CEO where @forbes used a ghost pic. What a missed opportunity, and sadder yet, what a strong message this sends.  My 8 year old daughter and future economic contributor drew this cat. I’m pretty sure she could have drawn a better headshot for Ms. Rentler than what the @forbes team decided to use. Folks this is what unconscious bias looks like. Please @forbes learn from this.

Gendered language is commonly understood as language that has a bias towards a particular sex or social gender. In English, this would include using gender-specific terms referring to professions or people, such as 'businessman' or 'waitress', or using the masculine pronouns (he, him, his) to refer to people in general, such as 'a doctor should know how to communicate with his patients'.- this is not what I’m on about though... I’m talking about consciously using words that define one’s gender. I dunno 🤷🏻‍♀️ .

301,"These tips are too important so we had to share! Thanks @thinkorblue 
Re-post • @thinkorblue Did you know....? When there are more boys in a playgroup, they tend to interrupt their peers more often. And the girls begin to interrupt less. (From a fairly informal parent study called ""Boys Learn to Interrupt. Girls Learn to Shut up."") This behavior continues into the workplace and the boardroom. One study found that men are 3X more likely to interrupt a woman than another man at work. Yikes!

But YOU can help. If you're a parent or family member, notice when your son talks over other kids and gently alert them to the fact that ""Susie hadn't finished yet."" Similarly, teach your daughters to say ""I wasn't done yet"" or ""I'm still talking."" Model this at home and with other adults by saying it yourself. You can even translate this to the workplace, with a simple ""I'd like to finish my thought"" when you are interrupted.

And teachers! Teachers, you can pay extra addition to how much air time the children in your classroom occupy. In the BBC's No More Boys and Girls special, the teacher Graham Andre started using a hat full of student to names to pick who would speak next. What a great example of something fun and engaging for the class that helps to equalize speaking time.

Listen to Becky’s story of how she decided enough was enough after dieting for 10+ years. During this brilliant chat we talk about the false dieting dream, the consequences and the realities of dieting and why we do it. How different cultures, families and even our parents can influence our dieting obsessions. 
We discussed unlearning how we speak, think and treat others, including how to move away from the negative connotations around weight and body image. How dieting and the beauty ideal is a strong political sedative, especially for women.

.
The answer is definitely yes, and this is a problem .  We can talk as much as we want about  female leadership and helping women overcome glass ceiling and achieve equality with man, however it all doesn’t really matter if we don’t  work on our thinking first. Let’s start simply with observing our thoughts  and becoming aware of the gender bias towards both men and women we all unintentionally face 🙏

Establishing the gender bias free thinking on a personal level and spreading this message is probably the first step to building an equal society 🌍 .

________
Raising two girls over the past three years has opened by eyes to so many things I honestly, had never even thought about before. One of those things - is gender bias
🏵️
I first started noticing gender bias in the words of others. Then I moved onto noticing it in the toys and books lining the shelves of major stores, and then I started seeing it in many of the popular tv shows #nesandnaav wanted to watch
🏵️
It really makes me wonder about the impact this is having on our children. Our children are being put into boxes and categories from the time they are too young to even know their huge potential (AND THAT IT'S OK) to step over and blur the lines. These boxes give them subconscious rules to live by and alters the way they view themselves and those around them. Human beings are so multifaceted, shouldn't we be teaching our kids to embrace that quality from day one?

Our team and #impacthubmembers were honored to be invited to mentor the kickass women who dared to tackle institutionalised gender inequality concerning #femalefounders and #investment. We hope they all take their ideas forward and pursue real world impact.

Important crisis info in second pic. 
It's really difficult to get society to take this message seriously. We are all just deadbeats looking to shirk our financial responsibilities to our children anytime this is discussed. You're considered bitter, angry that she moved on, jealous that she is living a happy life. 
NO. I have no time to be bitter or jealous, I'm fighting for my life. The kid who means more to me than that relationship ever did. I'm fighting for a fair process where I dont have to fear losing time with my child because of what is between my legs. I'm scared of ending this process completely destitute, paying out the ass despite having 50% custody, with legal bills in the 5 figures, while she gets a free lawyer because she CHOOSES not to work to support her child, making her eligible for all manner of benefits and legal aid. Because for a woman, you are free to make the choice to stay at home to be an ""Instagram influencer"", because your ex and the government will foot the bill for everything. 
If I'm willing to put everything on the line and am going through a process that's slowly killing me, just to keep my relationship with my child, how in the hell can anyone believe her that I don't care about my child and that I'm not an involved father? 
This shit can drain the life out of you and take you to really dark places. If you need to talk, reach out.

311,"Thanks #lilsakos for bringing up this amazing contest. Since the day I conceived, the so called intelligent, judgemental society starts to rank the probabilities of an expecting mother having a girl or a boy. I had always hated this fact that gender stereotypes begin way ahead of a baby's birth.
.
.
Throughout my pregnancy I had been always told by acquaintances, colleagues, relatives, knowns and unknowns just going by my cravings, my choices, my bump that 'It's a Boy'. How can the curve of the bump tell if it's a boy or a girl. Really! some people try to act smart and just play their cards on guesswork while making it seem so confident. Khaane me Kya accha lagta hai? If you like salty stuff it'll be a boy, if you like sweets it'll be a girl. Weird!
.
.
I used to hear it so often, 'dekhna ladka hoga', these people really don't understand what impact does it actually put on the psychology of an expecting mother. Even without expectations for any specific gender, there comes a point when you start believing these claims. But, thankfully I started following a series on YouTube- Virtue Baby featuring BK Shivani and it really helped me to re-allign my mind and soul. She said that never ever expect a boy or a girl just wish for a healthy and happy baby as the vibes and the feelings travel to your baby and this might make the baby feel unwanted. This changed my whole outlook and I just started wishing for a healthy happy baby despite people still randomly dropping their guesses. .
.
I even senitised my husband, my in-laws and my parents on these thoughts so that there are no expectations. I had been really lucky to have a supportive family. So, when my daughter was born, everyone was just so elated to welcome a happy and healthy baby. And that was it! @lilsakos

So, her first big function was  Lohri. Many people interjected and said that Lohri function is not meant for girls. Well, it didn't bother us, so we went ahead and celebrated her First Lohri when she was 5.5months with full fanfare. And followed by her Mundan ceremony when she was 9months and then her first birthday. For her first birthday, I didn't choose for pink theme or princess theme for her birthday as I really don't like the fact how colors are attached to gender, creating a need for another dialogue around it. I went for Rainbow theme which is a celebration of all colors and her dress was Gray color as it's the most neutral color. My way of smashing gender stereotypes. #lilsakossmash
.
.
All the celebrations not only was a reflection of our happiness and contentment to have our first baby but also broke gender stereotypes. As some people still pointed out that 'look at them they are celebrating all functions for a girl'. But, I'm ready to take on all there mouth pieces and make my daughter a stronger and smarter personality who herself will take on these gender stereotypes and fight them with confidence.

・・・
Every summer, @LeanInOrg leaders from all over the world come together in California for our annual conference. I look forward to this all year – it’s so energizing and joyful to be with these remarkable women. This year, our community is larger and more global than ever: there are now more than 44,000 Circles in 172 countries. And the Leaders I spent time with this weekend capture that incredible diversity. They’re launching tech start-ups in Tel Aviv, running activist bookstores in Athens, challenging gender stereotypes in Tokyo, and doing outreach in response to a suicide epidemic in Saltillo, Mexico.⁣
⁣
In Circles, women support each other through all kinds of challenges, like re-entering the workforce, starting businesses, switching careers, and dealing with workplace bias and harassment. As our keynote speaker Dr. Bertice Berry put it, we may have to do the work on our own – but we don’t have to do it alone. We can be there for each other along the way.⁣
⁣
I’m so grateful to these women for bringing change to their communities – and for inspiring all of us. To start or join a Circle near you, head to leaninswitzerland.org and contact us! 👉👉👉 LINK IN BIO 🔗

Now let’s talk about kids notebooks for a second... Freddie is 4 & loves pink so when he was faced with an entire wall of fluffy, sequinned, unicorn/flamingo/rainbow covered options he didn’t bat an eyelid. Swipe to see his choices 💞💪🏻 ⁣

But it did make me want to scream, why aren’t there any unisex or boy designs in WHSmith!!?? The teacher in me couldn’t help but think, how are we supposed to encourage little boys to love writing if stationary doesn’t cater for them!? 🙄 ⁣And then low and behold, Aldi came up trumps with a sequin football notebook!! 🙌🏻⚽️ 💪🏻🖊⁣
⁣
This week (even before school started!) Freddie has been non stop with his colouring, drawing and writing and it makes my heart burst seeing him write his name! So these 2 notebooks are sure to get lots of action! 📝

I was planning on buying coloured paper and found this whole pile in a charity shop for £1.50 🙌🏻 And Jack found that bunny 🙈🐰 which he insisted on carrying & then pushing home in his trike all by himself...... let’s just say, it took while 🤣⁣

328,"Implicit Gender Bias in the OR - Thanks to @maraantonoff for yet another great article on gender bias in surgery. I have witnessed many times the different treatment of female surgeon’s by OR staff. Implicit bias is universal in medicine and contributes significantly to the burn out of female surgeons. I cannot tell you how many times as a resident I saw male and female surgeons ask for special equipment and have the staff run out the door to get the male surgeon what he wants quickly and without zeal. However, when it was the female surgeons, the eye would roll and they’d be asked if they were sure the really needed that, and have to hear the comments in the hallways about how needy the female surgeon was and why couldn’t she just “deal” without whatever she was given. How, a raised voiced by a male surgeon is simply him being who he is, but a female is “total b****”. Unfortunately, this is mostly women on women behavior. And it has to stop. We are all professionals. We must all be respectful. On all sides. Don’t be defensive if you’re an OR nurse or scrub tech and you’re reading this post. This may not be you. But, we can all reflect and think about how we can do better and how we can stop the behavior of our colleagues in order to make a more professional work environment for everyone. #genderbias #implictbias #femalesurgeon #femaleplasticsurgeon #womeninsurgery #hickoryplasticsurgeon #hickoryfemaleplasticsurgeon #rosieroedermd #hickorync @womensurgeons @amwadoctors #somedocs",genderbias,"|Sadly have seen this way too many times.

329,"Paleoanthropologist Leslea Hlusko, shown holding a primate skull, is wearing a fake beard for a good reason. Hlusko and dozens of other women in #paleontology glued on facial hair and posed for photos as part of the Bearded Lady Project. The resulting photo exhibit and documentary film playfully make the point that the stereotype of paleontologists as rugged, hirsute men is not quite accurate. The project also aims to shed light on the obstacles women scientists face. Hlusko is a professor at UC Berkeley, where the photos are now on display. In the documentary, she talks about her love of fieldwork: “For me, being in the field with the wind blowing in your face … at those moments, I feel like me.” Photo/Lexi Jamieson Marsh, On Your Feet Entertainment.

335,"Thank you guys SO much for your outpouring of love and support. This community is hands down the most beautiful thing that I’ve ever been a part of. The true rose amongst the thorns of being diagnosed with endometriosis.
.

My on camera interview with @3rdhourtoday was the first time I ever told my whole story from start to finish (Link to the segment is in my bio ICYMI!) I talk about pieces of it all the time, so, I never thought it’d be so emotional. I also never thought I’d be telling the entire world that at one point I’d lost my will to live. Yet, here we are. I hope, if anything, it painted the picture of the emotional toll this disease can take.
.
I can’t stress enough how important talking about this disease is. Let me tell you why. I took a look at the NIH @nihgov (National Institute of Health) disease research budget for the year 2020. Of a proposed budget of $34.4 billion for disease research, next year, endometriosis is estimated to receive just $6 million. That’s less than ONE DOLLAR per person living with endometriosis. Yes, you read that correctly. LESS.THAN.ONE.DOLLAR. When I say that endometriosis is criminally underfunded, that is not an exaggeration. Now, let’s compare it to a disease the affects nearly the same amount of people, like asthma. Asthma is estimated to receive $279 million dollars for research in 2020. There isn’t a single person on this planet who doesn’t know what asthma is. The same cannot be said for endometriosis. Awareness matters.
.

I don’t share these statistics to frustrate you. But, I do hope it lights a little fire under every single one of us to continue to demand that things change. Our collective fight and voices are strong and powerful!",genderbias,"|You did great! I've said it before but thank you for being a voice and an inspiration!

336,"Sex and gender play a significant role in diseases ranging from migraine to Alzheimer’s: symptoms differ between the sexes, progression is unequal, diagnosis may benefit from different biomarkers, and response to treatments vary.

When it comes to brain and mental health, many researchers often only use male mice or don’t even specify the sex of the mice used for experiments leading to women being underrepresented in clinical trials.

September is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month and the Women’s Brain Project advocates for changing the way research is done in relation to women’s brain and mental health based on sex and gender, a first step to precision and personalized medicine.

More on this, read our article by @sradjy published at “All In: The Human Subjects,” a documentary (Will I be next?) filmed over 5 years following human test subjects who are at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. 👉 http://willibnext.com/investing-in-womens-brain-and-mental-health/?fbclid=IwAR36puLrO5ROPHycdkzTuflgSFnpvkzu7G_nfLLo0xdW1RLrLSqxdGV4Whs

337,"Day 120: Response regulating

With reviews filtering in for one of my recent fellowship applications, my blood pressure has been on a slow boil the last few days. 
Of the four expert reviewers, three have provided reasonable commentary on my proposal and the potential shortcomings. They have sought to clarify a few details, and despite the fact that some of these details were already in the proposal,  I believe this is simply a reflection of my failure to communicate these things well in the first place.

Reviewer number four was a different story. With plenty of critque's of the science (again, fine - this is the purpose of a review after all!) came a sprinkling of personal probes (""Why here,  why this"") and opinions about my life choices. While my official response is calm and regulated, there were a few things I couldn't include.

First of all, ECRs are doing the best that we can in a funding environment sucked dry by older generations round after round. Please try to remember this before musing on paper about why a 'well-positioned' candidate might have applied for something you view as a bad career move. Secondly, people make career decisions for all manner of reasons - some political, some practical and some personal. Please don't presume that a candidate has the luxury of deciding where and what science to pursue based solely on passion and curiosity. Unfortunately, neither passion nor curiosity pay the bills.

Happy sciencing! 👩🏼‍🔬

Ⓜ️
But, unfortunately this is the population that is least likely to pick up weights.
Ⓜ️
I’m sure there are several reasons, including gender-biases, medical biases against women & also just not knowing how or where to start, being afraid of getting hurt, looking like a rookie in front of others...
Ⓜ️
Currently, there is still no evidence-based recommendations for strength training specifically for women v. men….
Ⓜ️
And there should NOT be! Y’all should lift weights exactly the same as we do! Muscles, joints and nerves are the same whether you’re male or female (with the exception of a few anatomical variations)
Ⓜ️
All it takes is an individualized assessment to tailor the exercises to YOUR BODY & YOUR GOALS.
Ⓜ️
The key is to establish a baseline, appropriate load tolerance, and then plan out smart, logical progressions with someone who understands how to make the right modifications when needed.
Ⓜ️
I’ll keep saying it…”you’re as young as you MOVE.” Age is NUMBER; it’s not a disability. Stop sitting around and withering away...

I had such painful cycles in my middle school years that my Mom had to get narcotics for me, and I would have to come home from school. I would lay in my parent’s bed in the fetal position until I basically passed out- the pain was equal to labor pain from what my physician said.

The pain is no joke.|25 years ago here in Canada, I wasn’t diagnosed with endometriosis until I had fertility problems. I had a laparoscopy...and there it was. Besides the infertility, I now had validation for the EXCRUCIATING PAIN I had every month. I was prescribed medication to take during my period, which was a God send.

My doctors kept giving me pain medicine to relieve the lower back pain I was having but this wasn’t the answer. I kept telling them “it only occurs the week prior and during mensuration” I knew it was correlated to one another but getting my OBGYN to see it was long and hard.
They just thought some girls get worse cramping than other’s. Finally a specialist did an endoscopy and found 80% scaring. I was told get pregnant now or you may never have children; fortunately I did at age 40 and 41 but to live with the pain since being a teen was unbearable|@jodilynmagruder|Finally endometriosis is being revealed as the horrible thing  it is!!!!!

My pain and health concerns were ignored.  Since this time I always insure I have a female doctor to address my female health.  In my experience, I do not fear a male doctor can address concerns.|Feminine disorders are mostly under researched and frequently ignored in medical schools.  I suffer from Lipedema which was identified in 1940 at the Mayo Clinic. It’s not taught about in most medical schools, research is now picking up in the US and Germany is leading the way in treatments for this disorder. Lipedema affects approximately 10% of women and a few men.  It is believed to be affected by hormone changes like Puberty, pregnancy and menopause.  Without treatment, lipedema can severely affect mobility.  #lipedema #lipoedema|Another great reason why I (a SAHM watching morning shows on the treadmill) watch the Today show exclusively for morning TV.

It took almost 15 years for me to be diagnosed and I was actually finally diagnosed by a male OBGYN. I had been to countless women because I felt more comfortable, and none of them were willing to do exploratory surgery. I had previously been on countless medications and hormones that didn’t help and affected my body poorly. As a result of the late diagnosis I lost a fallopian tube, and almost lost the second; it was devastating.

“And it continues throughout the clinical research process, where women remain underrepresented, analysis by gender is rare, and women’s differing hormonal states and cycles are usually ignored entirely. Meanwhile conditions that disproportionately affect women have often not been deemed worthy of research funding and time.

Do you know that migraines are 3 times more common in women than in men too?

Τhey are the second cause of a neurological disability and the sixth most debilitating condition globally in terms of years lost to disability!

Even though migraines do not shorten people’s lives, they affect work and family life in terms of ability to function during attacks and lost work days. They are still, however, highly stigmatized, under diagnosed, and under treated!

September is the World’s Alzheimer’s month and this week (September 1-7) is dedicated to Migraines. Let’s celebrate and educate the world about this debilitating disorder during this Migraine Awareness Week!

358,"🚻⁣The gender disparity and diagnostic delay🚻⠀
⠀
A 2015 study revealed that women experienced a longer lag time from the onset of cancer symptoms to diagnosis in six out of the eleven types of cancer studied. A 2013 study concluded that ✨twice✨ as many woman as men had to make over 3 appointments to a general practitioner or family doctor before being referred to a specialist for suspected bladder cancer. A similar finding is seen with renal cancer.⠀
⠀
Women are more often deemed suffering from psychological disorders. It took an average of 12 months for men to get diagnosed with Crohn’s disease compared to 20 months for women😑. Men were diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 4 years compared to women’s 16 years😥⠀
⠀
I believe there are many factors to why this exists. Women are often seen as complainers, and symptoms, especially when vague lab tests or examinations come back ""normal"", are often dismissed. Women are also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses. But the fact is, ⁣women are less likely to have their pain treated, their symptoms taken seriously or to be given a diagnosis than men. ⠀
⠀
My point is not to blame doctors for their wrongdoings, prejudices, or biases, but to bring awareness to this issue. Each year, an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 people die due to diagnostic errors in the US alone. I know way too many women that have had dismissive and even condescending experiences with healthcare professionals and need to know that this is a wide spread issue and entirely not their fault or it's ""all in their head"".⠀

370,"❌ “Women are hormonal and illogical, so they can’t perform as well as men” ❌
.
The first post of our #MythbustingMonday series is here! Why is it that women are branded as “hormonal”, when hormones are simply essential to human functioning? Evidence from the field of neuroscience shows that the male hormone testosterone has a detrimental effect on the cognitive ability to assess risk (an essential aspect of leadership). Plus, studies show that men and women have an equal ability to be logical in decision making!
.
When writing her book, Diana realised she needed to understand the psychology behind women’s struggles in the workplace. So, she did a psychology degree! 🧠  Her expertise allows her to break down these outdated myths using factual, scientific evidence. .
In the book, she delves further into the psychology of gender biases to provide you with practical solutions #linkinbio #MythbustingMonday #UnderstandDareThrive .

372,"For the babymamas and sympathizers dropping comments that I'm bitter, maybe try understanding another persons perspective, or simply unfollow. 
Maybe if you had to pay a large portion of your paycheque to your ex, only to end up watching him spend it all getting his balls waxed, getting tattoos and ensuring his new gf has a better lifestyle than you, despite not wanting to get a job to give it to her, you wouldn't think it so ""bitter"" to vent your frustrations in memes. 
I love how its always the women COLLECTING the cheques who act like money is no object and $600 is nothing. As if they could just write up a cheque like that every month 🙄

Meanwhile she had a bigger house and got married in Hawaii and stopped working (for 10 years now) and had 4 more kids I watched my husband work every weekend trying to maintain it all (I work too) and I just couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. My mom was a single mom and my dad didn’t contribute much if anything so I completely see the need for dads to help support, but my mom worked really hard and had us full time. The way it is set up now allows moms (who want to) completely take advantage and it’s not right. Men have higher earning power but that doesn’t mean they should be punished for having a child and have to pay everything while the mom sits and collects.|💯💯💯💯💯|It's so sad and crushing to see this gender bias happen.|The system needs to open their eyes and see what is actually happening, so much assumption and generalising. No wonder there are father's that take their own lives. 😢|This is so fucking true!",35
373,"Men are raised to be providers and Women are raised to be nurturers...
Boys are told to focus on studies and build a career while Girls are trained to sacrifice their wants and needs so they can take care of their family's needs happily...
The male gender is always given an edge at work place while the female gender is passed on from promotions since employers worry they may leave after getting married and having kids...
Giving a few examples of women empowerment is not enough...
Most women still face gender bias all life long...
Just because we choose the greater good over selfish gains does not mean we don't deserve to be treated equally...
Women deserve equal opportunities...
Girls deserve to be taught Financial Independence, Career Responsibility and how to focus on Professional Growth...
Boys need to be taught being a Bread Maker, not just a Bread Earner...
Kids should be raised equally and that is the only way we will progress as a society...
Think about it before you decide the fate of your future generations who count on you for knowledge...
HAPPY WEEK AHEAD MY DEAR FIT FAM !!! 💪❤

374,"A little background:
My ex and I share 50/50 custody. She left a 70k a year job to sit at home smoking weed, collecting govt benefits and living off her rapper/drug dealer bf. So because she claims to have no income and a total disability (despite clubbing every weekend and working under the table as a hairdresser), I pay both MY financial obligations to my daughter, as well as my exes. 
She wants $600 a month. And childcare, despite having no job. 
I had several hearings where I was made to feel like a deadbeat because I pointed out discrepancies in her financial disclosure. 
I have had to hire a lawyer that I cannot afford in order to argue the obvious, but it has finally paid off, and now I've been granted all of the exes financial information. 
It sucks that the courts force you to go broke paying a lawyer simply to seek a fair family court process, essentially forcing fathers into financial insolvency simply to ensure they can support their kids in their OWN home.
If I were working under the table, shirking my responsibility to my child, the courts would come down on me with the wrath of God. But if a female does the same, she's ""just doing her best"". .

390,"I so enjoyed reading this story.  This is a global movement!  @unwomenaust Meet Christine Wambulwa, smashing gender stereotypes in Kakuma, Kenya as the only female mechanic.

Every day, by 7.30 a.m., she is at the vehicle repair shop along the highway. “I don’t have a weekend,” she says. “If someone has a vehicle break-down in the middle of the road, or in the bush, at any time, I will go. I like this job too much.” Christine grew up in Kakuma town watching her brothers. “When the boys made toy cars, I made toy cars, when they looked after cattle, I too looked after cattle. I thought I was a boy just like them!” When she grew older, there was not enough money to educate her and the family had many mouths to feed. She learned to repair vehicles. “The first vehicle I repaired was a Toyota lorry,” she says. “In the beginning, it was a little hard, I had to carry heavy things. But now we have better machines to lift heavy things.” Christine believes that women can do anything that men can do. But there are still some challenges in her line of work. ""Men don’t believe that a woman can repair a vehicle. A man will think ten times before giving me a vehicle to repair,” she admits.

That doesn’t stop Christine from doing the work she likes doing. She is the sole breadwinner of her family since her husband’s death. She is putting her own children through school and supporting her brothers and sisters too. “With the refugees, more opportunities have come too,” she says. “Things have opened up a little— there are more women drivers now. Earlier, very few girls went to school in this area. The culture was the main factor holding them back. But now many girls go to school—girls from Kakuma town and the refugee camp.” Christine’s message to other women: “Do not fear. Work is work. Nothing’s hard for a woman, it’s only in the mind.” -

392,"Last year I shaved my head. I was turning 30, was unhappy with the health of my hair (I had bleached it A LOT), and wanted a “fresh start.” So I went for it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was prepared for some people to look at me sideways, but I was NOT prepared for the depth of how many people would struggle with it. Friends, clients, complete strangers...I don’t think a day went by where someone wasn’t confused by me.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I no longer fit into their gender box so neatly. “So, are you a lesbian? Do you have cancer? Why did you do that?” People constantly asked me super invasive questions, as if they had a right to my energy, my personal info, my time...completely entitled to an explanation about why I didn’t fit into their idea of what a “woman” should be.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And all the while I was physically experiencing freedom, which felt super confusing to feel like my freedom/comfort/groundedness was causing everyone else to feel deeply uncomfortable...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It was an eye opener. I hadn’t understood my cisgender privilege until I gave a little bit of it up. I’m eternally grateful for the experience, as I feel like I have a teeny tiny experiential piece of what it might be like to live outside of the gender binary.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So next time you feel curious about someone’s gender/sexuality/identity, maybe just sit with that curiosity 🥴⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Maybe the urge to relieve the discomfort of not knowing is something that belongs to YOU to sit with, and not something that you actually have a right to know...maybe the discomfort of the unknown is not something you should hand to the other person. Maybe allow your relationship to develop to a point where they might feel inspired to share with you. Maybe ask for permission before asking deeply personal questions.

402,"In reality it is unknown to a father If his child is truly his.

409,"The word “scientist” does not specify a gender. And yet, ever since conferences and symposiums emerged from the primordial academic soup — the majority of prominent scientific speakers and panelists have been men. This phenomenon has been documented in many studies and spawned mocking monikers. “Oh no, not another manference!” “Did you go to that himposium?"", and so forth. On June 12, 2019 (seriously, 2019!), the effort to achieve better gender balance has a new champion: the long-standing director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins. Dr. Collins sent a clear message of concern: ""It is time to end the tradition in science of all-male speaking panels”. His announcement was applauded by scientists who have long urged speaker diversity at conferences.
.
I can personally attest to the fact that out of every 10 speakers giving a prominent talk at any given conference, the female to male ratio is easily 1:9. My direct experience is limited to Alzheimer's, brain aging, and neuroscience conferences (which nonetheless means tens of thousand of people) -- but while I wish more women were keynoting in other fields, my non-Alzheimer's colleagues report the same dismaying stats. Most speakers are male (and white male, at that). But then, most lab directors are male. Most grant awardees are male. Most tenured professors are male.
.
It is no wonder then that we have an enormous gender-bias in science and research, not just in terms of who's running it, but also in terms of what's been studied. Women have been left out of research until the mid-1990's!
.
Certainly men are wonderful contributors to the biomedical enterprise -- and it's never about women without men, or women instead of men! It's about acknowledging that there’s a tendency to neglect that lots of women also contribute to research. Dr. Collins said he will no longer speak at conferences that don't ensure adequate gender representation. I hope that more male scientists will feel inspired to do the same!

When it comes to women and their healthcare, we are still years behind. Large gender gaps in medical research have led to gaps in knowledge about how to diagnose, treat and care for women and their health. At WAM, we are raising funds to support gender and sex based research in Alzheimer’s, a disease that disproportionately impacts women. Two out of three brains with Alzheimer’s belong to women and no one knows why that is.

421,"""Suffering with joy."" I heard this phrase yesterday on the radio and it so clearly summarized what I believe the expectation is for women with chronic illness. Sweep your pain, exhaustion, confusion and well-justified anger under the rug for the comfort of everyone else. It comes as no surprise that society would expect women to consistently display a good-natured disposition; this is a normative gender expectation. However, the pressure to ""find joy in the journey"" graduates to magnificent proportions for women who have chronic illness. Every day, I am bombarded by Memes, inspirational posts and cliched representations of chronic illness. These are targeted toward women! They have pastel colors, feature adorable animals and are packaged in ways that are supposed to appeal to females. They make me cringe. I feel no guilt about my anger regarding chronic illness. I am entitled to be mad, sad, envious, depressed, cranky and every other emotion that feels authentic. I've been through some cataclysmic torture and that deserves recognition. So, I just want to encourage all of the women out there to feel safe in expressing the full spectrum of emotions.

⠀
Physiologically we have different levels of hormones〽, a 30-40% increase in blood volume🎈, different metabolic rates🍝, and cardiovascular function💗. It’s no surprise that medications work differently in men and women’s bodies.⠀
⠀
In 1989 the Physician’s Health Study enrolled 22,071 people (all men) to see if low dose aspirin lowered the risk of heart attacks in men over 50. This same experiment ✨wasn’t✨ conducted on women until 16 years later and concluded that aspirin had no effect on heart disease risk for those under 65, but did help those over the age of 65, in addition to reducing the risk of stroke, a benefit not found in the the male only study. Had the original study included women, these findings would have changed the way heart disease💔 and stroke were treated in women.⠀
⠀
Women have a greater risk than men of developing dangerous heart arrhythmia💓 that can be triggered by various drugs such as antibiotics, antidepressants, and cholesterol lowering drugs. Beta blockers have been shown to have a stronger effect on women than men. Women respond better to SSRI’s (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) than tricyclic antidepressants💊 while the opposite is true for men. Women suffer from more side effects of anesthesia during surgeries and medical procedures🏩 and generally wake up faster than men due to metabolic differences.⠀
⠀
After 700 reports of patients getting into car accidents🚘 the morning after taking the approved drug 🚫zolpidem🚫 (the active ingredient in Ambient), the FDA decreased the regulated dose for women. Had the original study included women, it may have been discovered that women took longer to clear the drug from their bodies, and hundreds of injuries and deaths could have been prevented.⠀
⠀
There is so much about society where I revere the concept of equality between genders, but with healthcare and medical treatment, careful attention needs to be made between sexes so safe and appropriate treatment can be applied.⠀

432,"Well. It’s Friday. @taylorswift’s new album is out. And you all MUST LISTEN to this song. Love her or hate her, she’s dropped a song about #genderbias and it’s FIREEEE🔥🔥🔥. Lyrics below.

The Man
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
That would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes you
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?

And they would toast to me or let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

Would you like to worry about drinkin' and dollars?
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars I'd be a bitch not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that) And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
And I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man 
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man 
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

I'd be the man
I'd be the man

If I was a man, I'd be the man

Black women disproportionately are heads of households, they make up the largest group of minority women-owned businesses, and they're a key voting bloc with one of the biggest voter turnouts — when you lift up black women, you lift up entire communities. ✨

یکی از سوگیری های ذهنی که در گفتگو اتفاق میفته، پیش داوری هاییه که افراد نسبت به جنس مرد یا زن دارند.
اغلب ما از کودکی در خانواده و بستر جامعه، حرفهایی درباره جنس زن یا مرد شنیدیم که الگوی ذهنی ما رو شکل دادند. بطوریکه در حین گفتگو حرفهای همدیگه رو به زن بودن یا مرد بودن ربط میدیم.
گاهی قضیه به اینجا میرسه که تا حرف کسی رو نمیتونیم با استدلال و با منطق پاسخ بدیم، در جواب میگیم： شما زن ها فلانید، یا شما مردها بهمانید. غافل ازینکه اینگونه پاسخ ها گفتگو رو به بن بست میکشونه؛ چراکه سوگیری های ذهن مون درباره جنس زن یا مرد اجازه نمیده حرف همدیگه رو اونطور که هست، بشنویم.

439,"The likability trap is the idea that to be perceived in a positive light, women have to be viewed as ""likable"" first - when women behave assertively or out of self-interest (behaviors deemed appropriate attributes for leadership), they're often viewed as bitchy or cold — both of which lead to poorer workplace outcomes. ⁣
⁣
Yet, when women lead with warmth, they can be perceived as less competent or less “leader-like” — it’s a ‘damned if we do, doomed if we don’t scenario’
⁣
In her @nytimes Joan C. Williams suggests that, to overcome the likability backlash, women can try to do something masculine in a feminine way.⁣
⁣
She says: ""Think of femininity as a toolkit, and choose something that feels authentic to you. But don’t choose deference. One study found that women who used a submissive conversational style, apologizing and hedging, just undercut themselves...""⁣
⁣
This still feels unfair and let's be honest, emotionally exhausting, though I can see why it would be effective.⁣
⁣
Let's discuss... ⁣
⁣
◽️ Should women have to find the ""just right"" mix of assertiveness and warmth to be taken seriously as leaders? ⁣
⁣
◽️ Where does authenticity come into play? ⁣

◽️ What do you think of the suggestions included above and what’s worked for you?⁣

Happy Janmashtami #instafam

Who is better, girl or boy?
In our world, we still have stereotypes people who want the boy to be firstborn or there should be a boy to take family name ahead. So, what do you think about this? 
Children come to the world in the same way, the difference is only how we raise them.
Generally, by the age of 3, children understand their own gender and difference between male and female bodies. We should teach them its only biological difference not mentally, emotionally or physically.
Both boys and girls can learn to do all kinds of chores and share the same responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, caring for younger brothers and sisters, and using tools and machines. Don’t assign genders to activities and objects. 
Dhivija loves to play pretend play of daycare with all stuff toys and as well as love to play with cars and get dirty in the sand.

Gender equality helps us know that boys and girls have the right to be treated the same until they can decide how they want to represent themselves. We can gift this to a child - a new little person who will grow into a beautiful person inside and out. A girl can also take family name ahead and make everyone proud.

When we have the same curriculum and subjects in school for both boys and girls and then why we raise them differently at home?

Let's try to understand that a boy could love pink and girl could be crazy of blue. Let's accept that masculinity and femininity resides in everyone of us. Men too look cute when they feel shy and women can look damn brave with a sword.

May be equality couldn't solve the problems but ""the right to do what you desire"" could. And that's what freedom is...

449,"Repost From @dreleahholder SWIPE LEFT >>>>>>>>>>>>> ~DrLizSpeaks on #BlackWomenEqualPayDay:

Black women are the most educated individuals in the U.S. (Source: ThoughtCo.com). The average Black woman has to work until August 2019 to be compenssted what the average White male was paid in 2018. It’s the 21st century, and it’s disheartening that gender and racial issues continue to peril our advancement. This is a frustrating reality for many Black Women in corporate America. ****************************
The idea of Equal Pay Day originated in 1996 as an event that would bring awareness of the gender pay gap. This day is recognized during the month of April. However, August 22nd has been designated as Black Women’s Equal Pay Day. *****************************
How can we improve Black Women’s Equal pay? 
I would recommend that corporate allies in executive leadership and sponsorship roles create awareness in their organization’s regarding compensation inequity. According to Women in the Workplace @leaninorg, there are several strategies to support and improve Black women compensation (see the list on page 3). If you are in position to advocate for equity, execute these strategies and #PayMeWhatYouOweMe !

451,"SWIPE LEFT >>>>>>>>>>>>> ~DrLizSpeaks on #BlackWomenEqualPayDay:

Black women are the most educated individuals in the U.S. (Source: ThoughtCo.com). The average Black woman has to work until August 2019 to be compenssted what the average White male was paid in 2018. It’s the 21st century, and it’s disheartening that gender and racial issues continue to peril our advancement. This is a frustrating reality for many Black Women in corporate America. ****************************
The idea of Equal Pay Day originated in 1996 as an event that would bring awareness of the gender pay gap. This day is recognized during the month of April. However, August 22nd has been designated as Black Women’s Equal Pay Day. *****************************
How can we improve Black Women’s Equal pay? 
I would recommend that corporate allies in executive leadership and sponsorship roles create awareness in their organization’s regarding compensation inequity. According to Women in the Workplace @leaninorg, there are several strategies to support and improve Black women compensation (see the list on page 3). If you are in position to advocate for equity, execute these strategies and #PayMeWhatYouOweMe !

Today is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day. It marks how far into 2019 Black women have to work to catch up with what white men earned in 2018 alone. ⁣
⁣
For millions of women, the pay gap is painfully real. But many people don’t even know that it exists. New research from @LeanInOrg and @SurveyMonkey has found that one in three Americans aren’t aware of the pay gap between Black women and white men. Even fewer are aware of the pay gap between Black women and white women, which — though smaller — is still sizeable.⁣
⁣
On average, the pay gap for Black women amounts to nearly a million dollars in lost earnings over the course of a career. That’s huge. And missing out on that income doesn’t just hurt women. It also hurts their families. More than 80% of Black mothers are breadwinners for their households. Being paid less means less money for groceries, housing, childcare, and tuition. ⁣
⁣
These numbers are a powerful reminder that we still have a long way to go before our economy and our country are truly fair and equal. Fighting for gender equality means fighting for all women, especially those who face bigger obstacles and fewer opportunities. That’s what today is all about. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay",genderbias,|Black Woman need equal pay,55
453,"#BlackWomensEqualPayDay falls on August 22nd this year. White women make on average 80 cents on the dollar as compared with white men, while black women make on average just 63 cents on the dollar, according to PayScale.
⠀⠀
That means black women have to work about an additional 142 days to make what white women make and about 215 days to make what white men earn in a year. Is this fair?
⠀⠀
Not paying black women the same for equal work impacts all of us, affecting our workplaces, our communities and our economy. That’s because:
⠀⠀
80 percent of black women are the primary breadwinners.
Black women represent 53 percent of the black labor force, while women overall account for about 47 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The number of businesses owned by black women has surged by 164 percent, which is nearly three times the rate of growth for women-owned businesses overall.
Black women are also the most educated group in the US, with women making up 64 percent of black students who earn bachelor’s degrees.
There are many factors perpetuating the wage gap across gender and race, from lack of sponsors and pathways to advancement to stereotypes and biases. - via @forbes

461,"GENDER BIAS IN MEDICINE

An article was published this month in Academic Emergency Medicine.

And it found something I know I have felt more than once during residency: the boys are treated differently (better) than the girls.

We always teased our two male co-residents about ""the power of the penis"". Not to take away from their amazing abilities, but they both got to sit at the robot sooner, did more in cases earlier in our careers, and seemed to garner more respect and confidence from everyone around them, especially the nurses.

So it was no great surprise to see the conclusion of this study that looked at gender bias in nursing evals of EM residents: ""Despite the lack of difference in ABILITY or COMPETENCE as measured by in-service exam scores and milestone evaluations, nurses evaluate female residents lower in their abilities and work ethic as compared to male residents."" Ouch.

@nataliecrawfordmd has talked about some of these issues in her #asawoman podcast and shared stories of other women experiencing the same. It has touched all of us. But it was startling (and disheartening) to see the data show it too.

GENDER BIAS IS REAL FOLKS. And some of the worst bias is coming from other women.

I get it and have been guilty myself. Men have a natural ability to instill confidence and lead and they dominated medicine for its early years.

But #thefutureisfemale ladies and we allll gotta check our own subconscious biases at the door and SUPPORT OTHER WOMEN.

So I am not at all surprised that nurses would feel more negatively about female residents - I would bet they probably would have scored them low even if not comparing to men. I am not sure the exact etiology of this but I suspect it has something to do with the gender bias, patriarchal culture, and the sort of dog eat dog attitude that sometimes we have to have to survive as females not afforded the same privilege as males in our society and workplaces... definitely needs to change!|I love the awareness and this is about to help me write a essay in college!

We were told of all kinds of things: 'your dad used to hit you'; 'your dad used to do this…' You don’t remember any of this happening but you start to believe it because otherwise why would anyone tell their children that? Then - that was it. No contact. She took the relationship away out of spite against him. She had the biggest weapon of all and she used us against him."" - Sarah

Even though she was a narcissist and abusive, he was never given the rights he deserved. He fought for custody in court and was granted weekend visitations and then ten days a month, a right his ex-girlfriend did not honour. She would play games and make EVERY single child exchange extremely difficult and toxic, exposing their child to undue stress, blaming him in the process."" - Girlfriend of an alienated dad

https://bit.ly/2HitHZP

There came a time when my mom, likely fueled by her anger towards her husband and her own mental health issues, sat me down and told me I had a biological father. After everything she had put me through and subjected me to, she decided to unleash this on me as if to intentionally cause pain and emotional suffering. When I had questions, she told me dramatic tales of a drug addicted man who held a knife to my throat when I was a baby, who beat her repeatedly in front of me and my brother, and who was so incredibly evil, that she had no other choice but to completely cut him out of our lives."" - Victim of alienation and an abusive stepfather

464,"Gender bias in leadership in GI .
.
Women in gastroenterology are also less likely to hold institutional leadership positions. A study published in 2017 revealed that only 7% of gastroenterology division chiefs and 18% of gastroenterology program directors were women.
.
.
This trend continues in gastroenterology national societies. In fact, there have only been 17 women presidents since the inception of the four gastroenterology societies, ASGE, AGA, AASLD, and ACG. .
.
This disparity also extends to private practice and endoscopy ownership. A 2008 study revealed that women were less likely than men to own an endoscopy center (29% vs. 54%; P=0.03) or their own practice (50% vs. 75%; P<0.02).
.
.
While the statistics remain discouraging, it is important to recognize that the gender trend in leadership is slowly changing. In fact, in 2017 the presidents of all 4 national GI societies were women! .
.
As a fellow entering the field, I’m so excited to see the gender shift as more women take leadership positions. .
.
These role models serve as great mentors to future aspiring physicians. I strongly believe that with strong support and camaraderie among women the gender gap within gastroenterology can ultimately be closed.

The mental load is a killer!

There's been such an amazing response to our teacher tips to prevent gender bias in the classroom. But, of course, we can't look at gender without looking at other intersecting factors, like race, immigration, and disability.

Tip #18 in our series (full post in profile) is to look at your own anti-bias work on a daily basis. OUTSIDE of the classroom. Who do you spend time with? Who do you listen to, through social media, blogs, news, or podcasts?

Today I wanted to share some of the incredible accounts that I highlighted in the blog post - folks who are leading critical questions about race and education.

Boys learn that what they do has importance while girls learn that how they look is more valuable. Where are you changing the conversation?

Missing out as a father. Being cut out your children life is painful. August has never been a good month for me. Death of my family always on or around my birthday. 
I ruined a neighbor’s day, who had just taken some pics of his own little ones for the first day of school. I just got home too a nap it was really all I could do to not burst into tears, knowing how pathetic I looked.

Empty bedroom. No hair to brush. No mouth to feed. No body to hug. No spirit to encourage. No listening to our favorite songs or conversation in the car. No tearing up as they go too class waved goodbye.

But trust me, there are still tears — made it back inside just in time. 😞

We were raised with a constant reminder of needing a husband one day, even before we understood the complexities of relationships...
We have been constantly asked to raise out self worth for others image and status, but we are ridiculed if we prioritize our own self esteem...
We are called selfish for wanting a career over marriage, yet called useless when we choose to be homemakers...
We are either trying too hard to look good and attract men, or we are not worthy enough for men when we choose self love and body positivity...
We are tagged wannabes if we archive our own glory, while those who want a man to make their dream come true are tagged gold diggers...
It is high time we climb down from this unfair pedestal, pick a ladder for ourselves and climb up to our own destinations...

483,"Hey'all! 💜
I'm delighted to see lots of new faces around here - many of you found me through Friday's blog post about teachers and gender bias. So glad you're here! .
.
🤔You might be wondering, what is Think or Blue? Well, if you're not a word play fan like me, it's a play on our culture's obsession with labeling babies in the womb with #pinkorblue. There's nothing wrong with finding out your future child's sex, but the expectations we attach to it are more and more narrow. Tiaras or Trucks? Touchdowns or Tutus? Blech!
.
.
You get the idea. It feels a little stifling. We've forgotten the layered complexity of all children. ✔️Think or Blue is here to bring parents, relatives, and teachers together to take a critical look at these gender stereotypes that we just can't seem to escape. And move into a world where our kids can embrace their individuality and create a more compassionate society.
.
.
And who the heck am I? 😎I'm Catherine, I live in Connecticut with my almost 4 year-old and have been obsessed with gender equity and feminism since long before she was born. But her existence crystallized for me the need to quash gendered expectations once and for all. So we can let our children be themselves.

Some of my favorite things include dark chocolate, Gilmore Girls, my family, Paramore, smashing diet culture, becoming more anti-racist, painting with my kid, and dance parties. Oh, and the occasional mojito.

I'm excited to work with you to forge a world where children feel confident on the inside and out, and are ready to change the world! 🌎Who's with me??
.
.
.
P.S. I have lots of free resources linked in my bio so check it out: a body image guide, a 5 day email course for raising confident girls, the feminist parenting resource library, and 7 ways to parent without stereotypes. Hope you find them helpful.

First you have the event.
Then you have the many perceptions of the event.
Then you have the escalating oral transmissions of the perceptions of the event.
Then you have the several written documents from the various oral traditions. 
Then you have the interpretative sermons from the various documents.
Then you have the rise of the most popular documents.
Then you have the councils that decide which is the only authoritative canon.

I’m going to hazard a guess that in the early stages of this process women were significantly involved. 
I’m going to hazard a second guess that in the later stages they were not.

499,"But there are a lot more things, while reading articles and a bit of research type things, I came across a lot of points, so here are those which I found, well I tried to express them in an effective way, so lets get to the main points.
So there are few stages or so called careers which are set by the fake society,
This careers are considered as 'manly' professions like IT/technical, fireman/police etc, and it's tough for a guy, who wants to pursue his hobbies like dancing, sketching, etc.
And if a man quits his job for looking after his child, then the society behaves and treats him like a coward, most appropriately ""a guy who eats his wife's earnings"".
And you all might think that only girls are raped then my friend it's absolutely wrong, while reading an article I came to know that in 2007, about 52% boys and 47% girls were raped. Suprising isn't it?

Here is an incident, when I was at a age of around 11 or 12 but I still remember it, everyone had seen transgender on trains, in general compartments or sleeper compartments, and I have seen everyone gives them money, but while traveling with my parents, I heard a man around 45-50 next to my compartment saying one of them (the transgender), SHOW YOUR PARTS AND TAKE THE MONEY, well at that time being a kid I didn't knew what he was talking about. Well now, while reading the articles, that incident clicked.

So guys, here's my thoughts on 
BIAS SOCIETY FOR BOYS
Hope you liked it,

I choose this topic first because everyone is busy with the girls inequality, and it seems to me as if boys don't face any problems.

There are alot more points,
But I may exceed words limit.
So will upload that partwise around 1 or 2 or even more.

Follow me if you don't 
And yes next one will be on
BIAS SOCIETY FOR GIRLS.

514,"Whenever people talk about the injustices against dads in family court, there's always someone asking, ""What if my dad actually was a deadbeat?"" ""What if my baby daddy actually is this, this, and that?"" ""Yeah, but my dad did this, that, and the third."" ""What if family court goes after certain fathers for a reason?

The answer is simple: shut up.

The conversation isn't about you. Fathers deal with enough disrespect without you using their stories as a platform to get attention. Either help them find solutions, or shut up, listen, and learn so you don't end up in their situation.

And the same goes for those of you who interrupt someone's positive talk about fathers to whine about yours. Have the decency to wait until someone asks you for your story.

Thanks @rachel_sex_therapy for sharing! “I’ve said this before and I’ll point it out again… Menstruation is caused by a change in hormonal levels to stop the creation of the uterine lining and encourage the body to flush the lining out. The body does this by lowering estrogen levels and raising testosterone. Or, to put it more plainly ‘that time of the month’ is when female hormones most closely resemble male hormones. So if (cis) women aren’t suited to office at ‘that time of the month’ then (cis) men are never suited to office. If you are a dude and don’t dig the ladies around you at their time of month, just think! That is you all of the time.” #justsaying 🤷🏻‍♀️",genderbias,|Wowwwwww!!!!!|#genderdiscrimination #misogyny #patriarchy #smashthepatriarchy #genderbias #capitalismkills #glassceiling #genderinequality #genderinequalityintheworkplace #socialconstruct #emotionaltolerance #emotionalawareness #emotionalintelligence #doublestandards,100

⁠
More importantly, if the review committee uses a narrow definition of leadership, they may unfairly exclude a lot of people, like this woman. ⁠
⁠
What can YOU do? 1️⃣. Point out that the woman’s team delivers superb results, and suggest that their performance speaks to her leadership. 2️⃣. You can also ask them to explain the attributes she lacks. When people are asked to justify their thinking, it can help reduce bias in decision-making. 3️⃣. As a longer-term solution, suggest creating detailed metrics for performance reviews, including clear expectations for leaders. This way, all employees will be evaluated based on a more complete definition of good leadership and using the same standards, which reduces bias in the review process.⁠

538,"Is your handbag weighing you down? A symbol of the patriachy?
.
.
This great article by Lisa Miller (link in comments) which I first heard discussed on the Bang On podcast starts with a story of a lady who dropped a full coffee on the subway and every man stepped back, all empty handed and every woman stepped forward after digging in their handbag for an assortment of wipes and tissues to mop up the spill. This is continuing to reinforce the stereotype that women clean up spills.
.
.
I know that when I get a chance to go out without my handbag, I feel so free and light. With two small people, I am so often carrying half the house between nappies, snacks, hats and sunscreen.
.
.
The article by Miller details the handbag throughout history right through to present times where women are loaded up like pack horses. A man without a briefcase or suitcase gives the appearance of ""being so important he has people to carry for him... golf caddies, bell hops, assistants, women."" .

542,"Microaggressions 😳⁣
⁣
I debated as to whether to share this 🥺⁣
⁣
Swipe (1) to see a  text communication between me and a male physician who had consulted me on his patient ⁣
⁣
As you can see - he told me to take a tranquilizer.  I was shocked and as you can see my response was a total wimp out . ⁣
⁣
Then I read this article in JAMA surgery (swipe 3)
⁣
There are 4 types of Microaggression (swipe 4):
-micro insult ⁣
-micro assault⁣
-micro invalidation ⁣
-environmental Microaggression⁣
⁣
What occurred to me was a Microassault : an intentional verbal attack meant to offend me .⁣
In this case, my attempt to request a Dr to Dr  convo was met with an insult - I am a hysterical woman and need to take a tranquilizer ⁣
⁣
The Authors of the article suggest my  response should have been :⁣
ACTION (swipe 5)
⁣
-Can you tell me why you think I need a tranquilizer?⁣
-ask with curiosity ⁣
-Tell him that I was surprised and confused by his  response ⁣
-Tell him I was offended ⁣
-admit to myself how this made me feel rather than hide the fact that I was humiliated ⁣
⁣
Have any of you been on the receiving end of a work place micro aggression and if so which type ?⁣
⁣",genderbias,"|Omg, yes, very interesting post. Definitely the types of things we need to be talking about! Thanks for bringing awareness 🙏|Unbelievable. You give such great examples of how to deal with this. Thank you for being a guiding light to so many of us.|Wowza! That is mean!|Holu moly! That's crazy! I believe I would have set things straight but I can totally understand where you're coming from. We do tend to wimp out at times for many reasons.|Wow! That’s awful! These are helpful tips! I’ve experienced microinsults and microaggressions, mostly male colleagues not wanting to consult or accept transfers of my patients. I’ll try these tips next time this happens to me 👍🏽|A tranquilizer, really? Because you care about patient care? Would he have said that to a male colleague (I doubt it). Thanks for sharing this.|Omg what?? Sorry- and you rock btw. No tranquilizer needed.|Next time he wants to consult you, tell him to take a tranquilizer you’ll get there when you get there. So mad for you!! How is that considered the slightest bit professional? 🤬|I wonder if this happens in every workplace or just in the “professional” setting.  I was asked via email, “did your law school not teach you how to read?” No they didn’t actually. My kindergarten teacher did.|It's absolutely awful that you had to experience something like that! Thank you for sharing this post and providing a way to deal with these situations|I’m so sorry you went through this Hafiza. So wrong.|That’s so terrible! Thanks for sharing the tips on how to handle situations like this, I hope I will never need to use them 💕|Sorry . This happens a lore more often than it should . I often shoot back with a “right back at ya” and try to pretend that I’m joking - and that it didn’t  touch me . But who am I kidding ?|🙋‍♀️ I’ve been in the receiving in all of this many times. 
That tranquilizer comment was totally inappropriate, that shit makes me so mad, excuse my language.

It’s a little different for my position as nurses are below docs in the hierarchy of medicine, but still, inappropriate is inappropriate, and I have learned to stand up for myself and my clarifying questions. It’s always for the benefit of the patient which should be the bottom line.

I love this post so much. ❤️|I don’t even know what to say because this infuriates me to no end! No one should be talked to this way! It’s demeaning. I would have had the same response you did but then would have regretted it!|My initial response now (nitnwhen i was a new attending) woukd have been. ""Be professional."" sorry this happened to you and continues to happen to many of us in this field|Was that a typo?? Tranquilizer ?? I’m utterly disappointed|That makes me sick. Disgusting|What an ass. I’m sorry if that’s blunt. But that is a jerk move and the kind of behavior in medicine that  I’m just SO DONE with. I know how you feel Hafiza - I probably would have responded like you. But I’m working on finding my voice in the moment and pushing back. We all have to. Thanks for the reminder 👊🏻|I’ve received microaggressions from male colleagues in the past and have let them go, even though I regretted it later.  I try to make an effort to respond calmly and express my confusion, similar to what the article suggests.  Like, “tranquilizer? For what - I’m not following.” Usually causes the person to feel uncomfortable and realize what they said was offensive.|I’m so glad you posted. I’m in internal Med, and have not received direct microaggressions but have behind my back- from both male and female colleagues.|Thank you so much for posting this. Starting the conversation and being honest about how difficult it can be is so important. Seriously appreciated this today.|Thank you so much for posting this.

I’m so non confrontational I would have responded the same way and then spent hours thinking about what I should have said. I’m sorry this happened to you and thank you for sharing this|So crazy! Thanks for sharing ❤️|Oh man yes and all. Thankfully not recently but to be honest it’s hard not to have the same reaction you did.  No more though ❤️|Oh my goodness! I’m sorry you had to face that, but thank you for sharing. As a sociology minor, I am well aware of micro aggressions. I think it’s so important for us to acknowledge them and fight back, and I’m glad I know early on so I can hopefully do that once I get into medicine|What!!!?|Sorry you went through this.  microagression is a sad reality|Wow I’m so sorry that happened to you!|Wow....|Anger does begin to express my feelings at how you were treated. If he treats a peer this way, imagine his response to a female patient. And, he put it in writing - brazen.|Alright... so I am the silly clinical psychologist who took this literal. I am shocked that someone would say that. But am not surprised. Plus who says tranquillisers anymore... unless you are referring to an animal. We don’t in psychiatry anyways.

I'm so sorry you had this experience. I would have been shocked!|Unbelievable!!Sadly happens too often!so Brave of you to post this!This shouldn't be tolerated! ""You meant give tranquilizers to the patient right!"" Would be a gr8 response!|First of all, so sorry that happened to you. People can be so rude! I think it’s great you posted this, very interesting to learn about different types of microaggressions. Naming the problem is the first step!|😳I have no appropriate words. 🤬|👏🏼Yes @heart.beat.doctor this happens during training too. I have often been stuck on what I should have said. Thanks for sharing this article. I can imagine the sum of these aggressions/assaults etc. over time can cultivate and perpetuate the imposter syndrome many women physicians experience.|you are so strong for sharing this - definitely stand up for yourself next time❤️|Asking questions is a great way to call out bad behavior. The texting also gives you time. ""Is this how you talk to consultants?""|😡🤬😡|It’s taken me a while to stand up to microaggressions but I’m definitely more gutsy now than I use to be|Wow! :\|Have come across this. Thank you for sharing this Hafiza. I probably would have reacted like you did just to respect the other person. Should not really be putting up with this 😡|Thank you Ayrin ❤️|This was such a valuable post to share, so as to help empower others when in such a position. I have reacted similarly to microaggression in the past (even though I knew I should have reacted differently, by standing up for myself).|That is appalling!! I'm sorry that you have had to endure such microaggressions. I really appreciate all your recent posts, please do keep sharing! We desperately need the mentorship and guidance from women like you|I think that when we shut up, we give others the assumption that they are right ... just like Dra Casillas, I think the best way to respond is to show them how resolutive and powerful a ""hysterical"" woman can be ... I have personally decided to stop basing my own opinion on what others think of me and I have decided that my actions will speak louder :) thanks for sharing your article ..! ❤️❤️|Sorry this happened to you. It’s hard to think of a response in the moment. Thank you for these resources so we can handle these encounters better!|@heart.beat.doctor you are a strong person and so lovely women💓🤘🏻 and thanks for sharing this but i think I cannot be calm like you 🙅🏻‍♀️|“Micro”-aggression? No, there was nothing micro about it. It wasn’t hidden or indirect- he simply offended you. And that’s what he wanted. Why is it called “micro”? We shouldn’t continue to make the problem smaller than it is. Because this way we continue reacting softer than we should & keep tolerating people who feel they can behave like this! You shouldn’t have to deal with this stupidity & stupid being!|Wow.  That's my reaction and my recommendation. I've used just that one word to respond to similar comments. I've also found that the only way to deal with a bully is to push back. Wow!|Holy crap - that’s not cool. Thank you for sharing what happens all the time to so many of us 🙏🏻|This is terrible — nothing micro about it. He completely invalidated you.|This was horrible! Thank you for sharing an empowering post.|Ugh! Firstly - sorry you have to deal w this crap. But I’ve been there too. This is such a tough situation bc even if u try to “calmly” call him out & ask “why do I need a tranquilizer” it could actually further his notion that you’re hysterical. Like now you’re getting worked up about a “silly comment” he made in jest. It’s a catch 22 and I think instinctively you knew that and tried to avoid the trap by ignoring it. I can only hope that you’ll find another way to put him in his place. 
But yes - microaggressions are REAL!  We are not imagining this stuff or making it up.|Oh WOW that is not ok.|Omg 😲 Please keep sharing these. It’ll surely help others 😶|First, thank you so much for sharing something so personal but that many of us have faced. We need to shine a light on these awful situations. 2nd, thank you for showing us how we can deal with this in the future! And good for JAMA for publishing. It’s important. 3rd, I just adore you and I think you are bad ass.|Of course he would have never said that to another male physician! I once had a male pulmonologist text me and demand to know why I didn’t want to treat his patient for a positive TB. Oh and he ordered the test not me. 😠|Wow, thank you so much sharing. We have ALL faced this, myself personally from senior residents and attendings, too. I never knew how to respond either. However, I am offended this is still occurring, particularly doctor to doctor, and via text! He was in a meeting but took the time to write something rude instead of helpful? 😕|Innumerable times! From my senior residents, and consults both male and female! It took me years to get the guts to even take ACTION. It saddens me that physicians treat each other like this! Thank you for sharing this post and raising awareness about this.|Woah. Good for you for sharing this but wow tbh I don’t even understand the level of his response.|Completely inappropriate!!!!!! I think it's really challenging to respond in the moment because you are so taken aback. I would still tell to him about it now and tell him you thought it was rude and unnecessary you were simply discussing patient care and didn't warrant that type of response. It's uncomfortable to do it but you deserve to be treated respectfully. 🤗|Hafiza, I am so glad you are using this opportunity to discuss a very important topic.|Seriously? He’s in a meeting and could just say ok. What a jerk. Wish you had a stronger response. Hard in the moment. Thanks for sharing strategies.|What the?!|fantastic topic! thank you for sharing Hafiza. Micro aggression is very common and I usually deal with wimping out to avoid conflict at the time but I talk directly with the person later once I can think more clearly. no one shoud get away with it 🤨 these seemingly small insults can turn work places into hell. I think this one you experienced is a macro aggression though 😲|My blood is boiling-who does he think he is?|💖 thank you for sharing ! Didn't know this notion of microaggression... I had a obgyn in coaching dealing with older  male colleagues treating her like a little girl... ""you come I have to talk to you !!!!""... she just started not coming.. telling she had no time... they learned that it doesn't work like that with her... I encouraged her to affirm her personality and  not go when they called her that way and finally they learned to respect her and tall differently ... in these situations you feel like you no longer know what is normal and  not normal ... and without support it's difficult to respond in a constructive way... particularly when you are the newest one and the youngest... it is indeed weird that doctors have that kind of behavior but not rate at all... our training lacks the part work on yourself... though it is so so important!!! 💓its great that you have the courage to share and it's great that you're receiving so much comfort 🌹|Wow this is RIDICULOUS|Wow Hafiza. So disrespectful! I am so sorry this happened to you!|Woof we are so sorry you had to experience that. Completely uncalled for. We appreciate you sharing that though. We fear female health providers are on the receiving end of workplace agression more times that we think.|Oh yes Hafiza. I had been. So glad you are talking about this. I wish I knew how to answer before.|Thank you for using this platform to share a challenging situation.|This is absurd! Thank you for raising awareness about such an  important issue.|Thank you for sharing. I would have done the same thing and I am sure there have been so many instances that I have overlooked. Very upsetting|🤦‍♀️|Wow! It’s so hard to respond in the moment. But this is a great guide for future|Wow... thanks for sharing this and also on how to respond. It’s hard to have the proper response in the moment when you are shocked and hurt that the micro aggression has even occurred!|HAFIZA WHAT?! I am so angry on your behalf but also would have responded the same way. Some people are not worth the effort of even trying to correct and teach. I feel bad for this person but I am really grateful for you sharing and inspiring women, you are a gift to so many of us.|Omg this is infuriating|Wow. Wow. Thanks for calling this out for what it is Hafiza.|Thank you for sharing.|WOW!!! I’m not a doctor but I experience this all the time in my role. I have an older male counterpart that aggressively tells me to shut up. I’m a leader at this company. My thoughts and opinions deserve to be heard. Telling someone to shut up is not acceptable on a playground or in a corporate office.|@heart.beat.doctor 😲wow . This is a good read. I never realized you had you deal with this like this.|Wow Hafiza. Thanks for your bravery and for speaking up about this. I’m definitely been on the receiving end of micro aggression. I’m the type who’s blood boils so I have to choose my battles very carefully. 😕|Wait what?? What does that even mean? Take a tranquilizer?|Have you heard of non violent communication? I just found out about it yesterday. reading up on it|I’m in a different type of practice now but in prior jobs especially in large medical groups I experienced this type of behavior. I wish I would have been prepared to answer using the techniques you listed.|We look at things in hindsight and feel like we should have reacted differently. I'm sorry this happened to you.

I’m sorry it happened, it was so rude of him to speak to you in that way. I love the article you attached! It’s great material to have in mind.|I’ve called out male colleagues for microagressions. I’ve only had to do it twice. The first time, my coworker was soooo confused as if he had no idea that what he said was wildly inappropriate, especially in a professional setting. The second time it was actually a former boss and he took a beat and apologized. We have to speak up for ourselves. The worst is when something happens and no one else is willing to stand up for you. But that said, microagressions can just as easily come from women, which I’ve found are more difficult to deal with.|I have absolutely been subject to this over the years. The one that sticks out in mind was when I was reconsulted by an ED Attending to see a patient who was discharged over 2 weeks prior and returns with CHF exacerbation. We both were in the patient’s room. The patient was told she needed readmission. Patient was upset and ED MD said It likely would not have happened if she weren’t discharged home to soon by me. I stood in shock and carried on with the admission after he walked out. Afterwards, I confronted him professionally and told him I was shocked and appalled that he threw me under the bus in front of the patient. I asked why he said that. I told him I was disappointed in him and lost my respect for him. He then apologized and said what he said since he was not feeling well. Wow!|Hopefully there’s no next time, but if there is - you should say something. We as women are so used to letting things slide, men need to acknowledge that their female colleagues are just as capable as they are.|OMG what a 🤬🤬🤬! I cannot believe it! I don’t know how I would respond in this instance. I feel like I would have wimped out and not said anything either. But I know that would never change anything. I’m so sorry you had this happen.  You are an amazing doctor 💪🏼 and this person was way out of line.|Hey Lovely! You look so gorgeous 😍we have an awesome Surprise for you💞Send us message on Direct!👌|How unbelievable! I had to re-read the message twice as I couldn’t believe it. I don’t blame you for responding the way you did; I would’ve been shocked also and at a loss for words trying to process what the heck just happened.|That’s reprehensible! Thank you for talking about this.|😳😳😳 You know, I used to retreat from this sort of thing in the past - not wanting to escalate arguments, wanting to be the bigger person. But nowadays, toxic personalities (or even those who don't intend to be insulting, but are) are being emboldened - and I definitely will stick up for myself. I take the high road, and keep my professionalism, but would not let something like that slide without addressing it! Thank you for sharing this crazy situation with us!|Wow. That is ridiculous. Thanks for bringing light to microaggression.|This is a very hard ( and Common) problem in our work places in Mexico.

However, he was incredibly  respectful of male nurses. I competed the shadowing out of respect to my school and to represent it well. He offered me a letter of rec and I declined. I'm not even a Doctor yet (one day) and this is really sad to see. BUT it warms my heart to see so many standing together against things like this.

.
Can you let that one land for a moment? I wanted to leave adequate time for the initial flurry of posts to subside following Wanderlust before sharing these clips so they had the space deserving.
🐺
When I originally signed up as a @wanderlustgb ‘ambassador’ i knew that if I was to accept that joyful honour it would be on the premise that I use my privilege as an opening for others, to start conversations demanding a much bigger platform. I loved the entire day, it was truly a magical gathering but hosting this panel in the afternoon felt more than potent.
🐺
These clips are a few random captures (🙏 @jonelleyoga ) of a 40 minute conversation with @mollieyoga , @yogawithnikita , @leilasadeghee - on ‘Women in Yoga’. You can imagine what the entire 40 minutes was like.
🐺
Unfortunately we were derailed (for want of a better word) and didn’t quite get where we needed to. I won’t say too much about that here, yet we all felt the charge of complex trauma arising in that space and the conflict of what it is to hold space collectively for triggering yet necessary conversations, not to mention the proximate fall out.
🐺
There is so much more to say I am barely scratching the surface now and likewise on the day. This conversation was a tiny drop in an ocean impossible to traverse fully. But one thing that will stay with me is how much truth, integrity and power was present in these moments. I have huge respect and love for all of these women and their courage in speaking up with exquisite elegance and presence. I hope next year this conversation will be longer and there will be many more listening.
🐺

Thank you to all of you who attended and supported this panel and all of the feedback following. 🙏

I’m starting to try and spread the awareness of this to men as I think we equally have a role in unpacking this. I believe it all starts with awareness and conversations like this, changes to ourselves and then we can start to tackle bigger picture|I would love the conversation to continue at Exhale...?|Thank god you’ve started this conversation, would’ve loved to have seen the whole thing. It absolutely cannot wait. Think we need an intersectional feminist yoga conference, not just a single panel 💪🏼|I’ve been thinking this for a while so pleased to hear it voiced.|This is so refreshing and we are so proud to have you guys on our platform. Keel preaching 🙏🙏|This was so amazing. I could have listened all day to the 4 of you speak. Thank you so much for bringing this conversation into public light.

It’s such an important conversation and I’d like to get involved. The floor looks no different here in Barcelona. I’m going to share your post now xx|Thank you for sharing this - I wish I had been there to hear it all!
I would very much like to get involved in driving this conversation - I feel very strongly about this as I see it in all aspects of my life (yoga, journalism and everything else!) @jonelleyoga is one of my teachers and we’ve discussed this too - let me know how I can get involved x|Fabulous!|This is amazing. Is the whole conversation available anywhere?|Bloody brilliant lady. I’m all ears and support this conversation fully x|🙏|Lovely to be there and witness 🙏🏻|How did I miss this one?! Wow. Go @yogawithnikita|I would have loved to hear the musings from those present on 'what we can do about' some of the issues you raise.... I think what you've quoted here from @yogawithnikita is sadly often very true, obviously in the sense of 'shoppables'! But I also wonder, again uncomfortably, how we're ALL often unwittingly colluding with it in OUR teaching.... The 'selling' or marketing of classes, retreats etc.... It's all very cringe - but is that my patriarchal conditioning keeping me down in my place, always wanting to hide? As you alluded @naomiabsalom it is a complex Web... I think its shifting,  I feel hopeful, and conversations like these will encourage I hope 🙏|Thanks @yogawithnikita for the tag. I’m amending my comment since she explained to me what that event was about (and adding apologies for posting- when I get tagged I often make the assumption that people want me to comment). But I'll say: I'm glad these conversations are happening. At the same time I caution us about White exceptionalism and performative allyship, which it feels like we white women yogis are so drawn to. I wish there were more BIPOC on this panel (like I do in the U.S. too). Without that, it's so easy to inadvertently center white voices which has been happening in the yoga world too much. , however knowledgeable, don’t have the depth of experience and perspective on social justice that BIPOC do. One consequence is that we can get all up into optics and not realize what we’re doing or what we’re not seeing. I understand how difficult it is to cope with our own complicity, our contribution, to social inequity and injustice. What else is yoga for, than to help us do that? We can't say that ""We are all one"" and not do that work to make it so. White women make up a large % of the yoga, spiritual, and wellness worlds and yet really avoid our own inability to look at how we ARE complicit by our lack of study, inner work, awareness of intersectionality, and shadow. And I don’t think most white yoga practitioners are ready to look. We want to keep the political out. Or we want to address the political when it suits us and not when we are the subject in the problem. And that’s white privilege. Again, happy the conversation is happening. Would love to see more inclusivity and equity in how it’s happening. White people don’t need to be the primary driver or voice of this perhaps, but to take a back seat to those who already are. 🙏🏼|@lizjoyoakley @welfordwellbeing @boochikombucha|@drmilneryoga some snippets of a powerful panel discussion x|@naomiabsalom is there a recording of the full panel discussion available anywhere ?

557,"Myra Strober became a feminist on the Bay Bridge, heading toward San Francisco. It is 1970. She has just been told by the chairman of Berkeley’s economics department that she can never get tenure. Driving home afterward, wondering if she got something out of the freezer for her family’s dinner, she realizes the truth: She is being denied a regular faculty position because she is a mother. Flooded with anger, she also finds her life’s work: to study and fight sexism, in the workplace, in academia, and at home. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In a 2016 episode of the MIT Press podcast, following the publication of her memoir ""Sharing the Work,"" Myra opened up about that life-changing meeting at Berkeley, how her childhood affected her views on women in the workplace, and the stubborn challenges — and industries — that continue to hold women back. The entire episode is now up with a transcription at THEREADER.MITPRESS.MIT.EDU (article: ""An Economist's Fight for Equity in the Workplace""). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

561,"I’m getting lots of messages from men. 
That have suffered abuse.

And they are doing a lot of their healing in silence, and confusion. 
The cognitive dissonance, or confusion I had trying to process what I had conceived of as normal behavior, as actually being abusive behavior, as a female I am realizing must be extremely crippling for men. 
Men don’t get abused. 
Men are too strong to be abused. 
Men can’t be weak. 
Men have to be strong. 
This is cultural conditioning, and it needs to stop. 
Men, all men, even abusive men are sentient beings. They have feelings, a soul, desires and they also have the right to those- any of them. If you really take a deep dive into it, most abusive men were victims of abuse themselves and their healing was probably cut off because our culture denies them the right to access and express their feelings.

This anger turned inward is why we see a rise in addictions, narcissism and other abusive behaviors- we tell them first, you’re not a victim and if you are, you’d better shut that down- men don’t cry. 
We literally expect them to live in delusion. To shut themselves off from their feelings. 
Let’s change the conditioning: 
Men can be victims. 
Men are victims. 
Men can cry. 
Men can be weak. 
Men can break down. 
Men can do yoga. 
Men can meditate. 
And men can heal. 
But you cannot heal until your pain gets validated. You cannot heal until you are able to go there with those feelings, to take the dive to access, explore and reconstruct these traumas, these violations. You cannot heal until you’re validated that it’s ok to have been abused, to have been weak. 
Just because a man has a penis doesn’t mean he should be denied any of the real avenues to owning his abuse and owning his healing. 
This is where generational trauma stops- when we give women and men each the right to own their ability to heal themselves.",genderbias,|You have a way of cutting through the fluff and pulling out the truth.

565,"Can women do specific exercise to lose weight on their thighs? Or belly or hips or whatever body part.
.
.
We still get this question from so many people, and all the videos and ""tutorials"" on this topic by popular health and beauty social media channels only make it worse by perpetuating this myth. But wait, is it a myth?
.
.
Can women actually do specific exercises to lose fat in specific body parts? Let's break it down.
.
.
Yes, you can do specific exercises to lose fat. But not just at that body part. Fat loss happens throughout the body and we don't have a natural way of controlling where we lose how much fat.
.
.
Based on our genetics 🧬, activity 🏋️‍♀️, nutrition 🥙, sleep 😴 and stress 😫 we all store fat in different parts of the body and in different proportions. While it would be great to control where to gain and lose fat, the body doesn't work that way and anyone telling you otherwise or selling pills, potions or a workout programme to spot-reduce fat is simply scamming you.
.
.
If you want to lose fat, irrespective of where in your body that is, start by working out, sleeping more and eating better. Do this consistently for a few months and you'll see that the fat disappears while so many other good things in your life start to appear.
.
.
And in case you're wondering, the above is true no matter what your gender is! The biased lens of gender makes it harder for women to pursue health and fitness goals in peace. So please do your part by not spreading unverified information about gender based differences in training and nutrition. And of course, by sharing sensible, verified information like this post. .

Is not this word very common with us , to draw a boundary since we were kid ? .
⛔You are a baby girl , play with doll? . ⛔You are a girl don't you have to laugh so louder? ⛔ What will you do with all these long studies ?
 Anyway you have to maintain family and raise kids? ⛔ Don't be much demanding ⛔ You are not allowed to go at night , alone? ⛔You are not allowed to have fun with mix crowd ⛔You are not allowed to tell about your heavy blood flow or show your stains , if you have menstual problem? ⛔ Oh girl, you are girl and you are not allowed to express your physical desire? ⛔You are not allowed to prose first? ⛔You are not allowed to stay single after 30 ⛔You are not allowed to be fat, you are not allowed to be black, you are not allowed to be skinny ????????? Who you are??? Why sooo many boundaries only for you??? Why you can't laugh ,cry , live exactly like your male friends, your brothers , your fathers?????? . . .

You are beautiful the way you are. You are the mother,  the sister, the lover , the wife ....... Choose your life and make a  new society for yourself . Don't make boundaries to cut your wings, fly the sky and conquer the World.....

584,"Unladylike?? .
A friend of mine, a gentleman, remarked that a certain lady was 'manly' because she dominated her team and lacked any 'nazakat' 🙄🤔🤔
.
.
To which I replied that it's not only nazakat or physical sophistication that defines women. After all look at athletes like Hima Das and Serena Williams.
.
The answer I got was shocking. 'yes they too are not at all like women ' .
.
That makes me wonder, dude which century do you live in? .
A woman is labelled manly or unladylike because she isn't demure ,shy, hesitant and lacking voice. .
The disparity between genders doesn't stop there. Any man who likes cooking or enjoys using make-up is called 'girly'.
.
So apparently being a girl is an insult for the macho. .
I wonder if a gender neutral world would be better after all. Where we wouldn't judge or look down upon others who don't live by gender norms.

If research and affluent reports are indicative of terrestrial humans, Sheryl Sandberg was one of the worlds most powerful women and Mark Zuckerberg is 6x more powerful. I am saying w/o bias Sheryl Sandberg is the most powerful woman, terrestrial speaking. She may have some strategic brand informatics. Cool. Great. WoW a geo-synchronized satellite direct access uplink. Huemantechnologies put enough mass in outfits, she got planetary gravitational force. #STITCHxSTITCH. Our information suggests she has enough brand influence in terms of value. Less than 90 percentile of recognized Countries. Much less. Much less. That's before she starts working. Before she leaves her house. If Sheryl wants to be happy joyful and in love that's up to her. Never the less, women nor men haven't even fully unpacked what a force like planetary gravidity can do and effect. ""The ultimate luxury is to combine passion with contribution. Also a clear path to happiness"" Sheryl's words. Huemantechnologies thinks that is an adequate explanation for talent acquisition as well. We established the traditional and professional and means; and in response to your Maire Claire article. Unfortunately no explanation for the most efficient and fastest is available. Such information is restricted. Fortunately we can say Why?  Speaking from a Huemantechnologies platform, it ran her through our metrics. Energy, acquisitions, passions. Hmmmm… #internp1|…#.internp3 #textile #Love #pointedbodylanguage #2018 #election #cycle #splcenter #Huemantechnologies #product #service #simulation Equals why. Plus, pretty interesting cross multi-displines cross hatching occurring throughout. Given, for example in metrices her orthographic output and a comparison inquiry of the same labeled output. We determined that she was the one. A broad scope composite was used. Unfortunately the metric itself is restricted. I will indicate, material reference nomenclature such Gates, Bezos, coaches, mentors, leaders cognitive-behavioral stuff used. Plus some of my personal idiosyncratic criteria building stuff. Huemantechnologies needs her ambition, qualifications, performance, heart, and some of her idiosyncratic stuff. Huemantechnologies is very, or can be very persuasive.  Hmm.. ambition, qualifications, performance, and....heart. If my life existed exactly as I commanded, this comment doesn't exist. Trust me. Fortunately in a reverse and predictable curser to myself and Huemantechnologies and our kentics in talent acquisitions, some will have to wait there turn. Like me and some 20 other humans.

Your correct about when ensuring the survivability of female and women initiatives. One is the least in strength. And certainly a ill conceived goal if successful return of female lead roles within female codified and women initiatives. You guys pooled six this round. Where do you think the flatting occurred with the DNC now? if debates was charged by humans, and you guys pooled 6 humans to start with. If the primary goal is to have a presidential candidate and succession of proportional return year after year, How do you now keep the fire burning to ensure the torch continually burns for future event-related, time-related and topic&category related occurances? Perhaps the reason that the pop-for-shizzle dizzle ambience decreased because in a sensational and identity socioecon-poltical landscape a lack of single identity and sensational direction didn't occur from the DNC side. That's okay because at the end of the day a mimium number of senate and rep seats are needed for a complete sweep. you guys have the resources, fiances and wherewithal to accomplish a clean swept election.

594,"Remember where we came from, and where we are headed. This might be the most valuable thing I’ve learned since finishing training:  women in medicine need to lift each other up. We need to raise our voices in support of each other, in support of our lgbtq2sia kin, and of our culturally diverse kin. 
Patriarchal values are very much alive and well in surgery, and lack of mentorship and, even more so, sponsorship for women and minorities persists.  Here are some suggestions for ways to incorporate a little bit of feminism into your practice during training and early career: 
1. Join a society repping women and minorities. In Orthopaedics we have the RJOS (Ruth Jackson Orthopaedic Society) but there are countless others. 
2. Search and follow women and minorities in medicine and science on social media platforms. This gives us a voice. 
3. Read up on recent publications about gender bias in surgery and medicine. There have been a fair few recently. 
4. When discussing barriers to women in medicine, please consider things other than pregnancy, children, and family life.  Assuming these are the only issues reinforces bias. 
6. Call out bias when you see it but educate, don’t berate. 
5. Be unapologetically feminine, masculine or undecided if that’s who you are, because somebody out there needs a mentor who is unapologetically like them. 
6. People who identify as genders other than men are experience imposter syndrome more frequently. Let me be one to tell you that you absolutely deserve to be where you are, and you do know what you are doing. Do the world a favour and apply for positions, grants, scholarships, and opportunities in abundance.  We need more than just seats at the table, but it’s a start. #genderbias #lgbtq #diversity

""The endgame is clear: Bank of America wants the women out of power at Alex and Ani,"" the company says in the lawsuit.
.
Alex and Ani alleges in the lawsuit that Bank of America has a ""checkered past"" with respect to gender bias in lending and that ""it is perhaps unsurprising what happened after a triumvirate of strong women"" took control at the company.
.
Alex and Ani, founded in 2004, has 104 store locations, most of them in the United States, and also sells it jewelry at hundreds of other authorized retailers including Nordstrom and The Paper Store.
.
Rafaelian was listed 22nd in Forbes America’s Richest Self-Made Women in 2016, with net worth estimated at $700 million in June 2016. As of June 2018, Rafaelian is estimated to be worth $1 billion, and 18th on the Forbes list of America's richest self-made women, owning 80% of Alex and Ani.",genderbias,|#alexandani #jewelery #lawsuit #carolynrafaelian #genderbias #bankofamerica #genderdiscrimination #discrimination #powerfulwomen|Wow|Go for it|What a disgrace,93
0,"Do you know that 1 in 7 people suffer from migraines? This means over 1 billion people globally or nearly 15 percent of the world population!

Do you know that migraines are 3 times more common in women than in men too?

Τhey are the second cause of a neurological disability and the sixth most debilitating condition globally in terms of years lost to disability!

Even though migraines do not shorten people’s lives, they affect work and family life in terms of ability to function during attacks and lost work days. They are still, however, highly stigmatized, under diagnosed, and under treated!

September is the World’s Alzheimer’s month and this week (September 1-7) is dedicated to Migraines. Let’s celebrate and educate the world about this debilitating disorder during this Migraine Awareness Week!

And let’s start respect migraines!!! Check out our article on Migraines on our website (link on our profile) and below: 👉 http://www.womensbrainproject.com/migraine-facts-migraine-awareness-week-2019/

2,"🚻⁣The gender disparity and diagnostic delay🚻⠀
⠀
A 2015 study revealed that women experienced a longer lag time from the onset of cancer symptoms to diagnosis in six out of the eleven types of cancer studied. A 2013 study concluded that ✨twice✨ as many woman as men had to make over 3 appointments to a general practitioner or family doctor before being referred to a specialist for suspected bladder cancer. A similar finding is seen with renal cancer.⠀
⠀
Women are more often deemed suffering from psychological disorders. It took an average of 12 months for men to get diagnosed with Crohn’s disease compared to 20 months for women😑. Men were diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 4 years compared to women’s 16 years😥⠀
⠀
I believe there are many factors to why this exists. Women are often seen as complainers, and symptoms, especially when vague lab tests or examinations come back ""normal"", are often dismissed. Women are also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses. But the fact is, ⁣women are less likely to have their pain treated, their symptoms taken seriously or to be given a diagnosis than men. ⠀
⠀
My point is not to blame doctors for their wrongdoings, prejudices, or biases, but to bring awareness to this issue. Each year, an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 people die due to diagnostic errors in the US alone. I know way too many women that have had dismissive and even condescending experiences with healthcare professionals and need to know that this is a wide spread issue and entirely not their fault or it's ""all in their head"".⠀

For instance they love to interact with themselves, even hold each other’s hands, etc. they have strong bonds that can lead in bad directions if they are unknowledgeable and just like each other’s presence. Treating women as if they are just there for their enjoyment. It’s lunatics. Getting free drinks or meals isn’t business if it stops there. Let’s do business. None of that corrupt ish either.

.
The first post of our #MythbustingMonday series is here! Why is it that women are branded as “hormonal”, when hormones are simply essential to human functioning? Evidence from the field of neuroscience shows that the male hormone testosterone has a detrimental effect on the cognitive ability to assess risk (an essential aspect of leadership). Plus, studies show that men and women have an equal ability to be logical in decision making!

The male gender is always given an edge at work place while the female gender is passed on from promotions since employers worry they may leave after getting married and having kids...
Giving a few examples of women empowerment is not enough...
Most women still face gender bias all life long...
Just because we choose the greater good over selfish gains does not mean we don't deserve to be treated equally...
Women deserve equal opportunities...
Girls deserve to be taught Financial Independence, Career Responsibility and how to focus on Professional Growth...
Boys need to be taught being a Bread Maker, not just a Bread Earner...
Kids should be raised equally and that is the only way we will progress as a society...

18,"A little background:
My ex and I share 50/50 custody. She left a 70k a year job to sit at home smoking weed, collecting govt benefits and living off her rapper/drug dealer bf. So because she claims to have no income and a total disability (despite clubbing every weekend and working under the table as a hairdresser), I pay both MY financial obligations to my daughter, as well as my exes. 
She wants $600 a month. And childcare, despite having no job. 
I had several hearings where I was made to feel like a deadbeat because I pointed out discrepancies in her financial disclosure. 
I have had to hire a lawyer that I cannot afford in order to argue the obvious, but it has finally paid off, and now I've been granted all of the exes financial information. 
It sucks that the courts force you to go broke paying a lawyer simply to seek a fair family court process, essentially forcing fathers into financial insolvency simply to ensure they can support their kids in their OWN home.
If I were working under the table, shirking my responsibility to my child, the courts would come down on me with the wrath of God. But if a female does the same, she's ""just doing her best"". .

34,"I so enjoyed reading this story.  This is a global movement!  @unwomenaust Meet Christine Wambulwa, smashing gender stereotypes in Kakuma, Kenya as the only female mechanic.

Every day, by 7.30 a.m., she is at the vehicle repair shop along the highway. “I don’t have a weekend,” she says. “If someone has a vehicle break-down in the middle of the road, or in the bush, at any time, I will go. I like this job too much.” Christine grew up in Kakuma town watching her brothers. “When the boys made toy cars, I made toy cars, when they looked after cattle, I too looked after cattle. I thought I was a boy just like them!” When she grew older, there was not enough money to educate her and the family had many mouths to feed. She learned to repair vehicles. “The first vehicle I repaired was a Toyota lorry,” she says. “In the beginning, it was a little hard, I had to carry heavy things. But now we have better machines to lift heavy things.” Christine believes that women can do anything that men can do. But there are still some challenges in her line of work. ""Men don’t believe that a woman can repair a vehicle. A man will think ten times before giving me a vehicle to repair,” she admits.

That doesn’t stop Christine from doing the work she likes doing. She is the sole breadwinner of her family since her husband’s death. She is putting her own children through school and supporting her brothers and sisters too. “With the refugees, more opportunities have come too,” she says. “Things have opened up a little— there are more women drivers now. Earlier, very few girls went to school in this area. The culture was the main factor holding them back. But now many girls go to school—girls from Kakuma town and the refugee camp.” Christine’s message to other women: “Do not fear. Work is work. Nothing’s hard for a woman, it’s only in the mind.” -

36,"Last year I shaved my head. I was turning 30, was unhappy with the health of my hair (I had bleached it A LOT), and wanted a “fresh start.” So I went for it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was prepared for some people to look at me sideways, but I was NOT prepared for the depth of how many people would struggle with it. Friends, clients, complete strangers...I don’t think a day went by where someone wasn’t confused by me.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I no longer fit into their gender box so neatly. “So, are you a lesbian? Do you have cancer? Why did you do that?” People constantly asked me super invasive questions, as if they had a right to my energy, my personal info, my time...completely entitled to an explanation about why I didn’t fit into their idea of what a “woman” should be.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And all the while I was physically experiencing freedom, which felt super confusing to feel like my freedom/comfort/groundedness was causing everyone else to feel deeply uncomfortable...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It was an eye opener. I hadn’t understood my cisgender privilege until I gave a little bit of it up. I’m eternally grateful for the experience, as I feel like I have a teeny tiny experiential piece of what it might be like to live outside of the gender binary.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So next time you feel curious about someone’s gender/sexuality/identity, maybe just sit with that curiosity 🥴⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Maybe the urge to relieve the discomfort of not knowing is something that belongs to YOU to sit with, and not something that you actually have a right to know...maybe the discomfort of the unknown is not something you should hand to the other person. Maybe allow your relationship to develop to a point where they might feel inspired to share with you. Maybe ask for permission before asking deeply personal questions.

53,"The word “scientist” does not specify a gender. And yet, ever since conferences and symposiums emerged from the primordial academic soup — the majority of prominent scientific speakers and panelists have been men. This phenomenon has been documented in many studies and spawned mocking monikers. “Oh no, not another manference!” “Did you go to that himposium?"", and so forth. On June 12, 2019 (seriously, 2019!), the effort to achieve better gender balance has a new champion: the long-standing director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins. Dr. Collins sent a clear message of concern: ""It is time to end the tradition in science of all-male speaking panels”. His announcement was applauded by scientists who have long urged speaker diversity at conferences.
.
I can personally attest to the fact that out of every 10 speakers giving a prominent talk at any given conference, the female to male ratio is easily 1:9. My direct experience is limited to Alzheimer's, brain aging, and neuroscience conferences (which nonetheless means tens of thousand of people) -- but while I wish more women were keynoting in other fields, my non-Alzheimer's colleagues report the same dismaying stats. Most speakers are male (and white male, at that). But then, most lab directors are male. Most grant awardees are male. Most tenured professors are male.
.
It is no wonder then that we have an enormous gender-bias in science and research, not just in terms of who's running it, but also in terms of what's been studied. Women have been left out of research until the mid-1990's!
.
Certainly men are wonderful contributors to the biomedical enterprise -- and it's never about women without men, or women instead of men! It's about acknowledging that there’s a tendency to neglect that lots of women also contribute to research. Dr. Collins said he will no longer speak at conferences that don't ensure adequate gender representation. I hope that more male scientists will feel inspired to do the same!

When it comes to women and their healthcare, we are still years behind. Large gender gaps in medical research have led to gaps in knowledge about how to diagnose, treat and care for women and their health. At WAM, we are raising funds to support gender and sex based research in Alzheimer’s, a disease that disproportionately impacts women. Two out of three brains with Alzheimer’s belong to women and no one knows why that is. Help us pave the way towards women’s equality, not only in the workplace, culture, government, but also in healthcare! 💪 #womensequalityday",genderbias,|#billiejeanking #womensequality #equalityforall #equalrightsforall #womensrightsarehumanrights #19thamendment #votingrights #healthcareequity #healthcareequality #womenshealth #womenshealthcare #womensrightsmatter #genderequality #sexbasedresesearch #genderbias #genderbiased #alzheimersresearch #alzheimersawareness #alzheimersprevention #alzheimers #womensbrainhealth #brainhealth #WAM #womensalzheimersmovement|💪🏼👌🏼👌🏼,304

65,"""Suffering with joy."" I heard this phrase yesterday on the radio and it so clearly summarized what I believe the expectation is for women with chronic illness. Sweep your pain, exhaustion, confusion and well-justified anger under the rug for the comfort of everyone else. It comes as no surprise that society would expect women to consistently display a good-natured disposition; this is a normative gender expectation. However, the pressure to ""find joy in the journey"" graduates to magnificent proportions for women who have chronic illness. Every day, I am bombarded by Memes, inspirational posts and cliched representations of chronic illness. These are targeted toward women! They have pastel colors, feature adorable animals and are packaged in ways that are supposed to appeal to females. They make me cringe. I feel no guilt about my anger regarding chronic illness. I am entitled to be mad, sad, envious, depressed, cranky and every other emotion that feels authentic. I've been through some cataclysmic torture and that deserves recognition. So, I just want to encourage all of the women out there to feel safe in expressing the full spectrum of emotions.

⠀
Physiologically we have different levels of hormones〽, a 30-40% increase in blood volume🎈, different metabolic rates🍝, and cardiovascular function💗. It’s no surprise that medications work differently in men and women’s bodies.⠀
⠀
In 1989 the Physician’s Health Study enrolled 22,071 people (all men) to see if low dose aspirin lowered the risk of heart attacks in men over 50. This same experiment ✨wasn’t✨ conducted on women until 16 years later and concluded that aspirin had no effect on heart disease risk for those under 65, but did help those over the age of 65, in addition to reducing the risk of stroke, a benefit not found in the the male only study. Had the original study included women, these findings would have changed the way heart disease💔 and stroke were treated in women.⠀
⠀
Women have a greater risk than men of developing dangerous heart arrhythmia💓 that can be triggered by various drugs such as antibiotics, antidepressants, and cholesterol lowering drugs. Beta blockers have been shown to have a stronger effect on women than men. Women respond better to SSRI’s (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) than tricyclic antidepressants💊 while the opposite is true for men. Women suffer from more side effects of anesthesia during surgeries and medical procedures🏩 and generally wake up faster than men due to metabolic differences.⠀
⠀
After 700 reports of patients getting into car accidents🚘 the morning after taking the approved drug 🚫zolpidem🚫 (the active ingredient in Ambient), the FDA decreased the regulated dose for women. Had the original study included women, it may have been discovered that women took longer to clear the drug from their bodies, and hundreds of injuries and deaths could have been prevented.⠀
⠀
There is so much about society where I revere the concept of equality between genders, but with healthcare and medical treatment, careful attention needs to be made between sexes so safe and appropriate treatment can be applied.⠀

The Man
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
That would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes you
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?

And they would toast to me or let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

Would you like to worry about drinkin' and dollars?
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars I'd be a bitch not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that) And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
And I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man 
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man 
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

I'd be the man
I'd be the man

If I was a man, I'd be the man

یکی از سوگیری های ذهنی که در گفتگو اتفاق میفته، پیش داوری هاییه که افراد نسبت به جنس مرد یا زن دارند.
اغلب ما از کودکی در خانواده و بستر جامعه، حرفهایی درباره جنس زن یا مرد شنیدیم که الگوی ذهنی ما رو شکل دادند. بطوریکه در حین گفتگو حرفهای همدیگه رو به زن بودن یا مرد بودن ربط میدیم.
گاهی قضیه به اینجا میرسه که تا حرف کسی رو نمیتونیم با استدلال و با منطق پاسخ بدیم، در جواب میگیم： شما زن ها فلانید، یا شما مردها بهمانید. غافل ازینکه اینگونه پاسخ ها گفتگو رو به بن بست میکشونه؛ چراکه سوگیری های ذهن مون درباره جنس زن یا مرد اجازه نمیده حرف همدیگه رو اونطور که هست، بشنویم.

83,"The likability trap is the idea that to be perceived in a positive light, women have to be viewed as ""likable"" first - when women behave assertively or out of self-interest (behaviors deemed appropriate attributes for leadership), they're often viewed as bitchy or cold — both of which lead to poorer workplace outcomes. ⁣
⁣
Yet, when women lead with warmth, they can be perceived as less competent or less “leader-like” — it’s a ‘damned if we do, doomed if we don’t scenario’
⁣
In her @nytimes Joan C. Williams suggests that, to overcome the likability backlash, women can try to do something masculine in a feminine way.⁣
⁣
She says: ""Think of femininity as a toolkit, and choose something that feels authentic to you. But don’t choose deference. One study found that women who used a submissive conversational style, apologizing and hedging, just undercut themselves...""⁣
⁣
This still feels unfair and let's be honest, emotionally exhausting, though I can see why it would be effective.⁣
⁣
Let's discuss... ⁣
⁣
◽️ Should women have to find the ""just right"" mix of assertiveness and warmth to be taken seriously as leaders? ⁣
⁣
◽️ Where does authenticity come into play? ⁣

◽️ What do you think of the suggestions included above and what’s worked for you?⁣

In our world, we still have stereotypes people who want the boy to be firstborn or there should be a boy to take family name ahead. So, what do you think about this? 
Children come to the world in the same way, the difference is only how we raise them.
Generally, by the age of 3, children understand their own gender and difference between male and female bodies. We should teach them its only biological difference not mentally, emotionally or physically.
Both boys and girls can learn to do all kinds of chores and share the same responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, caring for younger brothers and sisters, and using tools and machines. Don’t assign genders to activities and objects. 
Dhivija loves to play pretend play of daycare with all stuff toys and as well as love to play with cars and get dirty in the sand.

Gender equality helps us know that boys and girls have the right to be treated the same until they can decide how they want to represent themselves. We can gift this to a child - a new little person who will grow into a beautiful person inside and out. A girl can also take family name ahead and make everyone proud.

When we have the same curriculum and subjects in school for both boys and girls and then why we raise them differently at home?

Let's try to understand that a boy could love pink and girl could be crazy of blue. Let's accept that masculinity and femininity resides in everyone of us. Men too look cute when they feel shy and women can look damn brave with a sword.

May be equality couldn't solve the problems but ""the right to do what you desire"" could. And that's what freedom is... So let's break these boundaries so that either your boy could play with a barbie or your girl can have a toy car❣❣ #unequality #inequality #genderbias #nogenderbias #nogenderrules #letsbethechange #breakingtheboundaries #righttodesire #brightfuture #takeforwardthegood #righttodream #righttoexpress #breaktheethics #liveasyoulove #liveasyouwant",genderbias,"|Awww😍|Joe, you could actually start a page to put all these..they r really touching🔥💯❤️",34

Today is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day. It marks how far into 2019 Black women have to work to catch up with what white men earned in 2018 alone. ⁣
⁣
For millions of women, the pay gap is painfully real. But many people don’t even know that it exists. New research from @LeanInOrg and @SurveyMonkey has found that one in three Americans aren’t aware of the pay gap between Black women and white men. Even fewer are aware of the pay gap between Black women and white women, which — though smaller — is still sizeable.⁣
⁣
On average, the pay gap for Black women amounts to nearly a million dollars in lost earnings over the course of a career. That’s huge. And missing out on that income doesn’t just hurt women. It also hurts their families. More than 80% of Black mothers are breadwinners for their households. Being paid less means less money for groceries, housing, childcare, and tuition. ⁣
⁣
These numbers are a powerful reminder that we still have a long way to go before our economy and our country are truly fair and equal. Fighting for gender equality means fighting for all women, especially those who face bigger obstacles and fewer opportunities. That’s what today is all about. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay",genderbias,|Black Woman need equal pay,55
97,"#BlackWomensEqualPayDay falls on August 22nd this year. White women make on average 80 cents on the dollar as compared with white men, while black women make on average just 63 cents on the dollar, according to PayScale.
⠀⠀
That means black women have to work about an additional 142 days to make what white women make and about 215 days to make what white men earn in a year. Is this fair?
⠀⠀
Not paying black women the same for equal work impacts all of us, affecting our workplaces, our communities and our economy. That’s because:
⠀⠀
80 percent of black women are the primary breadwinners.
Black women represent 53 percent of the black labor force, while women overall account for about 47 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The number of businesses owned by black women has surged by 164 percent, which is nearly three times the rate of growth for women-owned businesses overall.
Black women are also the most educated group in the US, with women making up 64 percent of black students who earn bachelor’s degrees.
There are many factors perpetuating the wage gap across gender and race, from lack of sponsors and pathways to advancement to stereotypes and biases. - via @forbes

105,"GENDER BIAS IN MEDICINE

An article was published this month in Academic Emergency Medicine.

And it found something I know I have felt more than once during residency: the boys are treated differently (better) than the girls.

We always teased our two male co-residents about ""the power of the penis"". Not to take away from their amazing abilities, but they both got to sit at the robot sooner, did more in cases earlier in our careers, and seemed to garner more respect and confidence from everyone around them, especially the nurses.

So it was no great surprise to see the conclusion of this study that looked at gender bias in nursing evals of EM residents: ""Despite the lack of difference in ABILITY or COMPETENCE as measured by in-service exam scores and milestone evaluations, nurses evaluate female residents lower in their abilities and work ethic as compared to male residents."" Ouch.

@nataliecrawfordmd has talked about some of these issues in her #asawoman podcast and shared stories of other women experiencing the same. It has touched all of us. But it was startling (and disheartening) to see the data show it too.

GENDER BIAS IS REAL FOLKS. And some of the worst bias is coming from other women.

I get it and have been guilty myself. Men have a natural ability to instill confidence and lead and they dominated medicine for its early years.

But #thefutureisfemale ladies and we allll gotta check our own subconscious biases at the door and SUPPORT OTHER WOMEN.

So I am not at all surprised that nurses would feel more negatively about female residents - I would bet they probably would have scored them low even if not comparing to men. I am not sure the exact etiology of this but I suspect it has something to do with the gender bias, patriarchal culture, and the sort of dog eat dog attitude that sometimes we have to have to survive as females not afforded the same privilege as males in our society and workplaces... definitely needs to change!|I love the awareness and this is about to help me write a essay in college!

We were told of all kinds of things: 'your dad used to hit you'; 'your dad used to do this…' You don’t remember any of this happening but you start to believe it because otherwise why would anyone tell their children that? Then - that was it. No contact. She took the relationship away out of spite against him. She had the biggest weapon of all and she used us against him."" - Sarah

Even though she was a narcissist and abusive, he was never given the rights he deserved. He fought for custody in court and was granted weekend visitations and then ten days a month, a right his ex-girlfriend did not honour. She would play games and make EVERY single child exchange extremely difficult and toxic, exposing their child to undue stress, blaming him in the process."" - Girlfriend of an alienated dad

https://bit.ly/2HitHZP

There came a time when my mom, likely fueled by her anger towards her husband and her own mental health issues, sat me down and told me I had a biological father. After everything she had put me through and subjected me to, she decided to unleash this on me as if to intentionally cause pain and emotional suffering. When I had questions, she told me dramatic tales of a drug addicted man who held a knife to my throat when I was a baby, who beat her repeatedly in front of me and my brother, and who was so incredibly evil, that she had no other choice but to completely cut him out of our lives."" - Victim of alienation and an abusive stepfather

108,"Gender bias in leadership in GI .
.
Women in gastroenterology are also less likely to hold institutional leadership positions. A study published in 2017 revealed that only 7% of gastroenterology division chiefs and 18% of gastroenterology program directors were women.
.
.
This trend continues in gastroenterology national societies. In fact, there have only been 17 women presidents since the inception of the four gastroenterology societies, ASGE, AGA, AASLD, and ACG. .
.
This disparity also extends to private practice and endoscopy ownership. A 2008 study revealed that women were less likely than men to own an endoscopy center (29% vs. 54%; P=0.03) or their own practice (50% vs. 75%; P<0.02).
.
.
While the statistics remain discouraging, it is important to recognize that the gender trend in leadership is slowly changing. In fact, in 2017 the presidents of all 4 national GI societies were women! .
.
As a fellow entering the field, I’m so excited to see the gender shift as more women take leadership positions. .
.
These role models serve as great mentors to future aspiring physicians. I strongly believe that with strong support and camaraderie among women the gender gap within gastroenterology can ultimately be closed.

It is time that doctors are educated properly in bias training, that women are included in studies (especially if the issues are for conditions that are women’s issues!), and that no matter your race or gender, you are listened to and treated! For more information on gender and racial bias, please head to our website. And to help fund research to understand more about gender based differences, please donate in the link in our bio! With your help, we can understand more, and with everyone’s cooperation, we can help educate more on the biases in the medical field and make going to see the doctor not as scary a proposition. Everyone deserves the chance to be listened to, and we want to help make that happen! #motivationmonday",genderbias,"|Watched his show.

123,"Happy BACK TO SCHOOL WEEK!
📚 ✏️ 📝 
Missing out as a father. Being cut out your children life is painful. August has never been a good month for me. Death of my family always on or around my birthday. 
I ruined a neighbor’s day, who had just taken some pics of his own little ones for the first day of school. I just got home too a nap it was really all I could do to not burst into tears, knowing how pathetic I looked.

Empty bedroom. No hair to brush. No mouth to feed. No body to hug. No spirit to encourage. No listening to our favorite songs or conversation in the car. No tearing up as they go too class waved goodbye.

But trust me, there are still tears — made it back inside just in time. 😞

126,"Women have long been kept on a pedestal...
We were raised with a constant reminder of needing a husband one day, even before we understood the complexities of relationships...
We have been constantly asked to raise out self worth for others image and status, but we are ridiculed if we prioritize our own self esteem...
We are called selfish for wanting a career over marriage, yet called useless when we choose to be homemakers...
We are either trying too hard to look good and attract men, or we are not worthy enough for men when we choose self love and body positivity...
We are tagged wannabes if we archive our own glory, while those who want a man to make their dream come true are tagged gold diggers...
It is high time we climb down from this unfair pedestal, pick a ladder for ourselves and climb up to our own destinations...
Let the madness crumble behind you as you walk away from things that hold you back...
You are capable of Creation of all kinds and you must never confine your magical powers just because the World isn't ready for Your BRILLIANCE...

127,"Hey'all! 💜
I'm delighted to see lots of new faces around here - many of you found me through Friday's blog post about teachers and gender bias. So glad you're here! .
.
🤔You might be wondering, what is Think or Blue? Well, if you're not a word play fan like me, it's a play on our culture's obsession with labeling babies in the womb with #pinkorblue. There's nothing wrong with finding out your future child's sex, but the expectations we attach to it are more and more narrow. Tiaras or Trucks? Touchdowns or Tutus? Blech!
.
.
You get the idea. It feels a little stifling. We've forgotten the layered complexity of all children. ✔️Think or Blue is here to bring parents, relatives, and teachers together to take a critical look at these gender stereotypes that we just can't seem to escape. And move into a world where our kids can embrace their individuality and create a more compassionate society.
.
.
And who the heck am I? 😎I'm Catherine, I live in Connecticut with my almost 4 year-old and have been obsessed with gender equity and feminism since long before she was born. But her existence crystallized for me the need to quash gendered expectations once and for all. So we can let our children be themselves.

Some of my favorite things include dark chocolate, Gilmore Girls, my family, Paramore, smashing diet culture, becoming more anti-racist, painting with my kid, and dance parties. Oh, and the occasional mojito.

I'm excited to work with you to forge a world where children feel confident on the inside and out, and are ready to change the world! 🌎Who's with me??
.
.
.
P.S. I have lots of free resources linked in my bio so check it out: a body image guide, a 5 day email course for raising confident girls, the feminist parenting resource library, and 7 ways to parent without stereotypes. Hope you find them helpful.

What can YOU do? 1️⃣. Ask your colleague to explain her thinking. For example, you can say, “Generally, I think we like ambition as a company. Why does it bother you in this case?” 2️⃣. You can also suggest that there may be a double standard at work by saying something like, “How do you feel when a man on your team asks for a promotion?” ⁠

Then you have the several written documents from the various oral traditions. 
Then you have the interpretative sermons from the various documents.
Then you have the rise of the most popular documents.
Then you have the councils that decide which is the only authoritative canon.

Even in this cartoon is the assumption that there is no mention off women disciples in the New Testament, whereas in 40 years off study, I’ve found the female narrative to be the most compelling. The story off the Prodigal Son is actually about Mary, Marty and Lazarus and first told in their presence to restore their relationship. We really have too read the Word without patriarchal eyes, most especially those of us who claime to reject it.|Your description here. This is why I left the church.  To base your entire life and filter all of your spiritual experiences through a book that came together in such a process thousands of years ago...
AND the way women are portrayed and treated...|Glory to God for all women deacons, priests and bishops in the Anglican Communion 🙏🏻.|I struggled with this a lot and approached the Bible with open hands about the topic but found some beautiful studies about the way woman were included in the early church and how their roles actually increased (as well as some unfortunate mention of when a woman's name was likely omitted). The Blue Parakeet by Scot McKnight really opened my eyes and encouraged me that woman don't just deserve a place of leadership in the church, but also how the Bible actually gives us reason to believe so. I would highly recommend the read to anyone struggling with similar questions.|Thank you for this. So much.|@glennondoyle @realrobbell Up your alleys. 🙌🏼|Love this!🙌|This was the exact thing that triggered my deconstruction. More and more things came up over time, but this particular point was the seed. ❤️|But your way is a good reason to dismiss it ;)|@christablackgifford|Most rabbis at the time had 12 followers. Not just Jesus and women were not allowed to be disciples of any of the rabbis because they weren't even allowed in the synagogue.  It's the culture that's sexist, not the Bible. In fact the Bible is brilliant at raising up women in such a degrading culture.|@merienearaujo|So interesting reading these comments of discussion on this question/idea that @nakedpastor brought up with this drawing. Loving the different perspectives on this one and learning about some of the different tradition within Christianity and how women are viewed and respected differently within those. Just wanting to thank those who are adding to the discussion here by adding information about their traditions. Thank you all! @oohaylestalesoo  you would probably find this thread interesting|💞💞|@louisedloureiro ainda bem que agora temos você.|Junia, a female apostle, was changed. Check out Juniaproject.com|Honest question: if the people wanted to use the Bible to minimize women roles then why is the Book of Tomas not added to scripture as we know it today?  For example: the idea that Mary, would have to become a man to enter the kingdom of God.|@annaveres.av @patrisjodin|@kaitchristine21 😱🙉🙈🙊|Look, either the bible can be trusted or it can't. You can't pick and choose what YOU *feel* like believing. Although they are not talked about as often as men, the women in the bible play irreplaceable roles; Jesus recognized that. But to say that the bible has ""#genderbias"" is utter nonsense.

143,"But there are a lot more things, while reading articles and a bit of research type things, I came across a lot of points, so here are those which I found, well I tried to express them in an effective way, so lets get to the main points.
So there are few stages or so called careers which are set by the fake society,
This careers are considered as 'manly' professions like IT/technical, fireman/police etc, and it's tough for a guy, who wants to pursue his hobbies like dancing, sketching, etc.
And if a man quits his job for looking after his child, then the society behaves and treats him like a coward, most appropriately ""a guy who eats his wife's earnings"".
And you all might think that only girls are raped then my friend it's absolutely wrong, while reading an article I came to know that in 2007, about 52% boys and 47% girls were raped. Suprising isn't it?

Here is an incident, when I was at a age of around 11 or 12 but I still remember it, everyone had seen transgender on trains, in general compartments or sleeper compartments, and I have seen everyone gives them money, but while traveling with my parents, I heard a man around 45-50 next to my compartment saying one of them (the transgender), SHOW YOUR PARTS AND TAKE THE MONEY, well at that time being a kid I didn't knew what he was talking about. Well now, while reading the articles, that incident clicked.

So guys, here's my thoughts on 
BIAS SOCIETY FOR BOYS
Hope you liked it,

I choose this topic first because everyone is busy with the girls inequality, and it seems to me as if boys don't face any problems.

There are alot more points,
But I may exceed words limit.
So will upload that partwise around 1 or 2 or even more.

Follow me if you don't 
And yes next one will be on
BIAS SOCIETY FOR GIRLS.

158,"Whenever people talk about the injustices against dads in family court, there's always someone asking, ""What if my dad actually was a deadbeat?"" ""What if my baby daddy actually is this, this, and that?"" ""Yeah, but my dad did this, that, and the third."" ""What if family court goes after certain fathers for a reason?

The answer is simple: shut up.

The conversation isn't about you. Fathers deal with enough disrespect without you using their stories as a platform to get attention. Either help them find solutions, or shut up, listen, and learn so you don't end up in their situation.

And the same goes for those of you who interrupt someone's positive talk about fathers to whine about yours. Have the decency to wait until someone asks you for your story.

Thanks @rachel_sex_therapy for sharing! “I’ve said this before and I’ll point it out again… Menstruation is caused by a change in hormonal levels to stop the creation of the uterine lining and encourage the body to flush the lining out. The body does this by lowering estrogen levels and raising testosterone. Or, to put it more plainly ‘that time of the month’ is when female hormones most closely resemble male hormones. So if (cis) women aren’t suited to office at ‘that time of the month’ then (cis) men are never suited to office.

More importantly, if the review committee uses a narrow definition of leadership, they may unfairly exclude a lot of people, like this woman. ⁠
⁠
What can YOU do? 1️⃣. Point out that the woman’s team delivers superb results, and suggest that their performance speaks to her leadership. 2️⃣. You can also ask them to explain the attributes she lacks. When people are asked to justify their thinking, it can help reduce bias in decision-making. 3️⃣. As a longer-term solution, suggest creating detailed metrics for performance reviews, including clear expectations for leaders. This way, all employees will be evaluated based on a more complete definition of good leadership and using the same standards, which reduces bias in the review process.⁠

182,"Is your handbag weighing you down? A symbol of the patriachy?
.
.
This great article by Lisa Miller (link in comments) which I first heard discussed on the Bang On podcast starts with a story of a lady who dropped a full coffee on the subway and every man stepped back, all empty handed and every woman stepped forward after digging in their handbag for an assortment of wipes and tissues to mop up the spill. This is continuing to reinforce the stereotype that women clean up spills.
.
.
I know that when I get a chance to go out without my handbag, I feel so free and light. With two small people, I am so often carrying half the house between nappies, snacks, hats and sunscreen.
.
.
The article by Miller details the handbag throughout history right through to present times where women are loaded up like pack horses. A man without a briefcase or suitcase gives the appearance of ""being so important he has people to carry for him... golf caddies, bell hops, assistants, women."" .
.
What about you? Have you ever tried to go bag-less? .

186,"Microaggressions 😳⁣
⁣
I debated as to whether to share this 🥺⁣
⁣
Swipe (1) to see a  text communication between me and a male physician who had consulted me on his patient ⁣
⁣
As you can see - he told me to take a tranquilizer.  I was shocked and as you can see my response was a total wimp out . ⁣
⁣
Then I read this article in JAMA surgery (swipe 3)
⁣
There are 4 types of Microaggression (swipe 4):
-micro insult ⁣
-micro assault⁣
-micro invalidation ⁣
-environmental Microaggression⁣
⁣
What occurred to me was a Microassault : an intentional verbal attack meant to offend me .⁣
In this case, my attempt to request a Dr to Dr  convo was met with an insult - I am a hysterical woman and need to take a tranquilizer ⁣
⁣
The Authors of the article suggest my  response should have been :⁣
ACTION (swipe 5)
⁣
-Can you tell me why you think I need a tranquilizer?⁣
-ask with curiosity ⁣
-Tell him that I was surprised and confused by his  response ⁣
-Tell him I was offended ⁣
-admit to myself how this made me feel rather than hide the fact that I was humiliated ⁣
⁣
Have any of you been on the receiving end of a work place micro aggression and if so which type ?⁣
⁣",genderbias,"|Omg, yes, very interesting post. Definitely the types of things we need to be talking about! Thanks for bringing awareness 🙏|Unbelievable. You give such great examples of how to deal with this. Thank you for being a guiding light to so many of us.|Wowza! That is mean!|Holu moly! That's crazy! I believe I would have set things straight but I can totally understand where you're coming from. We do tend to wimp out at times for many reasons.|Wow! That’s awful! These are helpful tips! I’ve experienced microinsults and microaggressions, mostly male colleagues not wanting to consult or accept transfers of my patients. I’ll try these tips next time this happens to me 👍🏽|A tranquilizer, really? Because you care about patient care? Would he have said that to a male colleague (I doubt it). Thanks for sharing this.|Omg what?? Sorry- and you rock btw. No tranquilizer needed.|Next time he wants to consult you, tell him to take a tranquilizer you’ll get there when you get there. So mad for you!! How is that considered the slightest bit professional? 🤬|I wonder if this happens in every workplace or just in the “professional” setting.  I was asked via email, “did your law school not teach you how to read?” No they didn’t actually. My kindergarten teacher did.|It's absolutely awful that you had to experience something like that! Thank you for sharing this post and providing a way to deal with these situations|I’m so sorry you went through this Hafiza. So wrong.|That’s so terrible! Thanks for sharing the tips on how to handle situations like this, I hope I will never need to use them 💕|Sorry . This happens a lore more often than it should . I often shoot back with a “right back at ya” and try to pretend that I’m joking - and that it didn’t  touch me . But who am I kidding ?|🙋‍♀️ I’ve been in the receiving in all of this many times. 
That tranquilizer comment was totally inappropriate, that shit makes me so mad, excuse my language.

It’s a little different for my position as nurses are below docs in the hierarchy of medicine, but still, inappropriate is inappropriate, and I have learned to stand up for myself and my clarifying questions. It’s always for the benefit of the patient which should be the bottom line.

I love this post so much. ❤️|I don’t even know what to say because this infuriates me to no end! No one should be talked to this way! It’s demeaning. I would have had the same response you did but then would have regretted it!|My initial response now (nitnwhen i was a new attending) woukd have been. ""Be professional."" sorry this happened to you and continues to happen to many of us in this field|Was that a typo?? Tranquilizer ?? I’m utterly disappointed|That makes me sick. Disgusting|What an ass. I’m sorry if that’s blunt. But that is a jerk move and the kind of behavior in medicine that  I’m just SO DONE with. I know how you feel Hafiza - I probably would have responded like you. But I’m working on finding my voice in the moment and pushing back. We all have to. Thanks for the reminder 👊🏻|I’ve received microaggressions from male colleagues in the past and have let them go, even though I regretted it later.  I try to make an effort to respond calmly and express my confusion, similar to what the article suggests.  Like, “tranquilizer? For what - I’m not following.” Usually causes the person to feel uncomfortable and realize what they said was offensive.|I’m so glad you posted. I’m in internal Med, and have not received direct microaggressions but have behind my back- from both male and female colleagues.|Thank you so much for posting this. Starting the conversation and being honest about how difficult it can be is so important. Seriously appreciated this today.|Thank you so much for posting this.

I’m sorry you had to face that, but thank you for sharing. As a sociology minor, I am well aware of micro aggressions. I think it’s so important for us to acknowledge them and fight back, and I’m glad I know early on so I can hopefully do that once I get into medicine|What!!!?|Sorry you went through this.  microagression is a sad reality|Wow I’m so sorry that happened to you!|Wow....|Anger does begin to express my feelings at how you were treated. If he treats a peer this way, imagine his response to a female patient. And, he put it in writing - brazen.|Alright... so I am the silly clinical psychologist who took this literal.

Thank you for sharing this Hafiza. I probably would have reacted like you did just to respect the other person. Should not really be putting up with this 😡|Thank you Ayrin ❤️|This was such a valuable post to share, so as to help empower others when in such a position. I have reacted similarly to microaggression in the past (even though I knew I should have reacted differently, by standing up for myself).|That is appalling!! I'm sorry that you have had to endure such microaggressions. I really appreciate all your recent posts, please do keep sharing! We desperately need the mentorship and guidance from women like you|I think that when we shut up, we give others the assumption that they are right ... just like Dra Casillas, I think the best way to respond is to show them how resolutive and powerful a ""hysterical"" woman can be ... I have personally decided to stop basing my own opinion on what others think of me and I have decided that my actions will speak louder :) thanks for sharing your article ..! ❤️❤️|Sorry this happened to you. It’s hard to think of a response in the moment. Thank you for these resources so we can handle these encounters better!|@heart.beat.doctor you are a strong person and so lovely women💓🤘🏻 and thanks for sharing this but i think I cannot be calm like you 🙅🏻‍♀️|“Micro”-aggression? No, there was nothing micro about it. It wasn’t hidden or indirect- he simply offended you. And that’s what he wanted. Why is it called “micro”? We shouldn’t continue to make the problem smaller than it is. Because this way we continue reacting softer than we should & keep tolerating people who feel they can behave like this! You shouldn’t have to deal with this stupidity & stupid being!|Wow.  That's my reaction and my recommendation. I've used just that one word to respond to similar comments. I've also found that the only way to deal with a bully is to push back. Wow!|Holy crap - that’s not cool. Thank you for sharing what happens all the time to so many of us 🙏🏻|This is terrible — nothing micro about it. He completely invalidated you.|This was horrible! Thank you for sharing an empowering post.|Ugh! Firstly - sorry you have to deal w this crap. But I’ve been there too. This is such a tough situation bc even if u try to “calmly” call him out & ask “why do I need a tranquilizer” it could actually further his notion that you’re hysterical. Like now you’re getting worked up about a “silly comment” he made in jest. It’s a catch 22 and I think instinctively you knew that and tried to avoid the trap by ignoring it. I can only hope that you’ll find another way to put him in his place. 
But yes - microaggressions are REAL!  We are not imagining this stuff or making it up.|Oh WOW that is not ok.|Omg 😲 Please keep sharing these. It’ll surely help others 😶|First, thank you so much for sharing something so personal but that many of us have faced. We need to shine a light on these awful situations. 2nd, thank you for showing us how we can deal with this in the future! And good for JAMA for publishing. It’s important. 3rd, I just adore you and I think you are bad ass.|Of course he would have never said that to another male physician! I once had a male pulmonologist text me and demand to know why I didn’t want to treat his patient for a positive TB. Oh and he ordered the test not me. 😠|Wow, thank you so much sharing. We have ALL faced this, myself personally from senior residents and attendings, too. I never knew how to respond either. However, I am offended this is still occurring, particularly doctor to doctor, and via text! He was in a meeting but took the time to write something rude instead of helpful? 😕|Innumerable times! From my senior residents, and consults both male and female! It took me years to get the guts to even take ACTION. It saddens me that physicians treat each other like this! Thank you for sharing this post and raising awareness about this.|Woah. Good for you for sharing this but wow tbh I don’t even understand the level of his response.|Completely inappropriate!!!!!! I think it's really challenging to respond in the moment because you are so taken aback. I would still tell to him about it now and tell him you thought it was rude and unnecessary you were simply discussing patient care and didn't warrant that type of response. It's uncomfortable to do it but you deserve to be treated respectfully. 🤗|Hafiza, I am so glad you are using this opportunity to discuss a very important topic.|Seriously? He’s in a meeting and could just say ok. What a jerk. Wish you had a stronger response. Hard in the moment. Thanks for sharing strategies.|What the?!|fantastic topic! thank you for sharing Hafiza. Micro aggression is very common and I usually deal with wimping out to avoid conflict at the time but I talk directly with the person later once I can think more clearly. no one shoud get away with it 🤨 these seemingly small insults can turn work places into hell. I think this one you experienced is a macro aggression though 😲|My blood is boiling-who does he think he is?|💖 thank you for sharing ! Didn't know this notion of microaggression... I had a obgyn in coaching dealing with older  male colleagues treating her like a little girl... ""you come I have to talk to you !!!!""... she just started not coming.. telling she had no time... they learned that it doesn't work like that with her... I encouraged her to affirm her personality and  not go when they called her that way and finally they learned to respect her and tall differently ... in these situations you feel like you no longer know what is normal and  not normal ... and without support it's difficult to respond in a constructive way... particularly when you are the newest one and the youngest... it is indeed weird that doctors have that kind of behavior but not rate at all... our training lacks the part work on yourself... though it is so so important!!! 💓its great that you have the courage to share and it's great that you're receiving so much comfort 🌹|Wow this is RIDICULOUS|Wow Hafiza. So disrespectful! I am so sorry this happened to you!|Woof we are so sorry you had to experience that. Completely uncalled for. We appreciate you sharing that though. We fear female health providers are on the receiving end of workplace agression more times that we think.|Oh yes Hafiza. I had been. So glad you are talking about this.

I’ve only had to do it twice. The first time, my coworker was soooo confused as if he had no idea that what he said was wildly inappropriate, especially in a professional setting. The second time it was actually a former boss and he took a beat and apologized. We have to speak up for ourselves. The worst is when something happens and no one else is willing to stand up for you. But that said, microagressions can just as easily come from women, which I’ve found are more difficult to deal with.|I have absolutely been subject to this over the years. The one that sticks out in mind was when I was reconsulted by an ED Attending to see a patient who was discharged over 2 weeks prior and returns with CHF exacerbation. We both were in the patient’s room. The patient was told she needed readmission. Patient was upset and ED MD said It likely would not have happened if she weren’t discharged home to soon by me. I stood in shock and carried on with the admission after he walked out. Afterwards, I confronted him professionally and told him I was shocked and appalled that he threw me under the bus in front of the patient. I asked why he said that. I told him I was disappointed in him and lost my respect for him. He then apologized and said what he said since he was not feeling well. Wow!|Hopefully there’s no next time, but if there is - you should say something.

I take the high road, and keep my professionalism, but would not let something like that slide without addressing it! Thank you for sharing this crazy situation with us!|Wow. That is ridiculous.

However, he was incredibly  respectful of male nurses. I competed the shadowing out of respect to my school and to represent it well. He offered me a letter of rec and I declined.

Can you let that one land for a moment? I wanted to leave adequate time for the initial flurry of posts to subside following Wanderlust before sharing these clips so they had the space deserving.
🐺
When I originally signed up as a @wanderlustgb ‘ambassador’ i knew that if I was to accept that joyful honour it would be on the premise that I use my privilege as an opening for others, to start conversations demanding a much bigger platform. I loved the entire day, it was truly a magical gathering but hosting this panel in the afternoon felt more than potent.
🐺
These clips are a few random captures (🙏 @jonelleyoga ) of a 40 minute conversation with @mollieyoga , @yogawithnikita , @leilasadeghee - on ‘Women in Yoga’. You can imagine what the entire 40 minutes was like.
🐺
Unfortunately we were derailed (for want of a better word) and didn’t quite get where we needed to. I won’t say too much about that here, yet we all felt the charge of complex trauma arising in that space and the conflict of what it is to hold space collectively for triggering yet necessary conversations, not to mention the proximate fall out.
🐺
There is so much more to say I am barely scratching the surface now and likewise on the day. This conversation was a tiny drop in an ocean impossible to traverse fully. But one thing that will stay with me is how much truth, integrity and power was present in these moments. I have huge respect and love for all of these women and their courage in speaking up with exquisite elegance and presence. I hope next year this conversation will be longer and there will be many more listening.
🐺

Crown is tingling. The charge is still in my cells from bearing witness to that day. The things that it stirred that refused to be contained at the end. Afterwards the debrief was so helpful to let it land a bit. I'll never forget @leilasadeghee saying to me ""perhaps go hug a tree"" 
It was a big day x|Sadly this is any industry or pretty much anyTHING in a patriarchal society. Yoga seems to ‘position itself’ to be counter that, so the system actually becomes more covert and potentially harder to break. I’m starting to try and spread the awareness of this to men as I think we equally have a role in unpacking this. I believe it all starts with awareness and conversations like this, changes to ourselves and then we can start to tackle bigger picture|I would love the conversation to continue at Exhale...?|Thank god you’ve started this conversation, would’ve loved to have seen the whole thing. It absolutely cannot wait. Think we need an intersectional feminist yoga conference, not just a single panel 💪🏼|I’ve been thinking this for a while so pleased to hear it voiced.|This is so refreshing and we are so proud to have you guys on our platform.

Is the whole conversation available anywhere?|Bloody brilliant lady. I’m all ears and support this conversation fully x|🙏|Lovely to be there and witness 🙏🏻|How did I miss this one?! Wow. Go @yogawithnikita|I would have loved to hear the musings from those present on 'what we can do about' some of the issues you raise.... I think what you've quoted here from @yogawithnikita is sadly often very true, obviously in the sense of 'shoppables'! But I also wonder, again uncomfortably, how we're ALL often unwittingly colluding with it in OUR teaching.... The 'selling' or marketing of classes, retreats etc.... It's all very cringe - but is that my patriarchal conditioning keeping me down in my place, always wanting to hide? As you alluded @naomiabsalom it is a complex Web... I think its shifting,  I feel hopeful, and conversations like these will encourage I hope 🙏|Thanks @yogawithnikita for the tag. I’m amending my comment since she explained to me what that event was about (and adding apologies for posting- when I get tagged I often make the assumption that people want me to comment). But I'll say: I'm glad these conversations are happening. At the same time I caution us about White exceptionalism and performative allyship, which it feels like we white women yogis are so drawn to. I wish there were more BIPOC on this panel (like I do in the U.S. too). Without that, it's so easy to inadvertently center white voices which has been happening in the yoga world too much. , however knowledgeable, don’t have the depth of experience and perspective on social justice that BIPOC do. One consequence is that we can get all up into optics and not realize what we’re doing or what we’re not seeing. I understand how difficult it is to cope with our own complicity, our contribution, to social inequity and injustice. What else is yoga for, than to help us do that? We can't say that ""We are all one"" and not do that work to make it so. White women make up a large % of the yoga, spiritual, and wellness worlds and yet really avoid our own inability to look at how we ARE complicit by our lack of study, inner work, awareness of intersectionality, and shadow. And I don’t think most white yoga practitioners are ready to look. We want to keep the political out. Or we want to address the political when it suits us and not when we are the subject in the problem. And that’s white privilege. Again, happy the conversation is happening. Would love to see more inclusivity and equity in how it’s happening. White people don’t need to be the primary driver or voice of this perhaps, but to take a back seat to those who already are. 🙏🏼|@lizjoyoakley @welfordwellbeing @boochikombucha|@drmilneryoga some snippets of a powerful panel discussion x|@naomiabsalom is there a recording of the full panel discussion available anywhere ?

201,"Myra Strober became a feminist on the Bay Bridge, heading toward San Francisco. It is 1970. She has just been told by the chairman of Berkeley’s economics department that she can never get tenure. Driving home afterward, wondering if she got something out of the freezer for her family’s dinner, she realizes the truth: She is being denied a regular faculty position because she is a mother. Flooded with anger, she also finds her life’s work: to study and fight sexism, in the workplace, in academia, and at home. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In a 2016 episode of the MIT Press podcast, following the publication of her memoir ""Sharing the Work,"" Myra opened up about that life-changing meeting at Berkeley, how her childhood affected her views on women in the workplace, and the stubborn challenges — and industries — that continue to hold women back. The entire episode is now up with a transcription at THEREADER.MITPRESS.MIT.EDU (article: ""An Economist's Fight for Equity in the Workplace""). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

One of the questions was, ""have you ever played with dolls?"" like owning a baby doll in your lifetime means you'll obviously want kids. Then he kept prying about irrelevant info about my trans girlfriend at the time. Was super creepy, and to top it all off he asked my mom if she was ok with her adult kid tying their tubes, as if he could convince her to guilt me. Fuck that guy, I'm sad I forgot his name!",25

205,"I’m getting lots of messages from men. 
That have suffered abuse.

And they are doing a lot of their healing in silence, and confusion. 
The cognitive dissonance, or confusion I had trying to process what I had conceived of as normal behavior, as actually being abusive behavior, as a female I am realizing must be extremely crippling for men. 
Men don’t get abused. 
Men are too strong to be abused. 
Men can’t be weak. 
Men have to be strong. 
This is cultural conditioning, and it needs to stop. 
Men, all men, even abusive men are sentient beings. They have feelings, a soul, desires and they also have the right to those- any of them. If you really take a deep dive into it, most abusive men were victims of abuse themselves and their healing was probably cut off because our culture denies them the right to access and express their feelings.

This anger turned inward is why we see a rise in addictions, narcissism and other abusive behaviors- we tell them first, you’re not a victim and if you are, you’d better shut that down- men don’t cry. 
We literally expect them to live in delusion. To shut themselves off from their feelings. 
Let’s change the conditioning: 
Men can be victims. 
Men are victims. 
Men can cry. 
Men can be weak. 
Men can break down. 
Men can do yoga. 
Men can meditate. 
And men can heal. 
But you cannot heal until your pain gets validated. You cannot heal until you are able to go there with those feelings, to take the dive to access, explore and reconstruct these traumas, these violations. You cannot heal until you’re validated that it’s ok to have been abused, to have been weak. 
Just because a man has a penis doesn’t mean he should be denied any of the real avenues to owning his abuse and owning his healing. 
This is where generational trauma stops- when we give women and men each the right to own their ability to heal themselves.",genderbias,|You have a way of cutting through the fluff and pulling out the truth.

208,"From the archives (part 1 of 2): this is a story I created back in 2013 for an app called Tapestry that no longer exists. Thankfully, parenting is a timeless art. What struck me with this project was how unpredictable the advice that stayed with my friends and siblings were.

209,"Can women do specific exercise to lose weight on their thighs? Or belly or hips or whatever body part.
.
.
We still get this question from so many people, and all the videos and ""tutorials"" on this topic by popular health and beauty social media channels only make it worse by perpetuating this myth. But wait, is it a myth?
.
.
Can women actually do specific exercises to lose fat in specific body parts? Let's break it down.
.
.
Yes, you can do specific exercises to lose fat. But not just at that body part. Fat loss happens throughout the body and we don't have a natural way of controlling where we lose how much fat.
.
.
Based on our genetics 🧬, activity 🏋️‍♀️, nutrition 🥙, sleep 😴 and stress 😫 we all store fat in different parts of the body and in different proportions. While it would be great to control where to gain and lose fat, the body doesn't work that way and anyone telling you otherwise or selling pills, potions or a workout programme to spot-reduce fat is simply scamming you.
.
.
If you want to lose fat, irrespective of where in your body that is, start by working out, sleeping more and eating better. Do this consistently for a few months and you'll see that the fat disappears while so many other good things in your life start to appear.
.
.
And in case you're wondering, the above is true no matter what your gender is! The biased lens of gender makes it harder for women to pursue health and fitness goals in peace. So please do your part by not spreading unverified information about gender based differences in training and nutrition. And of course, by sharing sensible, verified information like this post. .

Have a great start to the week! #mythbustingmonday

A friend of mine, a gentleman, remarked that a certain lady was 'manly' because she dominated her team and lacked any 'nazakat' 🙄🤔🤔

To which I replied that it's not only nazakat or physical sophistication that defines women. After all look at athletes like Hima Das and Serena Williams.
.
The answer I got was shocking. 'yes they too are not at all like women ' .
.
That makes me wonder, dude which century do you live in? .
A woman is labelled manly or unladylike because she isn't demure ,shy, hesitant and lacking voice. .
The disparity between genders doesn't stop there. Any man who likes cooking or enjoys using make-up is called 'girly'.
.
So apparently being a girl is an insult for the macho. .
I wonder if a gender neutral world would be better after all. Where we wouldn't judge or look down upon others who don't live by gender norms.

Our information suggests she has enough brand influence in terms of value. Less than 90 percentile of recognized Countries. Much less. Much less. That's before she starts working. Before she leaves her house. If Sheryl wants to be happy joyful and in love that's up to her. Never the less, women nor men haven't even fully unpacked what a force like planetary gravidity can do and effect. ""The ultimate luxury is to combine passion with contribution. Also a clear path to happiness"" Sheryl's words. Huemantechnologies thinks that is an adequate explanation for talent acquisition as well. We established the traditional and professional and means; and in response to your Maire Claire article. Unfortunately no explanation for the most efficient and fastest is available. Such information is restricted. Fortunately we can say Why?  Speaking from a Huemantechnologies platform, it ran her through our metrics. Energy, acquisitions, passions. Hmmmm… #internp1|…#.internp3 #textile #Love #pointedbodylanguage #2018 #election #cycle #splcenter #Huemantechnologies #product #service #simulation Equals why. Plus, pretty interesting cross multi-displines cross hatching occurring throughout. Given, for example in metrices her orthographic output and a comparison inquiry of the same labeled output. We determined that she was the one. A broad scope composite was used. Unfortunately the metric itself is restricted. I will indicate, material reference nomenclature such Gates, Bezos, coaches, mentors, leaders cognitive-behavioral stuff used. Plus some of my personal idiosyncratic criteria building stuff. Huemantechnologies needs her ambition, qualifications, performance, heart, and some of her idiosyncratic stuff. Huemantechnologies is very, or can be very persuasive.  Hmm.. ambition, qualifications, performance, and....heart. If my life existed exactly as I commanded, this comment doesn't exist. Trust me. Fortunately in a reverse and predictable curser to myself and Huemantechnologies and our kentics in talent acquisitions, some will have to wait there turn. Like me and some 20 other humans.

Your correct about when ensuring the survivability of female and women initiatives. One is the least in strength. And certainly a ill conceived goal if successful return of female lead roles within female codified and women initiatives. You guys pooled six this round. Where do you think the flatting occurred with the DNC now? if debates was charged by humans, and you guys pooled 6 humans to start with. If the primary goal is to have a presidential candidate and succession of proportional return year after year, How do you now keep the fire burning to ensure the torch continually burns for future event-related, time-related and topic&category related occurances? Perhaps the reason that the pop-for-shizzle dizzle ambience decreased because in a sensational and identity socioecon-poltical landscape a lack of single identity and sensational direction didn't occur from the DNC side. That's okay because at the end of the day a mimium number of senate and rep seats are needed for a complete sweep. you guys have the resources, fiances and wherewithal to accomplish a clean swept election. Prsident Trump will go out and meet the DNC candidates Cally he started just recently as with NY.

238,"Remember where we came from, and where we are headed. This might be the most valuable thing I’ve learned since finishing training:  women in medicine need to lift each other up. We need to raise our voices in support of each other, in support of our lgbtq2sia kin, and of our culturally diverse kin. 
Patriarchal values are very much alive and well in surgery, and lack of mentorship and, even more so, sponsorship for women and minorities persists.  Here are some suggestions for ways to incorporate a little bit of feminism into your practice during training and early career: 
1. Join a society repping women and minorities. In Orthopaedics we have the RJOS (Ruth Jackson Orthopaedic Society) but there are countless others. 
2. Search and follow women and minorities in medicine and science on social media platforms. This gives us a voice. 
3. Read up on recent publications about gender bias in surgery and medicine. There have been a fair few recently. 
4. When discussing barriers to women in medicine, please consider things other than pregnancy, children, and family life.  Assuming these are the only issues reinforces bias. 
6. Call out bias when you see it but educate, don’t berate. 
5. Be unapologetically feminine, masculine or undecided if that’s who you are, because somebody out there needs a mentor who is unapologetically like them. 
6. People who identify as genders other than men are experience imposter syndrome more frequently. Let me be one to tell you that you absolutely deserve to be where you are, and you do know what you are doing. Do the world a favour and apply for positions, grants, scholarships, and opportunities in abundance.  We need more than just seats at the table, but it’s a start. #genderbias #lgbtq #diversity

242,"The jewelry maker Alex and Ani, founded by Carolyn Rafaelian, is suing Bank of America  for $1.2 billion, arguing that gender bias and greed have led it into a financial ""death spiral.""
.
Bank of America wrongly placed the company in default on a $170 million loan and froze a $50 million revolving line of credit because of age and gender discrimination, according to the lawsuit.
.
""The endgame is clear: Bank of America wants the women out of power at Alex and Ani,"" the company says in the lawsuit.
.
Alex and Ani alleges in the lawsuit that Bank of America has a ""checkered past"" with respect to gender bias in lending and that ""it is perhaps unsurprising what happened after a triumvirate of strong women"" took control at the company.
.
Alex and Ani, founded in 2004, has 104 store locations, most of them in the United States, and also sells it jewelry at hundreds of other authorized retailers including Nordstrom and The Paper Store.
.
Rafaelian was listed 22nd in Forbes America’s Richest Self-Made Women in 2016, with net worth estimated at $700 million in June 2016. As of June 2018, Rafaelian is estimated to be worth $1 billion, and 18th on the Forbes list of America's richest self-made women, owning 80% of Alex and Ani.",genderbias,|#alexandani #jewelery #lawsuit #carolynrafaelian #genderbias #bankofamerica #genderdiscrimination #discrimination #powerfulwomen|Wow|Go for it|What a disgrace,93

Howley's picture book is a strong provocation towards conversations on the topic of #manhood #manliness and #whatmakesaman, while challenging #genderbias and #stigmas.

⁠⠀
It is widely known that female patients have been under-represented in scientific research studies. Often gender bias has been the result of efforts to exclude and protect women of childbearing age. It has also resulted from the antiquated thought that disease processes affect men and women similarly, and from the fact that women have been considered more expensive subjects due to the impact of fluctuating hormone levels (Wizemann T., et al; Washington DC: National Academies Press, 2001).⁠⠀
⁠⠀
In the early 1990s, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandated that women be included in all NIH funded research studies. And while things have certainly improved since then, there is still much progress to be made. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
So why does this matter? It matters because there is increasing evidence that various disease processes and medications impact women differently than men. If we only study men and extrapolate the data to women, we aren't necessarily applying good science in women. In fact, the findings in men may be completely irrelevant in women. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
The classic example is coronary artery disease (CAD), which has been studied in far greater depth in men than in women. As a result, much of what we understand about CAD pertains to men with CAD. Yet, we now understand that women often present with different symptoms of CAD than men and respond differently to treatments that have been predominantly studied in men (Pinn VW; JAMA 2003). We cannot simply extrapolate data from men and apply it to women if we want to improve CAD outcomes in women.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
There is a critical need to include women in scientific studies and for gender specific research and data analysis if we truly want to positively impact health outcomes in women.⁠🌸⁠⠀

259,"“I raise up my voice, not so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard.” - Malala

I want to address a sensitive subject that may hit home to many - gender bias in medical care. I’ve seen it and have been a victim of it.

Did you know that women are more likely to be misdiagnosed or written off simply because practitioners didn’t believe the extent of their symptoms or conditions?

Researchers examined the differences in care between male and female patients and found:
✖️In heart attack patients who sought medical attention prior to the event, 53% of women said their doctor did not believe their symptoms were cardiovascular related, compared to 37% of men.
✖️Women’s reproductive health concerns are more likely to be dismissed compared to men and therefore prolongs proper diagnosis and treatment. ✖️Women experience higher in-hospital death rates than men.
✖️Women of color, especially mothers, are subject to even higher mortality rates, many of which are due to their practitioners not listening to or underestimating their concerns.

This is not okay🚫

If you are a practitioner, take an extra moment to stop and think about what else you could be missing. We all have biases, but we need to leave them at the door to provide the best care for our patients.

If you are a patient, I encourage you to speak up and ask questions. A doctor is of service to you and if they are not serving you in the way you need them to, then you need to find someone who aligns with your health goals.

I joined the medical field so I could be an advocate for the women, who like me, were continually dismissed. I want to give you a voice in your health🗣

268,"Indiscreet is another film hindered by it’s attitude towards women and, in this case, relationships in general among consenting adults. It would benefit greatly from an update, but that’s not to say that it isn’t groundbreaking in some regards. In fact, the majority is filled with great moments and it’s disappointing that the ending reverts so much. #carygrant and #ingredbergman got to break cinematic conventions of romance on the screen through clever camera work by director #stanleydonen. Couples, even those that were married, were not shown in the same bed. Donen has the two in completely different buildings, but it’s a split shot that gives the effect of laying right next to each other. It’s genius and neat that the same pairing broke the rules in Notorious with the “longest kiss” on film 12 years before. Bergman plays Anna, an actress that falls for Grant’s business man Philip. The problem is that he’s married... or is he? When Anna finds out that he’s lied to her, the movie cranks it up a gear and I loved Bergman’s performance. Her line delivery and facial expressions ooze a sly disgust. Her grand plan for revenge is brilliant and I was eagerly awaiting its payoff. That’s when the movie failed to deliver and redeems the shitty actions of Philip. He has the gall to judge her when he was the deceitful one. Boy, I wish that ending had been different. I want a new take where Anna gets a little payback. ⭐️⭐️⭐️",genderbias,|#indiscreet #indiscreetmovie #1958 #1950s #shareabed #cameratricks #needsupdating #genderbias,13
269,"#CareerAdvice for #WorkingWomen ✅  Delivering a presentation in a professional setting can be a daunting task for anyone, but especially so if you’re an ambitious #careerwoman struggling to ascend the corporate ladder in the face of unconscious gender bias!  That being said, key to executing a presentation in a way that most effectively communicates your point is to “know your audience”, which if you’re an American career woman, is more than likely to largely be made up of men who avoid the phrase “unconscious gender bias” like the plague.  If this situation sounds familiar, (worry not!) I encourage you to just relax and continue being yourself but learn to speak in an artificially low voice and to change your name to Jeff.  This strategy is effective because it unconsciously creates a more trusting response from this particular audience as it will be more natural for them to trust a deeper voice from a person named Jeff to actually know what they’re talking about than a woman acting normal – even if Jeff has breasts and delivers the presentation in a noticeably unnatural tone of voice. 🧑🏻👠💼📈👏🏻👨🏼‍🦳

“LADIES’ HORSE.” “PREFERS MALE RIDERS.”“HATES MEN WITH A PASSION!” These descriptions, all taken from real Internet ads or Web sites, are but a handful of the ways we humans describe a phenomenon that might be called gender bias in horses. ⁣
-⁣
The notion that some horses prefer to be handled by men (or by women) is widespread among horse owners. ⁣

271,"There’s no denying the inherent gender bias in modern healthcare. Study after study show that women are given less pain medication and more sedatives than men, suggesting our pain stems from anxiety and less a physical cause. Women are still often seen as the “hysterical” sex😒, and therefore pain and other symptoms are typically taken less seriously. 
In a study comparing gender and treatment of acute abdominal pain, men waited an average of ✨49 minutes before receiving an analgesic while women waited an average of ✨65 minutes for the same exact thing. Young women are 🔥seven🔥 times more likely to be sent home from the hospital in the middle of having a heart attack and experience longer diagnostic delays in comparison to men for nearly everything. Could this bias be the reason why more women are seeking alternative healthcare than their male counterpart?

A 2014 study confirmed that female heart❤️ attack patients weren’t being tested and treated as efficiently as their male counterparts in the emergency room🏥. The researches then gave the patients a personality test gauging how much they conformed to typically gender stereotypes👫. They found that both genders were treated with more delay when they identified as more traditionally “feminine.” In the essay, ✨The Girl Who Cried Pain✨, which analyzed gender bias in the medical industry through dozens of scientific studies states, “Although the growth of holistic medicine may be one silver lining of conventional medicine's gender-biased approach to pain treatment, this does not change the ethical imperative to rectify our mainstream health-care system's unjust treatment of women with pain. It is necessary to begin educating health-care providers and those who train them to expose biases that lead to the under-treatment of women.” It’s such an important essay - I’ve included the link to it in my bio.

Why cant India let it go as per the will of Kashmiris & UN Resolution! Its their land let them live the way they wish!

""It is time to end the tradition in science of all-male speaking panels, sometimes wryly referred to as 'manels,'"" Collins wrote. ""Too often, women and members of other groups underrepresented in science are conspicuously missing in the marquee speaking slots at scientific meetings and other high-level conferences.""⠀

""When I consider speaking invitations, I will expect a level playing field, where scientists of all backgrounds are evaluated fairly for speaking opportunities,"" he wrote. ""If that attention to inclusiveness is not evident in the agenda, I will decline to take part.""⠀

277,"A brief documentary and a couple of stories can be found at the link below.

Oli Loyne was 18 when he started taking steroids to get bigger.

His mother, Sarah, said his muscle dysmorphia may have been triggered by insecurities over his height. ""It was a lot to do with the fact he was so short,"" she said. ""He was about 5'2"". He didn't have the height and he wanted to make up for that by being as wide as he could.

Oli's excessive training and steroid use led to two heart attacks and a stroke when he was 19.

He died after having a third heart attack when he was 20. ""There was just no getting through to him. No getting through about what he was doing to his body,"" said Sarah. ""He was like 'I need to look like the image in my head. I need to look big.

I was taught to apologize  or ignore these comments but I now speak up even if I’m considered rude .As an older woman, I am untouchable in the face of public opinion now.⁣

So glad to have wonderful role models like you!!|O how many of these comments I have heard (and continue to hear). Absolutely agree that we have to stand up to this toxic behavior.|So beautiful. Definitely hard. Sometimes weeding out toxic people means that you’ll be left with a small circle of friends. Quality over quantity!|This is amazing and we couldn’t agree more! 🙌🏻|Love this and 💯💯|Love this !
You are an Inspiration.|Goodness gracious. Gotta love aunties 😂|Beautiful !!|I agree! 👏🏽|The worse criticism that I’ve ever received has been from other women. It’s disheartening when they tell you not to do something or tell you that you can’t have everything. Just remember that you won’t receive criticism from people that are doing more than you, it’s always someone that is doing less|Completely agree with you. We have to lift each other up❤️🙌🏾|Untouchable in the face of the public opinion 🔥🔥|Yes! Yes! Yes! Love this post! We must support each other, and especially younger generations 🙏💕🙌|Love this. This applies to younger women and women less experienced or who are up and coming as well...even if they are not necessarily younger.|So so true !!!😀💖💖💖|Love this post. I’ve experienced so many of these comments and frankly I’m done with it! 
Let’s be more encouraging, empowering and supporting each other rather than critiquing all the time! 👏🏽👏🏽|I am so glad you’ve decided to speak up. That’s an awesome example for the younger women who are DEFINITELY watching. Nice work Hafiza ❤️❤️|Thank you 🙌🏻. I am watching and it's the reason I follow you, and other Physicians like you. I appreciate you sharing, it let's me know that I can ""have it all"", and that knowledge is truly priceless. It's keeps me going on my path, and others, that will hopefully allow us to change and save lives. It's a domino effect and I thank you!|These 3 simple words are so important, it changes so many things. Thanks for sharing your wisdom, I hope women really embrace your advice|Thanks for this. So true!!|Just love you so much hafiza!! Thank you for standing up for the younger generation.|👌👌👌👌 people must realise what goes around comes around in one way or other. ❤️❤️|If I had a penny for the amount of times I have heard these comments directed at me or someone I know... women especially desi women need a lesson in ‘how to mind your own business’ it’s great to see people finally talking about this on public platforms :)|🙏👍|Yes!! 💕|Omg I lover this post I have come across so many of those. Somewhere along the lines women are meant to compete for being more skinny, being able to cook better than the other person, being judged on her makeup. I call it out now when I see anyone comparing me with someone else I am not here to compete with another woman the future will be better where we empower each other|The woman, wife and mom shaming is so so prevalent and hurtful. I love that you answer back. I generally do with but with fury. Curious, what do you say to these people?|😍|Yes yes yes!!!!|We really are in sync @heart.beat.doctor !! I’ve been reading Violence by women against women - fascinating. We need to write that book!|Such a powerful message 💕|Had to read this post twice and digest it in between. It really hits home.

I’m so surprised.  I always find so many helpful, empowering, encouraging women and try to be that way myself.  Role models are important!|This hits home.  Sadly.  In the desi culture women are controlled by these types of statements... by women to protect the patriarchy system.  The best we can do is to empower others and raise sons who understand this system|I feel this so much, especially in the Pakistani community. But I have so much hope for this new generation 💕|Love your words 💕💕, i can feel these lines 😑😑 you touch my heart , so true .|Haha Chinese culture is somewhat similar! I find myself identifying with these things! You’re a fierce Auntie 🙌 I’m sure people appreciate it!|Not sure you could’ve said this any better!  Thank you so much for this!!

Well written|People tend to forget that a lot of the belittling happens in the family. Love that you’re putting a spotlight on empowering women from within the family. For me, those little sarcastic and belittling comments from my Mother about my life hurts my self-esteem. However comments from people who aren’t in my family don’t affect me at all.|Such a great message! 🙌🙌|👏👏👏👏 very wise.|#sheforshe #empoweringwomen #nobullying #desiauntiescansuckit #dontgossip🚫 #supportoursisters #supportourdaughters #itsnoneofyourbusiness #mindyourownbusiness #nomoremeangirls #somedocs #heforshe #futuredoctor #doctortobe #southasian #desiproblems #doctorlife #genderbias #itsnoneofyourdamnbusiness|So unbelievable and totally believable that you were told all these things!!!

Hafiza, you f$&king rock! ❤️❤️❤️|Love it!🧡 #womenforwomen|Totally agree. I don’t stand by for that stuff anymore either. I have to speak up.|Every career oriented Indian origin girl must have heard all these comments. 
Though you have said nicely in last paragraph about responding to those comments! 👌🏻|Absolutely every time you stand up for yourself you stand up for every generation of young women that will come after you!! I hope more women confronting these comments will mean soon there will be a generation of young women who never have to know what it feels like to hear these things!|Girl power 🙌🏽 love it!! All about supporting one another 💕|Wow Hafiza great post! I can’t count the number of times female (and male) physicians have told me “you’re too nice to to be a cardiologist”, “you won’t be able to handle being a cardiologist once you have kids” etc, from residency forward 🤦🏽‍♀️ I agree it’s so important for older women to support younger women 👏🏽 thank you for posting this|You are just absolutely incredible Hafiza and so right. I’ve seen this happen a lot. Have experienced it myself. Thank you for calling this out.|This. Is. Amazing. It’s basically a 🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽 to all the aunties that told me very similar things.|Yikes! We get enough from outside, we don’t need family piling on.|🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 thank you for this! We have to change the perception of the ""expected goals"" for women, place the power back in our own hands 🙌🏽🙌🏽|These aunties have told me the exact same things! Will the real Auntie please stand up? Thank you for changing and correcting the dialogue|Are you kidding me?! I don’t take 💩 like that either. I figure it’s my body, my uterus, my money, my kids and my life. I do with them as a darn well please. Proud of you for speaking up for yourself! 👊🏼|You are simply incredible Hafiza. This should be blasted across the internet!! ♥️ @scarymommy @workingmomkind @workingmother|I think one would go crazy if they dwelled on those questions 🤨 Great job overcoming it 🙂👏👏|Yes!💯 Ridiculous that women can judge each other this way!|I love this ❤️💯|Ugh women are so scrutinized! Female empowerment is so important and offering help rather than judgement !👌🏻|❤️|Ya why not|This. Is. Amazing. 🙌🙌🙌🙌|Yes 👆👆👆this. Been there heard all that. It’s soul crushing especially as a young woman trying to figure things out. You are a badass and thank you for changing the culture and speaking up!🙌|soo true and ahh those aunties 😏 those were the ladies who embedded the imposter thing in us 😒 Took a while for me to realize that judgment comes from insecurities and empowerment comes from self confidence!|Yes x 100!|This is incredible!!! You are a power house!!!! I love it!!!💞💞💞💞|I can’t wait to be this wiser self.  Honestly, I think I’m close😉|This is perfect! It’s crazy that this happens! So great of you to call this out!|You are an inspiration! I have heard exactly all those exact same lines from the women in my community too! You can have the last laugh as they say or consciously educate the ignorant- i hope you are doing both 😬|Beautiful|I stand with you Hafiza 👏🏻👏🏻 love this so much. 😍😘|Yeasss. Powerful message. Than you so so much. You’re such a powerhouse. Some aunties, and other relatives just don’t make it easier for me, a woman in medicine. That’s why IG communities like this, a tribe of badass doctor moms like you give me courage to keep going. Hugs 🤗 ❤️❤️|Such powerful words, so full of conviction!  May we nurture the next generation such that they don’t hear these things from us!! We can empower with our gestures, with our words, with our offer to mentor.|Nice to see this 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽|It really is your own family sometimes telling you nothing but negatives. Here's to women staying strong anyway #Cheerstoyou|Wow - good for you for shrugging off all the negativity and succeeding in spite of it.|You go girl 👊🏻. Kick those Aunties and all of their shade straight to the curb 😘|When I was a younger desi girl, I always felt the pressure when people asked “what is she studying? Did she get admission into med school? When is she getting married?” As a pediatrician and mother, I hear similar comments about my parenting style....you’re right-the ones within our family sting the most bc we are taught family above all in our culture. 
I think you’re amazing and this message is wonderful 💗|These are the judgmental, hurtful comments that beat all of us down. Women need to stop throwing these around and I applaud you for standing up to it. With you 💯. The older I get, the less of an ability I have to give a polite response.

285,"#TablaTuesdays | There's always been an unspoken gender bias and divide in the world of Indian classical music. But ever so often, a few women musicians emerge that mercifully change the status quo. Just like Sukanya Ramgopal on the Ghatam, the Tabla virtuoso Anuradha Pal is one such amazing woman.
@anuradhapaltabla has been described as the ""first professional female tabla player in the world"" by Encyclopaedia Britannica and the Limca Book of Records. A student of the legendary Alla Rakha and his legendary son Zakir Hussain, Anuradha started performing as a professional artist from the age of 10. By the time she turned 17, newspapers were already calling her ""Lady Zakir Hussain"". In her illustrious career, she has performed at several prestigious venues like Woodstock Festival and Berklee College of Music.

Tapi saya baru sadar bahwa sampai bulan lalu saya ga pernah punya sesuatu yg just plain pink. Mungkin mayoritas kamyu akan bilang ""ya wajarlah kalo cowok sih"". Tapi kalo dipikir2 lagi, ga logis ah kata saya mah. Apa urusannya warna dan jenis kelamin? Selama pink ga punya vagina maka pink bukan perempuan, pink itu...ya warna aja.
.
Menyongsong kelahiran anak lanang yg akan brojol seputaran Q4 nanti, saya ga mau mendiskualifikasi warna pink dari preferensi dia. Harus mulai dr saya dong, maka belilah kaos pink bulan lalu. Hipotesa awal saya at least bakal ada yg ngeliatin ga santai. Saya pake ke kantor, tempat makan pinggir sungai, mal, spbu, jalan kaki di seputaran kantor, dll, ternyata hipotesa saya ga terbukti. Apa krn muke yg terlalu seram jd takut ngeliatin? Ga tau deh. Mungkin harus ke lokasi yg asosiasi dengan laki2nya kuat, semacam bengkel Harley? Tapi ga punya Harley. Atau toko pomade?

293,"Ever experienced gender bias in your industry?  We'd like to share a disturbing incident in the #Mezcal industry. Link in profile 🔝to read our full account. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣Featured image is a great book by @sarahcpr. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
SOME men in the mezcal industry apparently feel very threatened by Erstwhile’s aesthetics, which are tied to one of our social missions: Woman Empowerment in Mezcal. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
It started with a Reddit discussion thread.  Someone posted a link to an Erstwhile blog post about our Henequén mezcal, the first of its kind in the US market⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣. Instead of focusing on the SUBSTANCE of the post or on why Henequén is interesting (or not?) as a mezcal, the discussion went off topic and immediately took a disturbing turn. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
One man who had not read Erstwhile’s published social mission statement questioned whether we had a social mission at all, stating Erstwhile boils down to a “foreigner lady” who lives a “lavish lifestyle” of “look how rich we are and we’re gonna go get mezcal from poor people and bring it back to NYC for the rich people to enjoy.”⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
HIS words, not ours. Made and defended by men in the Mezcal industry no less. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Other men jumped to defend him.  According to them, Erstwhile pays attention to female things like “fashion and aesthetic”, and looks great on Instagram, so we cannot be serious promoters of mezcal or mezcalero families.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣What is the focal point triggering these men’s ""rich"" descriptions? ⁣⁣⁣⁣They would never admit it, but it became clear the focal point triggering their ire is the strong female presence in Erstwhile's images. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Are these men reacting to any lifestyle projected by Erstwhile? ⁣⁣⁣Or are they reacting to base instincts, like unabashed displays of design and aesthetics by a female owner, NOT a “booth babe”, is a threat to their turf? ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

Lol!!|This is Kevin Brown, I am a junior partner in Erstwhile Mezcal.  In the interest of full disclosure, It was I who initially saw the Reddit thread and brought it to Yuan's attention.  It was also I who took the photo that some found so off-putting. 
Nonetheless, I have to say, as someone who witnessed and participated this Reddit thread first hand, it was utterly disgusting. 
It amounted to a bunch of cronies, some associated with major brands, who attacked Ertswhile's branding and Yuan personally, for no other reason than that she was an attractive woman infringing upon their 'turf.' None of them had read about Erstwhile's values or even tried any of Erstwhile's mezcals.  Instead, they focused solely on her, objectifying her as a female and as an object, disregarding any quality she could bring to the trade. 
Now, this is someone who gave up a law career to pursue a dream of connecting her favorite mezcals to a wider audience while at the same time helping out her mezcalero friends in Oaxaca to expand the appreciation for their mezcal.  Not one person in the Reddit mezcal form, other than myself, came to her defense, instead most, some even after admitting to the deplorable nature of the worst comments, defended them.  Moreover, today, a series of troll accounts were created on Instagram to further attack and degrade both Yuan and the brand. 
Absolutely and utterly disgusting.|WOW!!! You're doing such amazing things that it's literally making them freak out and act pitifully! Keep rocking and doing YOU!",68

@varsha_varghes1 and I crunched some data and we've something to tell you. We are united in this discrimination we face. We have the same frustration that a girl as young as 14 faces. This is a sample survey of the girls responses ( 22). 45% said girls need education and they had a variety of reasons - why should boys get everything ? Men can do manual work, women can't, we need education, without education nothing can happen. 
Some of the funny/interesting answers we recieved were - boys lose interest in studying - boys only care about themselves - girls will get married, what is the point? 
Sharing all this information here so that you are aware of the reality of the world around you. Next time you see a school girl, go tell her she can do it. She has it in her. Uplift your sister.

304,"Let's do a little #SheMDJournalClub about PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION. ⁠
⁠
➖⁠
This article discusses the idea of pregnancy discrimination, or pregnancy resulting in women getting ""knocked off the professional ladder."" This article is NOT specific to medicine.  The authors argue that pregnancy discrimination remains widespread in businesses across our country, and can start as soon as a woman is showing and last through her early years as a mother.⁠
⁠
➖⁠
A study done by the NY Times showed: ""Many of the country’s largest and most prestigious companies still systematically sideline pregnant women. They pass them over for promotions and raises. They fire them when they complain.""⁠
⁠
➖⁠
⁠
Pregnant women and mothers are often perceived as less committed, steered away from prestigious assignments, excluded from client meetings and slighted at bonus season.⁠
⁠
➖⁠
⁠
A 2014 analysis of wages showed that each child a woman has chops 4 percent off a woman’s hourly wages.  However mens' income increases by 6 percent when they become fathers, after controlling for experience, education, marital status and hours worked.⁠
⁠ ➖⁠
⁠
Another study by the Census Bureau examined the pay of spouses. The looked at the couples income two years before their first child and when the child turned one.  They found that prior to children, the husbands made only slightly more than their wives. But by the time their child turned 1, the size of that pay gap had doubled to more than $25,000. And I quote, ""Women taking maternity leave, dropping out of the work force or working fewer hours could contribute to that disparity, but it DOES NOT explain all of it."" ⁠
⁠
➖⁠
⁠
It is so important that we are aware of the ⁠
#MaternalWall effect so that we can combat it - whether by vocalizing our goals and career aspirations at our institutions to promote ourselves, encouraging men to take paternity leave, or even reporting it to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in order to create change. ⁠
⁠
➖⁠
⁠
For a link to the article more thoughts, check out our Journal Club section on SheMD.org by clicking the link in our bio.⁠

#MaternalWall #pregnancydiscrimination #genderbias #sheMD",genderbias,"|This is such an interesting topic that I love hearing data on. Having had my first child about a year ago, I am finding my “new” place in my job trying to navigate the pre-tenure life of an academic, while also spending quality time with my family. I am incredibly lucky to be working in a hugely supportive environment where I have had nothing but love and support since I announced my pregnancy. Instead, it is me who is being more selective and stepping back from opportunities I normally would have gleefully accepted. I think that’s also an interesting aspect of a woman’s career post children, because there can truly be a priority shift away from 100% career driven.|What kills me is that everyone needed to be born. These policies discriminate against our own mothers. Every human walking the Earth benefitted from someone's pregnancy. My experience is that moms are MORE committed, efficient, organized,compassionate, and grateful for their jobs. They are BETTER employees because of their pregnancy experience, not in spite of it.",62

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Women’s health has been and continues to be neglected. There is #genderbias in medicine. We must right the ship. It is time for a #metoo moment in women’s healthcare.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Women’s health is ignored in primary care for many reasons. Our broken healthcare system is one. It is impossible to provide high-quality, evidence-based #genderspecific women’s primary health care in current healthcare delivery models. Employed primary care physicians working on RVU driven, volume driven compensation models see on average 28 patients per day and spend 7 minutes with each patient. Primary care providers receive minimal women’s health training.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The consequences of failing to recognize the gender-specific needs of women are numerous. Women turn to alternative care practices, online care, non-evidence based therapies, or they just don’t get care. We must do more and do better.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
@ms_medicine plans to be the solution to this crisis in care. Through our 3 platforms- an innovative practice model, provider education and consumer engagement we plan to elevate the care of women.

308,"Gender bias clearly continues to exist, unfortunately.  Found this article interesting in Psychiatric News this month as it highlights some of the research over the last few years substantiating that women in medicine are not treated equally to their male counterparts
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
A JAMA report from 2016 reported that women physicians were paid on average $20,000 less a year even after adjusting for factors such as speciality
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The Journal of General Internal Medicine published an article that revealed gender-based differences in the language used to evaluate students, even among those who received the same grade. “Evaluations of women students were more likely to include descriptors of personality traits such as “lovely,” while evaluations of male students tended to focus on competency-related attributes such as “scientific” and “knowledgeable.””
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This article highlights the wide gender gap that continues to exist not only in compensation but advancement despite women making up 53% of medical school admissions in 2017! 😡

➡️Women are not ""naturally more interested in family"" and men are not ""more inclined toward careers""
➡️Women only got the vote and the right to attend college/not be discriminated against at work or school within the last *100 years*
➡️Addressing systematic discrimination, harrassment, and discouragement IS CLOSING the gap. If that wasn't the problem, if women naturally were disinclined toward careers and STEM, the gender gap wouldn't be closing.

My mom didn't realize how far she could go in studying math until she was in her 40s because she was constantly discouraged by people saying things like ""Well, girls aren't good at math anyway, so don't worry about passing pre calc"" and focusing all of their attention on helping young men. I think about what she could have done if her natural predisposition for STEM had been nurtured. I wonder if she would have had to depend financially on abusive men.",90
314,"Amanda O’Donnell is the Chief Operating Officer of VoteRunLead, a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that trains women to run for office (and win). Before stepping into her current role, Amanda spent over a decade as a founding partner of Control Group, the company which had the winning bid on LinkNYC, transforming all pay phones in NYC into free WiFi kiosks. In this episode, Amanda discusses modes of disrupting male-dominated spaces by breaking down barriers and biases and creating pathways for female leadership at all levels; she also touches on the importance of truly valuing the unique female perspective and finding your authentic “why”. @acw_odonnell .

322,"Many parents, including myself, have been told that their son’s physical, disruptive, or misbehavior is because “he’s just being a boy.” To be honest, my son’s school teacher  chalked up a lot of his rambunctious, yet teachable behavior, to his gender. That to me, was a disservice to my son and allowed me no insight into what he may have been feeling.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If we continue to explain away behavior as the perceived normal for that gender, we are preventing children from understanding their actual feelings.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I recently listened to @janetlansbury’s podcast where she hosted best selling author of Mothering Boys – Secrets to Understanding Our Sons⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Maggie Dent. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
She mentions new research findings that show that if a girl or a woman gets upset, her limbic brain fires, but the next center that fires up is her word center, which is why girls are very quick to express how they are feeling using words.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For boys and men, it’s the limbic brain followed by the body, so boys are thought to sooner go and kick something rather than be able to express using words. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
While there are found to be gender differences, this does not mean that all people don’t equally feel their emotions on a deep level. If we chalk up the reaction to those emotions, to a simple gender label, are we really getting to the root of it? My answer is no.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

It’s funny because we had this vision of not influencing them to be ‘girly girls’ and to an extent we were trying to avoid dolls and princesses etc, but they were just drawn to them at playgroups and friends houses, and then we realised that there must be something innate that just means little girls just love pretending to be Mummies!

333,"I have thought about this topic often, yet never in this exact way...But it is 100% true!!! No wonder like we feel like we have to do it all!  But what REALLY gets me is that it is a TOTAL double standard when it comes to men!  No one expects them to raise children as if they don't work!  Oh no!  That is a WOMAN'S work! 😠  Double standards and gender biases are getting REALLY old REALLY fast!

I guarantee that no one shames my husband for working, not one but, TWO jobs instead of being home with his son!  Yet I still get judged for being a working mother with ONE job!  Why do none of the household-running or child-rearing responsibilities fall on men??? It is 2019 for fuck's sake!  More and more women are working outside of the home (mainly because most people can't survive on one income anymore), and more and more Dads are staying at home with the kids.  And we are the ones who get unfairly judged and seen as either a lacking Mother who cares more about her career than her family, or a whipped Dad who clearly couldn't support his family financially and had no other choice but to stay home!

We need to start doing more to change these double standards/gender biases!  And husbands and wives need to start working together more to be a TEAM, instead of two individuals who only take on the gender-normative roles of life!  If Moms want to be ball-busting CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and Dads want to be loving caretakers/homemakers, more power to you all!",genderbias,|#firsttimemamawithamouth #momlife #wifelife #workingmomlife #genderbias #doublestandards #weneedachange #canwedoboth #teamworkmakesthedreamwork #shanitahubbard #imfedup #impossiblestandards #legalassistant #stillstruggling #stopmomshaming #dowhatyoulove #behappy,4
334,"Today’s #truthbombtuesday looks at the disparity in wait times between men and women when being referred to a specialist.

A 2007 national study identified patient- and provider-related factors associated with waiting time for an initial specialist consultation about a new condition. Not surprisingly, waiting time varied with the nature of the condition, with generally shorter waits for those that were potentially life-threatening.

But even when the influence of this variable was taken into account, the results highlight significant differences in waiting times by sex, source of referral, and for male patients, household income and immigration status.

Where 51 per cent of men see a specialist within a month, only 42 per cent of womxn have their first specialist appointment within that time frame. This could result from systemic gender biases in access to health care services, evidence of which has previously been demonstrated.

When I saw this moment, I wondered how much does this moment matter? It was hard to use the hose sprayer balance the toy and get the water in. It struck me this moment matters a lot. .
Small challenges accomplished and complex movements build ability, coordination, and confidence. This capable little human can figure out how to fill up. It’s in my parenting to let them try things and do things.

How much do we do too much for kids?  cause we know how, cause it’s faster. How often does bias like gender jump in during a moment like this? How more often do adults help a girl in one of these moments? We all need space to experience doing hard things.

@movebetterplaymore Speaks often “we can do hard things”  Why are hard things hard to do?  This moment shows me there is a physical history or lack of actually DOing hard things. Complex changing movements lead to the confidence. It’s built on experience in the body.

336,"COSTUME CONUNDRUM  Disney truly is one of the most magical places and companies on Earth, I’m always in awe watching our kids at the parks or seeing their faces light up watching the newest movie. Over the years, our biggest challenge has been costumes. Our daughters have wanted to get the full princess experience at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique (hair, makeup, nails, and costume/t-shirt &tutu), but their sizing is a challenge because Disney only offers up to children’s size 13. I’ve inquired at multiple locations, asking at Disneyland, Disney Springs, and on Disney Cruise Line, even checking costume sizing at Disney Stores and this is the max. So, what does that mean for the little girl that is in the age range, (3-12), but needs a size that’s larger than that???? The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique and Disney store/shopDisney costume sizing is not representative of different body types of our children. I decided to reach out to Disney to help solve our conundrum. ————————————————————————————————————————————————My email: “Hi,  A question that I’ve been curious about for a bit as I’ve asked at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutiques on DCL, Disneyland, and Disney Springs is the sizing for princess dresses and tutu/t-shirt combo that are available at the boutiques. Ive been told that sizing only goes up to a 12 or 13 depending on the style and our daughters are larger than those sizes. I feel that the limitation of sizes excludes many children that want to participate but are larger than the sizing offered. Just want to reach out because we cannot be the only family encountering this problem. I would love to help be part of the solution to make the full experience inclusive to all kids, regardless of sizing.

345,"Reviewing survey data and feeling a surge of hope at hypothesis being validated and in general, the possibility for girls in our country. 
The question was pretty simple - ""Imagine you are head of the family. Swetha and Sunil are your two kids. They are both 18 year olds. You have money to educate one of them. They are both good in their studies. Which one will you choose and why?"" I picked this question from an RCT done in Haryana to measure gender attitudes in adolescents. While in Haryana, most kids chose the male ( he will take care of family but the girl will get married), in peri-urban Bangalore, it has unanimously been the girl as a choice. 
The first answer has my heart. This girl is a distinctly dark skinned girl and possibly has been bullied. She passionately believes that the girl should be educated so that she can overcome her teasing and her skin color won't matter anymore. 
I'm hopeful today. Time to get the intervention started. 
I'm going to share the results soon in a pie-chart, so comment yes, if interested. Also, if you need the survey and are willing to conduct it with 8t and 9th grades, please DM me.

As a doctor I was shocked to learn some of the stats about medications not even working on female bodies (I’m sorry WHY are we not being taught this and why are we not correcting it). I’m shocked that when I previously did scientific research I didn’t even think to gender-segregate my data at a phase 1 level - the impacts down the line could be huge. This isn’t a book I would have chosen myself (especially after a little non-fiction burnout recently), but was a wonderful birthday gift.

Today's prompt for the #WeAreSTEMsquad Make Space challenge is #Inclusive and I want to talk about what it means to be an inclusive STEMINIST. Being pro-gender equality in STEM means you want:
✔️ Equal pay (!!)
✔️ An accepting space for LGBTQIA+ and non-gender conforming individuals
✔️ Zero tolerance for sexual harassment or discrimination of ANY kind
✔️ Recognition of preferred pronouns

In addition to these things, STEMINISTS want STEM to be more accessible for mothers and to stop discriminating against women who have/want children. Affordable childcare, reasonable work schedules, and supportive attitudes are just a few things that will help keep mothers in STEM. Please go follow @mothersinscience for more on that, as well as @also_ascientist for more on facilitating an inclusive community in #STEM. @thestemsquad .

In the last week I read a research paper that hit me, and hard. 
In a paper called ""When do we confront"", it was found that confrontation was a function of status and familiarity and nature of affront. Women were more likely to confront sexism when it came from.someone familiar and were peers. 
But here's the uncomfortable truth. They created a typology of the type of sexism and created 3 - a. Sexist remarks b. Unfairness c. Sexual attention. 
Women were less likely to confront when it is sexual attention. While the paper did not deep dive into this nugget, it got me thinking. 
How frightening it is, that somewhere deep down, we still believe that we are responsible for the dress down that we get. For the contours of our body. For the biological shape of our body. Sexuality was never about nudity. Skin is skin is skin and nothing more. 
Women, confront. Their eyes undressing is a remark on their immaturity, not on your virtue. But you already know this, Don't you?

375,"Women Deserve Equal Pay💰Period. 
Unfortunately the Patriarchy Still Lives on in 2019 👎🏼 .
.
Women are still paid on average only 77% of what men are paid for the same job. The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963, when women were only paid 59% of what men were. We have only narrowed the gap by 18 cents in over 50 years! Calculated over 15 years, a woman makes nearly $500,000 LESS on average than a man getting paid more for the same work. Women are forced into “pink collar” jobs, which affects wage earnings over time and face bias if they are working mothers on top of this direct pay discrimination. Employer practices of setting current pay on salary history further compounds this problem. .
.
When I asked for fair pay in my last role, I was continually denied. When I explained my reasoning included that I was not paid fairly when I handed in my resignation, the response I received was, “I thought you were just frustrated”. Because a woman asking for fair pay is viewed as nagging? extra? venting? Clearly we still need to fight to be seen as equals. Women are continually faced with gender inequalities such as this and and it is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. We must continue to raise our voices together and fight against these inequities. And we must have the courage to leave for better opportunities that value our talents and contributions. .

380,"⁣⁣ Press Ganey Scores 😮! ⁣⁣
A by product of the 2012 Affordable Care Act.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Patient satisfaction scores such as the Press- Ganey score are now ubiquitous.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Health cate systems use these as marketing tools - ⁣⁣
“ come see us for your health care needs, we have top rated doctors“!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
They are also used as part of physician compensation - ⁣⁣
“ your scores are low, you are a bad doctor, we are going to pay you $3 less per work value unit . Shame on you,be nicer,be more compassionate”! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
You want to know the truth ?⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Gender and racial Bias exists in scoring. Big surprise ?!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Also guess what - high Scores do no indicate better physician outcomes!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Swipe to see some recent studies on this (many are from Stanford epidemiologist)⁣⁣
⁣⁣
1️⃣. Asian patients give  doctors lower scores . It doesn’t matter if their doctor is Asian or white .In fact Asians are pickier than all of the other ethnic  groups  including White , Hispanic and African American patients🧐. So if you are a doctor with a large Asian population, you will get lower scores than if you see Caucasian or other ethnic patients according to this study.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
2️⃣. Patients like gray hair - older doctors get higher scores than docs < 44 yo⁣⁣
⁣⁣
3️⃣. Another study from the Stanford  OB/Gyn department showed that women OB/Gyn were 47% less likely to receive top box scores compared to their male counterparts. Obviously all the patients were women 😔. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
4️⃣. In this same study : patients are more likely to rate a doctor highly if they belong to the same ethnic group and age group as the doctor .⁣⁣
⁣⁣
5️⃣.Long wait times annoy patients and they are more likely to rate EVERY aspect of their encounter negatively - including perception of how competent or caring their doctor is !⁣⁣
⁣⁣
6️⃣. Finally - high patient satisfaction scores in the ER are more likely to result in patients being admitted ,increase health care costs by 9% and guess what - INCREASE 1 year mortality!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
So whether you are a patient or a physician or a healthcare administrator: take these scores with a grain of salt ⁣⁣

I find these scores so subjective and it can be so hard to explain to a patient that NOT giving out the drug she wants is actually the best care, yet it may leave her unsatisfied bc she didn’t get what she wanted....which is reflected in the Press Ganey. 🙄 I try to live by the mantra that I’m a good doctor and it will come through, but I know these systems are so flawed!|It’s incredible that I have witnessed or directly experienced this.

I’m looked on as a young ethnic doctor that is telling them what they don’t want to hear.

Then the Press Ganey and HCAHPS scoring systems came in and patient ""satisfaction"" was totally lost. That is no longer the goal. These are often ""top box"" scoring systems that are part of a payment LIMITING plan. CMS just looking for ways to limit reimbursement to the lower 50th percentile. ""Top box"" is a MARKETING tool that works well for brand loyalty but is not a ""satisfaction"" measure. Doctors are treated like car salesmen with these ratings. I do well, but I simply ignore them.

Ratings are so biased by many different factors.|Thank you so much for this valuable information!  It boggles my mind that if I receive a lower than a 93 percentile on my PG scores, I don’t receive my incentive pay from my company.

386,"❛Most feminist religion & SC❜： ▶❝Hindu Wife Can’t Inherit Muslim Husband’s Property, Rules SupremeCourt.❞
❝If a Hindu woman enters into a matrimonial with a Muslim man without converting to Islam beforehand, the marriage would neither be “regular” nor “valid”, under the existing laws.  While the wife in such a case will be entitled to dower (mehr) , she cannot inherit her husband’s property, the Supreme Court (SC) has ruled.❞
▶Under the Muslim law, a marriage is a civil contract which can be broken at the will of the parties concerned. Under the Islamic laws（Muslim Personal Laws）, there are three types of nikaah (marriage) ─ valid, irregular and void. A marriage that follows all the prerequisites set under the law is a legal or sahih marriage. An irregular marriage, known as a fasid marriage, takes place when the two parties fail to fulfil the prerequisite norms to make it valid. If a Muslim marries for the fourth time, for instance, it would be a fasid marriage. Similarly, if there are no witnesses to the ceremony, the marriage would be held irregular under the Islamic law. A marriage that involves taking the consent of either party forcefully is considered void. Children born out of such wedlock have no right in their father’s property.

396,"Last September, Donte Palmer’s Instagram post showing him kneeling on a bathroom floor while trying to change his young child’s diaper went viral.⠀
.⠀
It’s a challenge almost any father can relate to as a recent study found upwards of 90 percent of dads have gone into a men’s public restroom trying to change their child’s diaper only to find no changing station is available.⠀
.⠀
Palmer’s post helped launch the #squatforchange hashtag movement which caught the eyes of Pampers.⠀
.⠀
So, Pampers has decided to do something about it by committing to placing 5,000 new changing stations in men’s public restrooms across the U.S. and Canada by 2021. And they’ve enlisted musician John Legend to help raise awareness for the campaign.⠀

Karachi-based Ayesha Tariq is a multidisciplinary artist who dabbles in improv, stand-up comedy, drama, illustration, music and is curious about more, “and sometimes nothing at all.” She is best known for her book Sarah: The Suppressed Anger of The Pakistani Obedient Daughter (Penguin India, 2015), which she has written and illustrated. 
The book, a hilarious take on the struggles of being a Pakistani girl, happened after Ayesha had a fight with her family. She then made a list of things that she and her women friends went through on a daily basis – hypocrisy in society, sexual abuse and gender biases. ""Whenever I have put my work out there, someone has connected with it, and I think it comforts me that my work is able to open up a space to start a conversation. Conversations make the world a safer place. There is a big power in sharing your narrative; it invites connection, love and personal and communal growth,” she says.

400,"I had the privilege to be a part of an excellent learning session at Vodafone Idea Ltd. today. 
There is no such thing as a typical behaviour of a gender. We have been brought up to believe that men, women and transgenders are supposed to behave in a particular way. If they don't, they are outliers and need to be corrected or tamed. 
It's time this bias be removed from the society at large, not just the workplace.
It's completely acceptable for a man to cry and a woman to smoke.
It's extremely normal for a man to cook dinner and the woman to ignore the kitchen to watch her favourite TV show.
It's really okay for a man to be compassionate and a woman to be aggressive. 
You need to accept these as signs of human-kind and not a gender specific behaviour. You are not ""supposed"" to do things for being born as a male/female/transgender. Do what you are comfortable at, what you are best at. The world will have no option but to accept your excellence. 
Eliminate this Unconscious bias: the sooner, the better!

401,"Whatever you raise them to be! 
A few days ago a male child (under 10) came to our place, it wasn't his first time and not even his 5th time so I'm sure he was quite familiar with the apartment. He had just returned from school and was waiting for his mum, he had left over food that he wanted to eat so he told another child (a female relative) who lives in our compound with her family, was his age and was very familiar with the house to get him a spoon. She stood up went into the kitchen and gave him one, he looked at it with disgust and said ""don't you know you are supposed to rinse it.""
All this while I was in the living room with them watching everything to see what will happen. 
The girl then went back into the kitchen and when I heard the tap come on in the kitchen , I stood up, went to meet her and told her to drop the spoon. 
Went back into the living room and told the boy to go into the kitchen and pick up his own spoon. No time!!!😀😀 It didnt help that the girl and her younger sister were crushing on him and kept blushing sheepishly throughout his stay 😏😏
Guys let's stop extreme gender stereotypes! A man can clean up after himself and cook his own meals and a Lady can pay her own bills. Men can be emotional and women can be independent and self confident and it all starts with how you raise them. #oyinhunnie #genderbias #genderroles

403,"It was incredible when men, women and children, chanted ""#EqualPay"" in the stadium as the @fifaworldcup president took the stage. It is 2019 and it is shameful to have to demand  #respect and '#equality for the #athletes. #fifawomensworldcup and the #ussoccer federation should step up and give what athletes deserved for their hard work. 
It made me proud to see so many young people screaming #EqualPay. I can only hope that in a very near future, there will be no need to scream equal pay.

410,"The gender bias that is breaking the networks.

This week was the semi-final of the women's world championship where the USA champions faced the powerful England, the Internet went crazy to criticize the American players Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, for celebrating their goals, they were called arrogant and rude, on the contrary, this same week Cristiano Ronaldo also celebrated his goal and Antoine Griezmann celebrated with the “looser dance” his goal, and nobody mentioned them on the news. With the women social networks exploded in memes and criticism, so they are saying women can not celebrate victories?

This bias suggests that women should be humble and not talk about their successes, and when a man does it is even celebrated and imitated, for example in this case, this limiting belief stops us in equity and makes us give One step back, let's celebrate with women their successes, let's shout it out loud, women can also be successful without fear of being judged as arrogant.

And how would you face this gender bias? #leanin #genderbias #genderequity #alexmorgan #meganrapinoe #doublestandards",genderbias,"|Lol Cristiano gets criticized everytime. Now after the finals Alex Morgan is twerking in front the camera.

416,"""When asked about achieving gender parity in politics -- in light of the one-third female court and historic number of women elected to Congress during the last midterms -- Ginsburg acknowledged the advances as ""impressive numbers,"" but not enough.

Ginsburg said that while ""almost all of those explicit barriers"" facing women that she fought against in the 1970s are gone, ""what remains is what's often been called unconscious bias."" She cited an example of conducting orchestra auditions behind a curtain to combat a sexist music critic. ""Sadly, we can't duplicate the dropped curtain"" in electoral politics, she said, later adding that ""for women employed today outside the home, unconscious bias is there."""" --- FOR THE ENTIRE ARTICLE:

- More than 5x more likely to use drugs
- 71% of high school dropouts
- 90% of homeless and runaway youth
- 85% of youth in prisons
- Dad deprivation is the single biggest predictor of suicide

Boys given *EQUAL TIME* with their biological fathers: - Less than one-fifth as likely to use drugs
- Increased verbal development
- Higher scores in math and science
- Greater ability to empathize with others
- More likely to graduate high school
- More likely to attend and graduate college ***

424,"I’ve never been a fan of the word ‘tolerance’ in reference to diversity and inclusion. Tolerance implies that a dominant culture is somehow doing you a favor by allowing you to exist, like a pesky nuisance. I tolerate mosquitos, not people. If I am tolerating a person, then I really don’t want them around. Is that the message you want to send to your colleagues, employees, neighbors, and customers? “Hey, you aren’t actually welcome here, but we will just let it happen. And honestly, you are pretty annoying.” ....................................................................................................................................... I think not. Whether it’s about adjusting to non-binary and transgender pronouns, or any other aspect of culture and identity that is different from you. The marginalized among us are no longer interested in tolerating your biased and bigoted attitudes. Wait, did that hurt? Exactly, being tolerated is an insult. We don’t like it either.
....................................................................... And if you are in a workplace or any other situation where you feel you are being tolerated, start brushing up your resume or re-evaluating your relationships and looking around for environments that cultivate a sense of belonging for all people. We should all feel welcomed, included, and valued. If you are still using the word tolerance when you mean inclusion and belonging, please ditch that word immediately. It’s a microaggression in my humble opinion.

It’s so shocking it affects them so young!|This is so sad. My girls started spouting stereotypes a few months ago with regards to gender, I realised that, although I am totally against this, I wasn’t actively exposing them enough to anything that broke down these stereotypes. So, I went through our books, gave loads to charity and filled our bookcases with quality books that promote equality and inclusion. My daughter said to me the other day, ‘Girls can wear trousers, they don’t have to wear skirts and boys can wear skirts if they want.’ A big step for a little one who thought they had to wear a skirt/dress to be pretty! I had no idea she had these opinions before but they are exposed to stereotypes all time. Consider me totally woke!!|My heart sank reading this. 
As the mother of both a girl and a boy it’s something very much at the forefront of my mind.
At home we challenge stereotypes all the time but what about the rest of the time. My daughter is at nursery and obviously comes into contact with other people who don’t hold the same views as us, it’s like fighting a lose battle!|I had my first you can’t do that because you’re not big and strong you’re a girl from my three year old the other week 😢 daddy has actually been the one to step in and correct him on this. We’ve also had a little chat about our shed not being his ‘man cave’. We try to dress both children relatively gender neutral, have open ended toys, both have dolls and I’m already promoting stem in our play. Trying to do my best for my daughter and my son!|What happens later? Because it becomes the other way around in teenage years. Are we gonna talk about that?|I read ‘good night for rebel girls’ with my toddler twin boys, all the time! They need to learn how awesome girls can be!! 💪🏻👏🏻❤️",121
434,"One of the AREA’s long standing members, #BrainXChange, who oragnize the #Enterprise #Wearables #Technology Summit (#EWTS) regularly publishes content on enterprise wearables. A recent piece by Emily Friedman is well worth a read.  It looks at sexism in the workplace and specifically in design of wearables and other #tech products that put women at a disadvantage. This well researched and written piece is surely worth a read by all designers, producers and enterprises to increase awareness of #genderbias.

Friedman writes: “My main point then was that wearable technologies – the body-worn sensors being integrated into organizations’ EHS efforts, exoskeletons taking a load off workers’ backs, and VR headsets being hailed as the future of job training – exhibit coded patriarchy and risk further alienating the female workforce. Wearables that are replacing or supplementing traditional #PPE(personal protective equipment) cannot succumb to the same biased or negligent design as have automobiles, office buildings, etc., for the future economy and growth of the workforce depend upon improving job prospects and working environments for women.” The author takes us through the history of man, why this is more than product #ergonomics, the data gap at the heart of the workplace, PPE in the workplace, how designing needs to change in future, and how uncomfortable lead to unproductive which ultimately impacts everyone in the enterprise.

440,"One size fits men. The repercussions and research story are in my link in bio. Every woman should read it. Male partners should read it. Be armed. ~ Women are more likely to die from some diseases because they don’t have the same symptoms as (you guessed it) men.
~ Endometriosis: It takes an average of 8 years to diagnose in the UK, an average of 10 years to diagnose in the US, and there is currently no cure. And although the disease is thought to affect 1 in 10 women (176 million worldwide) it took until 2017 for England’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to release its first ever guidance to doctors for dealing with it. The main recommendation? “Listen to women.”
~ The evidence that women are being let down by the medical establishment is overwhelming. The bodies, symptoms and diseases that affect half the world’s population are being dismissed, disbelieved and ignored. And it’s all a result of the data gap combined with the still prevalent belief, in the face of all the evidence that we do have, that men are the default humans. Data collected on them does not, cannot, and should not, apply to women.

That BASIC question would trigger my anxiety and it would hang like a cloud for DAYS!

Last night, I spoke at the @mamatribelove Popup Party on a panel with @julescoffey_ & @justanothermummyblog and guess what I spoke about?

MENTAL HEALTH and SELF CARE.

Not triggered.
Just empowered to own my journey and share it with a wonderful group of mamas.

We discussed things like feeding our babies, setting boundaries with family and friends, returning to work with gender bias, mama guilt, how we “balance” it all (spoiler: WE DON’T) and much more!

There's a biased notion that women aren't strong enough to lead or to handle the knockdown fights of politics. These women are proving otherwise. ⁠
⁠
They're also not shying away from emotion. Many women work hard to keep their feelings in check out of fear of being dismissed as ""too emotional."" But these women showed passion, grief, even anger -- and they didn't apologize for it. ⁠
⁠
Finally, it makes a huge difference to have more than one woman in the race. ⁠
⁠
When there's just one woman, she carries all the burdens, biases, and expectations that comes with representing an entire gender. When there are six, we stop seeing any of them as The Woman Candidate. They're simply candidates. ⁠
⁠
It frees them up to be who they are and frees us up to evaluate them based on what really matters: their ideas and experience. ⁠

According to a recent study in Harvard Business Review, women who asked for a raise obtained it just 15% of the time, while men obtained a pay increase 20% of the time.🙄 More and more women are assetively asking to get their money, but we still aren't getting it at the same rate as our male counterparts.

To this day, women's asks for more are still treated differently than men's and while we don't have the hard data to know why, we can make a lot of assumptions.

While these stats suck, there is one key item we must remember- we can't get more if we don't ask (even though statistically we are less likely to get it) so 👏 you 👏 must 👏 ask.

Oh, and also promote more women so we can be in leadership positions and flip the script on shitty stats like this.

456,"Beginning to break the chains of patriarchy can begin the journey to break the gender inequality and promote equal rights for females.

Patriarchy is a sheer stupidity where the social norms promotes that a father & son go out to earn for the family and sisters to stay home and neither study or pursue career. This in turn leads to the girls not able to unlock their potential.

Fathers who help unlock their daughter’s potential, standing up for their rights and raising them to believe they have them, bring prosperity and happiness to their entire families. And that infact is the beginning of promoting Gender Equality.

Fathers can set an example and play a crucial role in the fight for women’s rights and bring gender equality just the way Malala Yousafazi's father became an exemplary father to take a stand.

467,"Can you guess where we will be as of June 29?

Come and meet us at the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology in Oslo. This year’s theme is Neuroinflammation, a very “hot” topic for neurological disorders! We now know that inflammation has been involved in the cause of most neurological disorders,  such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, ALS, epilepsy, movement disorders, stroke and migraine. A better understanding of the mechanisms will provide new insights into the causes of neurological diseases and open new treatments for our patients.

Did you know that 2/3 of Alzheimer’s patients are females? Is this distribution reflected in the number of women entering clinical trials against Alzheimer’s? Maria-Teresa Ferretti, our CSO, will be presenting at the EAN, showing that recently failed clinical trials do not reflect this distribution as they show an average of 50% women and 50% men. Lack of sex consideration might hinder the trials’ ability to detect a drug’s clinical efficacy.

Come by and say “hi” 👋 and learn more about WBP!

And that's before you take into account the fact that over 60% of African American kids live with a single mom. Keep all this in mind when someone asks ""who raised y'all?!""

488,"Julian is a mermaid - the message, the characters and the illustrations are all just so utterly beautiful. 
Julian sees three beautiful mermaids when he is out and about with his grandmother. He is fascinated about them so much so that he sees himself as one. Once they are back home and his grandmother is having her bath, Julian makes himself a mermaid costume with leaves and curtain drapes.His grandmother is back from her bath and is surprised to see him dressed as a mermaid but what she does next is a great reminder for all of us- acceptance! She brings him a necklace to go with his outfit and takes him to meet the mermaids as she knows he belongs there and it makes him happy. 
The simple analogy to mermaids can really be anything - gender stereotyped play, non conforming ideals of gender identity, gender self exploration or even any belief or passion that is not necessarily relatable to one.

Acceptance is really the key and maybe just what is needed to assure that he/she is not alone but have a supportive and welcoming community to hold his/her back at any cost.

494,"How many times have you been to the doctor’s and you have been told that “it’s nothing” or “it’s just stress”? Women are more likely to be misdiagnosed, not been taken seriously or be told that they are just “too sensitive.” Men, also, are likely to be misdiagnosed and they are less likely to receive mental health services, when it comes to depression, for example.

Sofia is 42 years old and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 3 years ago - it was a struggle as she was misdiagnosed and not believed by doctors. Her dad had died from the disease in 1999, his brother died from the same disease 7 years later and her grandmother too. She was tired so she was told she had iron deficiency and there was nothing to worry about. She was given some medicine which, of course, didn’t work! A year and a half later she got a correct diagnosis after contacting her dad’s retired physician! “It was horrible not to be taken seriously” Sofia said during WBP’s Forum on June 8-9 and pointed out that there are many challenges of young-onset Alzheimer’s patients and especially women’s encounters.

Education for doctors on how to communicate with men vs. women is key to address issues of under- and over-diagnosis in mental and brain disorders. This is one of the topics that the Women’s Brain Project advocates for and wants to increase awareness across all the relevant stakeholders to achieve better healthcare for all people suffering from brain and mental disease.

•
In my early 20's, I was an immigrant in the USA; I experienced first-hand what diversity is, especially when living in a very dense and cosmopolitan area like New York City. Also, I represented 1% of Swiss students on my campus. Later on, as a young professional, I was very aware of the glass ceiling and the lack of many female role models / mentors. Today in my current role, I often am one of the few women in a room when attending conferences. Be it in the media, watchmaking, or #innovation sectors, #genderbias still widely predominate. When speaking of the revolution 4.0, what does it mean if women do not help shape tomorrow's world? #STEM careers still attract many more men than women. #Technology will then be designed mainly for men, with men in mind, and the #stereotypes will survive if we don't foster change. Hence my involvement with @weshapetech.

Como saben, estuve en #Turquía por la reunión global del área que llevo en mi vida de Mamá Godín ®

Estaba feliz de reencontrarme con mis líderes globales, conocer a los nuevos del equipo. Sólo dos personas de los que viajamos, eran de Turquía.

El resto representabamos países en Asia, Europa, Oceanía y América.

El primer día, nuestra jefa mundial, quien es mujer, se acercó a saludarme. Pudimos platicar un poco sobre mis dos roles y le pedí asesoría para un tema. Terminamos hablando sobre nuestros hijos y nos fuimos a comer.

Al día siguiente la busqué para dar seguimiento a la conversación y no la encontré - ""Tuvo que irse"" me comentaron. No pregunté más.

Ya en el aeropuerto, le escribí WhatsApp para agradecerle por la invitación. Me contestó que había tenido que irse pronto por una infección en el estómago de su hijo.

Siempre les he dicho que todo comunica, mi jefa global, en ese momento nos dejó claro a todos cuál es la prioridad en la vida.

Me siento muy afortunada de pertenecer a este equipo que te permite priorizar y enfocarte en lo realmente importante, sin que eso demerite tu ascenso en la escalera corporativa.

500,"This is a total BS. The ONLY “have to” in life is we have to live and we have to die. Everything else is a choice. You don’t HAVE TO unless you WANT TO. While men 👨🏻 are “expected” to BE providers, protectors, and sperm donors, women 🧑🏻 are also “expected” to provide, protect, and produce the 🥚s. That’s “social conditioning” embeded in our “patriarchal” (male) culture. Men provide; women produce. منه المال و منها العيال You can either give people what they “expect” or you can make your life interesting. —————————————————————
If you think you CAN, you’re right. If you think you CANNOT, you’re probably right too. 👉🏼 YOU ARE WHAT YOU THINK. It’s called self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think all men have to BE a certain way, then that’s what they’ll be. If you think all women have to LOOK  a certain way, then that’s what they’ll be. 👉🏼 We get what we expect. ———————————————————
She 👥 confronts. He 🏃🏾‍♂️avoids. 
She multi-tasks. He’s laser-focused. 
She regrets things she has done. 
He regrets things he has NOT done. 
She wears her heart on her sleeve. 
He tucks it away. 
These are stereotypes, NOT scientific data. Men and women are different because of “societal” upbringing, NOT because of gender. 👉🏼 Values are caught, NOT taught. We are the by-product of our society. It’s called “social conditioning.” Gender is Godmade. Traits are Manmade. 👉🏼 We LEARN what we LIVE. We live it; we become it 🐒. So, if men or women behave a certain way, it’s because they were raised by the same patriarchal cultural yardstick. They’re “mirroring” their parents, culture, and society. This has nothing to do with what’s between their legs. It’s time to name things by their names and call a spade a spade. —————————————————————

The Women’s Brain Project wants to raise awareness on sex and gender differences in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders in order to improve assessment, drug development and treatment for women by engaging and influencing the right stakeholders.

507,"June 19, 2019 was the 50th anniversary of Australia’s industrial relations system endorsing the principle of “equal pay for equal work”. Yet, five decades on, a gender pay gap remains.⠀
.⠀
The 1969 decision was a breakthrough, but also highlighted the problem of putting principle into practice, given a legacy of past decisions being based on clear notions of “male” and “female” jobs.⠀
.⠀
While various factors contribute to the overall gender pay gap, about 30% is due to gender concentrations by industry and occupation.⠀
.⠀
Decisions dating back a century have contributed to the unequal wage patterns we still see today, with female-dominated jobs clustered at the lower end of the pay spectrum.⠀

510,"Director Kenji #Mizoguchi made some very somber #films in the 1950s including Sansho the Bailiff and Ugetsu. He died that same decade, but had a long filmography going back to the silent era and we haven’t watched any of his earlier work. We decided to watch Osaka Elegy from #1936. It’s a story that is just as frustratingly relevant today as it was in the #1930s. I can only speak from an American point of view, but society holds a different standard for men compared to women. What is acceptable for the one, especially when it comes to promiscuity, is not acceptable for the other. In this #movie, Ayako is propositioned by her boss to become his mistress. A disgusting case of harassment that is treated as normal. Her father is in financial trouble after getting caught stealing from his employer, so she accepts her boss’s offer and uses the money to pay off his debt. She’s in love with a young man that proposed to her, but she declined, too afraid of what he’d think about her situation. She gets a chance to free herself when the bosses wife cuts the affair off. Unfortunately, her brother’s school tuition was due and she found another man to pay her as a mistress. She used that money to ensure her brother could finish school. She is eventually arrested for prostitution (the men propositioning her are not arrested) and she’s treated as trash by her family and love interest. “I didn’t realize she was such a terrible woman!” Is what he says about her while she cries in the other room. Only days before, he wanted to marry her. He never talks to her about why and it shouldn’t matter anyway! A #film like this angers you, but speaks such profound truths that it stays in your memory. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",genderbias,|#kenjimizoguchi #osakaelegy #movies #moviereview #moviereviews #japan #japanese #tokyo #misogyny #genderbias #blackandwhite #classicmovie #ilovemovies #welovemovies,16

512,"Artificial intelligence is predominantly developed by white males: At Facebook just 15% of the company’s AI staff are women, at Google, only 10%. What's the problem with that? A growing body of research shows that machines can amplify human biases. The lack of diversity is causing artificial intelligence to have biases against non-white males, for example discriminating against women when used for the evaluation of CVs. 
Great insights today at the CFO Forum in Nicosia on this and other aspects transforming the way we work, live, socialise and communicate.

513,"boys don't cry"" ""be a man"" ""act like a big boy""
We as a society send a very wrong message to our boys from very early age. We teach them It's not oke that they express their emotion, or not even feel anything at the first place. ""Anger"" and "" aggression ""  are the only designated emotion for many men. Do you know what is the impact? -Three most common mental health struggles for men are anxiety, stress and depression -Heart attack rate is higher in men than women -Talking to someone is not one of the coping skills for most of the men -Substance  use rate is much higher in men than women. The ratio is 3:1 and in many cases it is their coping mechanism. -men are less likely to go for a annual check up -Men make up over 75 percent of suicide victim in the United States, with one man killing himself every 20minute.

It's time that we change our attitude towards Men's mental health issues. We need to Improve our health care system and encourage more men to be in the field. Instead of teaching our children to be rough and tough, teach them to be empathetic, and kind. Let them know it's okey if they feel sad, It's oke express love, its oke if they have a soft voice, its okey if they cry. Don't make fun of them if they fall and cry instead help them to get up.

532,"Its difficult but not impossible to accept the changes that women are going through with their bodies today. Life isn't the same as it used to be a couple of decades back. The stress has become unsurmountable. Its no more a life that entails a simple job and coming back home. The challenges that present themselves at every step make lives a little more difficult each day. Right from the food you eat to the daily commute to the skewed work dynamics to the lack of patience in our relationships beyond work to the sheer lack of empathy through and through, each aspect demands more attention than ever.
•
It is an unfortunate state of affairs that employers do not empathize with the situations and often label you as someone who cannot or isn't willing to stretch for long hours. On days when you are writhing in period pain, you cannot just say you have cramps and taking a day off or working from home.

Things do not end here. The gender biases and glass ceiling is so prevalent its not even funny. People are a bit more cognizant of not saying inappropriate things out in the public but it shows. It shows in preferential hiring on the basis of gender; in letting a man lead a high-visibility project; in not having women head departments and units in organizations. Yes there are companies which are more conducive but not most of them! In a country as large as India with most of the urban population working, we are heading no where with these changes that so need to be there.

As i grow up the corporate ladder, the difference seems more predominant than ever! And i wish i didnt have to see it. Well, maybe it is wishful thinking but someday i hope to be able to be in a position to change things a bit! .

535,"""Job vacancies at one of Europe’s leading engineering universities will be open exclusively to female candidates for at least the next 18 months in order to overcome the institution’s “implicit gender bias”. The rector of the Eindhoven University of Technology, Frank Baaijens, said progress towards a better balance of men and women in academic roles had been stubbornly slow.

Under the new recruitment policy, men will only be eligible for any academic post if no suitable female candidates emerge within six months of a job becoming available."" --- FOR THE ENTIRE ARTICLE:

It’s a good day because I absolutely love watching incredible players such as @lokossoo, @rmdalie11, @dusan.bulut, @rebeccajcole, & more ball out and kick ass, it’s bitter because we should have been there. 
Most of you don’t know this, but we, the Jordanian Women’s National 3x3 Basketball Team qualified to the World Cup, after years of competing & racking up points, we ranked as #11 worldwide, and made it to the highest level of competition for the game out there the #3x3WC! 
Not only did this incredible feat go completely unrecognized & uncelebrated, we, the players were not even informed of our remarkable accomplishment. We had to find out from other sources and after multiple ignored phone calls we were able to confront the JOC about this, to which we received your usual “we have no funding”. We responded with a simple, this is the highest level of 3x3 basketball in the world, the most viewed, & the most popular, we’re sure we can find sponsors to cover the expenses, & we’ll help you do so. 
This world cup was an essential step for the ultimate goal of qualifying to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. But still all we got was an unjustified NO. 
Now what? What happened to the #OlympicDream we all shared more more than 2 years ago? 
Since then the JOC has sent 5 different MEN’S teams to 5 different tournaments around the world. Where did the funding come from then?

All I can say is this: Athletes wait, train, practice, & prepare an entire lifetime for a moment like this & we were unduly stripped of this moment! At the very least we deserve an explanation, an apology, and a promise that no other team will have to go through the same injustice ever again.

542,"I hope you’ll forgive me if this is deflating, but I think it’s important for those of you paying attention to know what’s behind the smiles in the pictures.

I loved seeing the positive Happy Fathers Day posts yesterday, and I sincerely appreciate those of you who reached out directly. I was so lucky to have both of mine with me — one of those days you don’t want to end...but the court says 8:00 pm ends my “VISITATION,” so my daughter and I sat on the couch for 2 hours nearly in tears because the clock was ticking. Then I load her up, and we make the 17-20 min ride with broken bouts of silence, usually filled with nervous exchanges about trivial things or empty reassurances about how “at least it won’t be THAT long” or “at least it’s not months like we used to go.” We hug, tear up a little, say goodbye with neighbors observing our private moment — occasionally being interrupted mid-goodbye by her mom — and bid our adieus until a couple days later, when we get the judge-ordered perk of a 15 minute FaceTime.

I get home to a house with a void. My home office is right next to her bedroom, so I see her empty bed every day. And I wonder if Charlotte is doing okay, but with no ability to help if she isn’t.

I’m so sorry for all the dads who would give anything to have the time with my daughter that I do. I don’t mean to minimize you.

Well... It’ll never be easy, but it’ll always be worth it.

554,"One of my favorite methods for sexist/racist/homophobic comments is to make them repeat it over and over again. “Wait, I don’t get it” or “What’s the joke?” Until they’re so unsure and embarrassed that they feel as vulnerable as they make their victims feel. It’s important to me that we’re always educating the people around us, and I always do explain WHY “it’s just a joke” isn’t a justification, but there’s nothing like that sense of vulnerability and discomfort in public, a small taste of the discomfort the rest of us feel when out in the world, surrounded by bigotry and misogyny. •

563,"""For the first time, more than half of all board members appointed to oversee public bodies in Scotland are women.

A 50% target for female representation among non-executive board members by 2022 has been met early.

The goal was set by legislation in March 2018 through the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act.

Of 680 regulated ministerial appointments made to public boards, 341 were women - up from 45% in 2016.

The achievement applies to health boards, enterprise agencies, the Scottish Police Authority, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, colleges and universities."" --- FOR THE ENTIRE ARTICLE:

565,"When boys and girls were asked to draw a scientist in a study several decades ago, the results revealed a stunning bias: 99.4 percent of the drawings depicted a male scientist. Out of 5,000 drawings collected between 1966 and 1977, only 28 were of female scientists, all of which were drawn by girls.

Today, more than half of girls draw a woman when asked to draw a scientist, a number that’s risen steadily since the 1960s.

However, both boys and girls are likely to draw a male scientist as they grow older.

See Hans Rosling’s examples in Factfulness|This doesn’t surprise me at all. Although the external world has changed for women, the subconscious beliefs and hidden assumptions still lag behind and mirror the past. These are still programmed into the world around us. When we go out into the world we pick up those subtle energies and are influenced by them without us realising it.  If you were to say ‘manager, CEO, consultant, barrister, actuary, surgeon’ most people’s minds would still jump first to assume male. Girls today are thankfully brought up with much better expectations on what they can become, but the legacy of the past hasn’t yet been released.  The longer we are exposed to those energies the more they will influence us - hence reverting back to the male assumption as they get older.  I know just how strongly this effect  can undermine women scientists - I lived this one!!!",31

It’s fabulous Friday...and it’s been 11 long weeks.

@awcaseyme is my anchor and a voice of calm in this crazy recovery.

He is also my biggest supporter and he’s become an equally fantastic feminist.

He’s shown me (and those around me) that a strong man can be a strong proponent for the vulnerable, for minorities, for gender equality...while staying a strong man.

How did he get here?  By learning.  By opening his heart...and his mind.

By watching my breast reconstruction battle.  By watching the damage and surgeries caused from Essure.  By witnessing BII.  By reading about medical bias in studies.  By understanding that breast implants are killing women in the name of beauty.  By caring and fighting for my ailing mom.  For standing by me, surgery after surgery.  By watching me fight to find a post-mastectomy bra or clothes that fit my flat chest.  By fighting for equal post-operative treatments that will help me heal.  By educating himself on diversity, gender biases and inequality...both here and abroad.  By recognizing the privilege he has as a white, cisgender, straight male...without feeling entitled or left out.  By watching the world thru the eyes of a chronically ill survivor, patient and mom as well as adopted fatherhood to a beautiful daughter.

By growing.  By willingness to look past his own experiences.

And he knows medical gender bias exists...he’s seen it first hand.

And I’m so thankful that he believes that we should all be feminists. ♥️

575,"Design on the Road | 5. As artificial intelligence becomes ever more ubiquitous, its design flaws have been revealed, often with dire consequences. An all too common example is the gender bias in the design of many AI systems, which, having been developed primarily by men, often fail to respond to women’s voices, gestures and bodies. (As most of those male designers are white, the same bias often applies to people of colour.) Caroline Criado Perez analyses the impact of gender bias in the design of voice recognition software in cars in her excellent book, Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men. She relates one woman’s complaint that the voice command system in her Ford Focus invariably responded to her husband's voice, but not to her's, even when he was in the passenger seat. Another woman informed Buick about a similar problem with her car's voice-activated phone system  only to be told ""told point-blank that it wasn't ever going to work for me.” Criado Perez observed her mother grappling with the same problem in a Volvo Cross Country. ""After five failed attempts I suggested she tried lowering the pitch of her voice,"" she recalled. ""It worked first time."" #design #techdesign #ai #artificialintelligence #genderbias #carolinecriadoperez #invisiblewomen #designontheroad",genderbias,"|@nguyenc102|😞|This is astounding.|We definitely need women designers - I have yet to find a car with an interior to accommodate women’s basics such as where to put your handbag for starts,...|@knittinginaspen @mx.saga and @lindayowell —do you follow this person?

Not a girls bracelet or a boys bracelet but just a bracelet that made us all feel happy.

580,"Several years back, I was hurt and aghast by what a female high-position administrator told a male physician who was clearly harassing me. ⁣
⁣
It had been going on for months. I wasn’t the only one, but I was the most vocal against him, so he went harder against me. When I finally had enough, I was ready to take it to human resources. This admin told him to back off and keep his head low because she would hate for him to get in trouble and ruin his career over my potential report. There was no reprimand, no remediation, no disciplinary action. Even though multiple people were voicing concerns over his behavior towards me and others. He was a bully, unprofessional and an extremely poor role model, but there he was, being victimized. She needed to protect him from evil me. ⁣
⁣
I was so disappointed and disgusted by this female leader. How could she go against her fellow female when it was clear that he was in the wrong? Why would she not protect ME?⁣
⁣
I realized that traditionally we have been taught to be competitive with one another, because there was such a scarcity of jobs at the top. However, studies show that:⁣
⁣
👊🏼 Women who support women are more successful in business.⁣
⁣
👊🏼 The same is not true for men: there was no link found for the success of men in terms of the gender composition of their inner circles.⁣
⁣
👊🏼 Why? Women trying to rise up in leadership face cultural and systemic hurdles that make it harder for them to advance, such as unconscious bias.⁣
⁣
Bottom line ladies? Find your #girlgang , support other women, help them rise, regardless of your position, and others will see that you are a “supportive team player as well as an inspiring leader—and secure enough in yourself to praise others”. ⁣
⁣
In the words of Madeleine Albright, “There is a special place in hell for women who don't help other women."" Don’t go down there, go up, always up.⁣

On the other hand, anyone who is lgbtqia+ has to live with the fear of being judged or beaten up or worse wherever or whenever. This is why pride is so essential because for these people pride is this one month. This one month where they can be themselves because they won’t be alone. [tags bc this is important:

⁣ ⁣
Picture this, a team of 3 men and 1 woman meet with a client to deliver a proposal;⁣
⁣ ⁣
💅🏽The woman is the 2nd most senior person/ highest earner;⁣
⁣ ⁣
💅🏽75% of work on this proposal was completed by said woman;⁣
⁣ ⁣
👎🏽100 % of individual feedback received was about her appearance;⁣
⁣ ⁣
👎🏽0% of feedback related to her performance.⁣
⁣ ⁣
The woman described is me. Swipe through the pics for the full story!. ⁣
⁣ ⁣
Yesterday’s story is an example of the kind of shit that overrides opportunities for us as women to develop and grow. It sucks to have a but or have a decimal point added to every ounce of our excellence and worthy existence. ⁣
⁣ ⁣
I am unabashedly ambitious. Over the course of my career with plenty of trial and error I have made choices that protect, preserve and give me the opportunity to be excellent (for myself). ⁣
⁣ ⁣
I chose to work from home, actually I fought for it. Although not wholly the reason, but one of the main reasons was so I could focus on my work less the office politics and pressure to look the part ALL THE TIME. ⁣
⁣ ⁣
I choose to seek balance and pursue fun because if I manifested the pressure I was under I’d be a shell of a woman. ⁣
⁣ ⁣
To be a champion of others, at the very least an ally! It was disappointing for me that on that panel yesterday there were women. For me in these situations I want to be an ally. I do that by bringing in those non appearance related comments! By standing up for others when they aren’t there to do it themselves…⁣
⁣
⁣
I speak up! When I spoke to the Bossman I asked for more specific feedback, and also highlighted the issues I had;⁣
⁣
⁣
I am literally rooting for everyone! So more and more people like me take up space where they didn’t think they deserve to. To take that space and use it to make room for more to join me. I have never enjoyed making my being a woman, my skin colour and all other non fucking factors a thing - I do not have time! ⁣
⁣
⁣
Thanks for the overwhelming encouragement, sharings and even the objections! Lots of tears, laughs and learning - there is plenty of hope for an equal future!",genderbias,|#Vibrancy #empowerment #female #feminist #genderbias #misogyny #work #empoweringwomen #selflove #corporatefashion #equality|Glad you’re ambitious.

🌈
Happy Pride Month! The human race is extraordinarily diverse in so many ways: gender, ethnicity, race, class, religion, nationality, sexuality, philosophy, lifestyle. The areas in which we differ are endless. Yet at a basic level, we are all the same. We experience highs and lows in life and strive to be happy and fulfilled. Our common pains and joys bring us together, but our diversity makes us unique.
🌈
Throughout history, so many people died or were deprived of basic rights because of a lack of understanding — an understanding that difference in appearance, belief, or way of life does not make one person better than another.
🌈
Today, there are still plenty of apparent examples all around us like in Sudan and other religious wars. Real people, just like you and me, feel alienated, bullied, despised, and mistreated every day. Many of them are being deprived of basic rights or are being killed.
🌈
Prejudice and unfair assumptions are the enemy of everyone. How can we overcome them?
1️⃣Understand another’s perspective –Consider your own life and everything that has shaped your beliefs. Realize that each of us has their own narrative. Not one is the same.
2️⃣Consider your influences – When you find yourself thinking poorly of someone, stop and consider what influences have created your negative views of that individual.
3️⃣Befriend all – If you avoid befriending certain types of people, go out of your way to find friends of all kinds.
4️⃣Empathize – Imagine, understand, and sympathize with another person’s story.
5️⃣Actively accept –Embrace other people with all of the diversity that comes with them. Don’t define a person based upon one stereotype.
6️⃣Show compassion – Perform random acts of kindness for all types of people. It can be a friendly smile or holding a door open.
🌈
Understanding and accepting people from all walks of life is key to a world where all can live freely and without fear. So practice empathy, don’t be quick to judge, and envision life in another’s shoes  before you treat him or her badly.
🌈

586,"Where’s the sun gone! We are all dreaming of it right now, aren’t we? Sometimes it is so difficult to keep young minds occupied indoors for long periods of time especially those who don’t sit still. ‘Boys don’t stop moving. And girls don’t stop talking’  Just saw this on Facebook today and it made me angry and quite disappointed that we are still spouting such gendered nonsense and perpetuating these stereotypes. In the feminist parenting course membership group I’ve been talking about stereotypes, how they are formed and reinforced, the science behind it, and what we can do to address them everyday with conscious active action rather than passive acceptance. I also did a Facebook live on Monday evening talking more about this and how do we define society-imposed stereotypical behaviour vs nature. The course starts again in 3 weeks time and you’re welcome to join anytime. .

588,"This is the first book I’ve actually finished in as long as I can remember. It’s a story that travels through time to unravel the first theories about differences between the sexes and how those theories have influenced society and science ever since. Stereotypes hurt the questions we are asking, how we interpret the data, who we trust to develop new theories, and even how our subjects act in a research study. But at the end of the day, @angeladsaini is hopeful that even though science got us into this mess, science (with hearty participation by female and even non gender binary scientists) can help to get us out. I cannot wait to read her next book on science and race. #inferior",genderbias,|#genderstudies #genderbias #science #stereotypes #womenarentinferior #thehistoryofscience #evolution #aging #thebrain #menopause #immunity #womeninscience #womeninstem #wearethefuture #thefutureisbright|Thanks for sharing.

591,"The New Mexico Corrections Department submitted this in response to the proposed standards: ""A simple cost-benefit analysis shows that when weighed against the twelve million dollar cost of compliance, non-compliance would be much cheaper. To be clear, the Department has every intention of complying with whatever standards are ultimately approved, but the fact remains that compliance with the currently proposed standards would be very expensive.

The Alabama Department of Corrections estimated that implementing these standards would cost the state $58 million dollars, but that the state could cut costs by keeping the definition of ‘prison rape’ limited.

We strongly recommend the use of the statutory definition of ‘rape,’ as directed by PREA. The term ‘sexual abuse’ is much too broad and encompassing of incidences such as verbal harassment which is not the intent of PREA.
