2,2,"Introducing another of the amazing women profiled in “Counting the Hours: Art, Data, and the Untold Stories of Women’s Work.”
.
Renée is a nationally and internationally known sculptor and contemporary artist who has received numerous prestigious awards and whose work is in the collections of America's top museums. Still, even with this level of success in her field, she struggles with keeping up with her paid work plus all the unpaid tasks required to run her business and her life.
. 
If you find this surprising, consider that on average, women visual artists they earn 74¢ for every dollar made by male artists, and black women working in all fields earn on average 65¢ for every dollar made by white men.*
.
In the sculpture about Renée, solid wood boxes represent paid labor hours and wireframes represent unpaid labor hours, as unpaid labor often goes unseen and unrecognized. Open spaces represent hours when Renée was doing anything other than working.

3,3,"🤨A Gender Gap In Ballet, Seriously?⠀
⠀
In an article in @forbes, Kim Elsesser wrote that according to the @dancedataproject, “72% of ballet companies have a male artistic director. Those women who do get the title of artistic director earn only 68 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. Only one woman made it onto DDP’s top ten list of the highest-paid artistic directors.”⠀
⠀
Young girls are estimated to outnumber boys 20-to-1 in ballet classes. At the leadership level, however, is where the gender gap begins. This is similar to the health and beauty industry, another one that femme folks are more socialized to. A shocking number of makeup companies are owned by parent companies who are owned by (you guessed it!) men.⠀
⠀
Although we know dance has no gender, young girls are encouraged to participate in activities like dance. The argument is not that “ballet is for women” - because it’s for everyone. The argument is that the leadership of any trade should match the majority of its employees and that all leaders should be paid equally. #wagegap #payinequality #ladybosarts ⠀

After the genocides in Rwanda, the women who were left banded together and made sure there were strict laws requiring a certain percentages of women in government. The result is near equality. In Iceland, the women went on strike and that led to a lot of changes. We need to find our own method for creating parity in our political systems. To start, we need to have policies that support parents of both genders who have families. Use it, or lose paternal leave, for instance. #equality #wagegap #whyweneedfeminism",wagegap,|There isn't a wage gap though it's literally illegal to pay a man and woman different for the same job in America,27

18,18,"🙂 Currently: applying to jobs I’m drastically unqualified for. 😉
‍
🤯 You’ve probably heard the following statistic: Men apply for a job when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100% of them. The finding comes from a Hewlett Packard internal report, and seems to suggest that the reasons why women generally don't apply because of three reasons:
‍
1- bias in some work environments
2- girls are strongly socialized to follow the rules [and in school are rewarded]
3- certifications and degrees have historically played a different role for women than for men
‍
💣💥 What does this mean?
When it comes to applying for jobs, WOMEN NEED TO DO THE SAME. Not all job applications appear as they seem. After all-- you can train on the skills, but employers care more about fit than what appears on paper.

P.S. I used to DREAD Mondays. Is this you? Do Sunday nights fill you with tension as you think about those Monday morning debrief meetings? Been there, hated that. 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼 One of the BEST things I ever did was to LEAP out of my comfort zone and quit my corporate job to run the startup I founded. That was in 2011 and I’ve never gone back.🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I’ve become very passionate about helping other women snap out of their doldrum life and see their potential to run their own side hustle or full time business. Why? Because I know how life changing it can be when you leave a soul sucking job filled with NO POINT meetings and red tape- to work on things that EXCITE you and that you feel CALLED to do. 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼 Most women STOP after they consider pursuing their passion because they convince themselves they can’t do it for whatever reason(s). That’s FEAR and lack of CONFIDENCE and it’s so common in women. 👉🏼👉🏼 Is that YOU? I see you. I created an online course designed SPECIFICALLY to teach you the behavioral change system I use and teach other successful lady bosses. Once you apply these practices, you’ll never give in to doubt or fear or #impostersyndrome again and you’ll crush your business goals. How does that sound?

Dr. Shikha Jain is a hematology and oncology physician at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL. She is an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology, Oncology and Cell Therapy and the Physician Director of Media Relations for the Rush University Cancer Center.  She is the founder and host of the podcast “The Rush Cast,” founder of several “Women in Medicine” symposia, and is on the leadership team for SoMeDocs.⠀
Dr. Jain has also written for several organizations including Doximity, KevinMD, ASCO Connection, and completed a year as a Doximity writing fellow. Additionally, Dr. Jain has peer-reviewed publications on her research interests,  which include gender equity, career advancement for women, increasing underrepresented minorities in medicine, the impact of social media on medicine, and GI oncology. Her clinical research focus includes precision oncology, immunotherapy, neuroendocrine tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma. ⠀

Look... If hard work lead to riches then coal miners would be the billionaires.

But they're not!

Who is? LAZY people sitting on yachts sipping fine wine and champagne.

They tell you to work hard so they have more people doing their dirty work.

Laziness isn't what makes them bad though.  Laziness is just a thing that's all. It can be used for either good or bad.

But they are both lazy and GREEDY.

Face it, for a fully functional society, there needs to be hard workers to keep things running.

NOT EVERYBODY can be lazy.

Unfortunately the people who have used their laziness  to ""get other people to do all the work for them"" are also very, very greedy.

We need more Lazy #ProcrastiN8rs who want ""just enough"" to get by and offer fair compensation for the work others provide.

We want more sloths in position of power, taking it easy and eating just enough to be happy, not these dragons we have hoarding all the loot.

I'm all for people profiting off their ideas and success. Don't get me wrong. 
But there's a fine line between profit and greed.

There is NO reason a person (and their family) should own so much wealth.

For me, it's more than just teaching women how to secure $15,000, $45,000 and even $90,000 raises, break through their confusion and overwhelm, make huge career shifts, and navigate the office politics so they can get promoted into senior leadership and gain access to game-changing career opportunities.⁣⁣

It's about helping to create fair and equitable processes and inclusive cultures so that all people - particularly Black women - can thrive.⁣ That's why I spend my days working Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Tech and Financial Services organizations.⁣

Thank you @nycwebfest for this honor, this is the first indie series that I’ve released and it has meant a lot to me and to the women involved, and the women who told me the stories that we used in the making of the show. Men continue to tell me they can’t believe the episodes are based on real events, and women continue to be totally unfazed at the sexism we depict in this series. ALL EPISODES OUT NOW at www.stepintomyoffice.show!! Go see what all the fuss is about 💁🏻‍♀️✨",wagegap,"|•

We can't think of a better reason to take our wealth into our own hands through creating black-owned business, putting more black faces at the top of the corporate ladder, and becoming more informed about our finances. .
Every step you make to improve your finances helps to change the narrative about money in black community. .

75,75,"The gender pay gap does exist or at least looks like it does but for different reasons other than discrimination. It’s illegal and has been since the 1968 equal wage act. The idea that women are supposedly payed less is ridiculous. When you compare hourly rates the rate is the exact same. The reason rates look different is because rates are taken from annual basis and compare how much men and women are making. It seems men are making more which doesn’t make sense if they earn the same hourly rate. The only logical way of defining the annual wage gap would be the amount of hours worked and apparently women are statistically more likely to work less. The wage gap looks real but the data is interpreted wrong. 
Put simply the wage gap doesn’t exist

These exquisite Phoenix beauties are from the Bird Totem collection by everyone’s favorite small business, @indigenousintentions. They were designed for a giveaway to bring awareness to the Native Women’s Wage Gap.

Did you know that Native women earn only 58% of what white, non-Hispanic men make for similar or the same work? Did you know that Native women are the second most poorly paid demographic in the US? Did you know that there are many reports and figures that don’t even include Native people in their research and/or findings? Did you know that there are some Native communities in which the #wagegap is even wider than 58%? Did you know that this pay discrepancy for a Native woman over her 40-year, full-time career is nearly $1,000,000? Or that, per year, the difference is enough money to cover her health insurance premiums for nearly 1.5 years or her childcare costs for nearly 3 years?

You do now. 
While the official date of National Native Women’s Equal Pay Day has already passed, we must continue this conversation, spread this awareness and information, and #demandmore every day of the year. Because every day is #NativeWomensEqualPay Day

111,111,"Ok so I just finished reading #thememo it was definitely a must read and an eye opener. As a women of color who has been in Corporate America for over 10 years it was interesting to read about other women of color experiences, that weren’t so pretty. I have had the pleasure of having amazing mentors and sponsors who have helped shape my career with of course the occasional hiccups and unfair mishaps. Nevertheless I’ve been pretty blessed with guidance and mentorship. However, growing up in the inner city and being the first in my family to graduate college. I never really wanted to secure a seat at the table, rather I wanted the whole table. What I am passionate about and what this book discusses unapologetically is inclusion, diversity and the wage gap that women of color face. Ladies, grab this book and begin to have the open dialogue that’s needed to bring this harsh reality to light. Becoming an entrepreneur while working in Corporate American, I see that we are under represented which is alarming because we are highly educated, graduating college at an all time high. No matter your race or sex it’s time to start addressing inclusion and diversifying these space, and no not because we deserve a pity party but because we are working our asses off and deserve an opportunity and a leveled playing field. 🤗

This piece is visualizes the work hours of an amazing woman named America. America is a Hollywood stuntwoman, filmmaker, stunt coordinator, voice over actor, director, and the mom of a toddler. Though her schedule is different every day, and the overlap between work and family life can be grueling, she thrives on the chaos. ""Everything is on fire, but I got it,"" she says.
.
She's also the Co-President & Founder of The Chimaera Project, a nonprofit that 
supports and advocates for female-identifying filmmakers in an industry that 
notoriously under-represents women—consider that in the top 250 grossing films of 2017, only 11% of directors and 4% of cinematographers were women.
.
In the sculpture of her hours, heavy gold and black forms represent America’s paid labor hours and less-weighty silver and black forms represent her unpaid labor hours. Spaces in the sequence represent hours when America was not working, either at her job, her nonprofit, or at home.",wagegap,"|.

I share about ‘female entrepreneurs’ quite often, as I am one and I feel it is important to level the playing field.  It is almost 2020 after all!

You’re hearing more women speak up about pretty much everything these days, my response to all of the fierce women is a resounding ABSO-FRIGGIN-LUTLEY YES YES YES!  No one puts baby in the corner!

Then again, it IS almost 2020 after all.
.
➡️ Women in the workforce are STILL making .79 cents to every $1.00 a man makes.
.
➡️ Women are still receiving on average a 3% annual pay raise.
.
➡️ Women naturally tend to over-give in the workplace as well.
.
➡️ Women tend to take on or be given more work projects, travel, etc.  All at the sacrifice of their family, children, work-life balance or mental well-being.
.
➡️ Is it worth it?  Ummm, I am going to venture to say NO!  But we do what we need to do, right.

All of these reasons above are what led me to open my own business.
.
I felt the need to remove the option of someone firing me, simply because I called them on their shit.
.
OR, a man telling me to forget about my dreams, as I belonged in his kitchen, dressed scantily while maintaining his thought of what my “ideal weight” needed to be. (True story).
.
No one will EVER again have that kind of power over me, as I control MY destiny.

I UNAPOLOGETICALLY choose WHO I want to work with, HOW MUCH I will make and WHAT I do with my time.

It’s not just about freedom, it is about creating the life I want, while making sure my own legacy IS weaved throughout my overall vision.

Women, whether you are a business-owner, in the work-force, student.... isn’t it time we own our WORTH and rise ALL THE WAY UP?

154,154,"This is how it really is the current situation. We women are still getting paid less. When a woman with the same position and same age still earns less than the man with the same position and age. Why is that so? This is no fair, we women are as much worthy as men. Women have never been paid the same or more for the same work it has never been done before. We were always and still are less paid. This wage gap is big problem, this is really dividing us and it shouldn’t. That why so many women feel so insecure it is nothing wrong with them, but our messed up society that doesn’t give us right to be paid the same amount as men. We need to start doing something about it. And if we would do anything about it like say we won’t work it won’t be good for us because then we have no money. See if we even do something about it we are fucked. So what can we do to change this?

161,161,"Someone asked me this week: ""Why do you own your own business(es)?"" I told her this, it is both fun & invigorating and scary & uncertain, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I stay in this entrepreneur lane because it has forever changed me for the better. I am a stronger, wiser, smarter, savvier, more confident version of the woman I was 10 years ago when I toiled away in corporate america, hoping for that annual 5-10% raise. .
Hence- the Wonder Woman pose in this post. I had to do it.
.
Earlier this year, I found myself at a fork in the road. I started a new business and had hustled hard in January and grown fast- to a profitable 6-figure point- poised for bigger growth....BUT.....I wasn't happy. I didn't like the work. I wasn't challenged. I found most of it to be MIND NUMBING. I was extremely confused. I actually considered the advice of a former colleague who suggested to ""go easy street-- go back to corporate america and get a cushy job-- it would be SO MUCH LESS WORK than you do now and you could name your price."" I was tempted. I interviewed with a couple companies. I was rejected by many for being overqualified or because ""they couldn't afford me"". Finally, I KNEW this was not what I was meant to do.
.
I also recognized the truth. Even though my experience and expertise says I should be able to name my price, the glass ceiling in corporate america is SO REAL it's ridiculous. That idea of ""job security"" is false. No one in ANY position is guaranteed a job for any length of time.Over the past 3 years, I've seen 50+ contacts of client companies get laid off. Add to that the STRONG REALITY of the #wagegap where men are paid upwards of 15-20% more than a woman for the same job-- NO THANK YOU.
.
Here's the bottom line. The most successful people - whether in corporate america or in the entrepreneur lane, are the ones with HUSTLE, PASSION, and BELIEF. Add to that: Consistency and a Never Give Up mindset: THAT IS HOW YOU WIN. That said, the entrepreneur lane is the one where YOU can design a work life and life on YOUR terms, and build real wealth while doing what you LOVE. That's MY jam. What about YOU? Dead end job or living your passion? #maketheleap

I caught myself saying sorry in emails and conversations so often that I now consciously check myself, you know, before I literally “wreck my professional self”, so to say...There’s a fine line between wanting to be genuinely nice and humble, and appearing incompetent...
As #workingwomen, we can be so socialized to constantly apologize for taking space that it can be challenging to acknowledge normal mistakes and not give the impression that we’re not on top of things, when we actually are more than competent and qualified...
So here’s to less apologizing and more assertively acknowledging 😉

Loeta is a dentist and a mother of two. While she was earning her dental degree she commuted from Chico to San Francisco—3 hours each way—staying in an apartment in the city during the week. She kept up with everything happening at home via FaceTime, even ""attending"" family dinner night with her Peruvian-American parents and brother and helping her kids with their homework. Saturday morning she'd leave the city at 3:30am, 
returning home on time to make it to the kids' soccer and 4-H events. After Loeta earned her dental degree she returned home to Chico and bought the practice where she began as a dental assistant at age 16.

It’s impossible to “do it all,” of course, but as a woman the cost of not trying is huge. Data from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research shows that over a 15-year period, women who took just one year off work earned a massive 39 percent less than women who did not take time off.

There are plenty of women “with power” who exclude women that  are struggling to grow their business or women Who ask for guidance as first year teachers or lawyers and are ignored by experienced teachers or lawyers that  refuse to share knowledge or give some  positive criticism.  How are they excluded ? Sometimes By making the criteria to join an organization or attend a seminar - out of reach (fees, or placing criteria on the economic value of their business .  If you only want successful women in your organizations - how does that support the majority of women? Do these organizations reach out to “non-white” minority women?

She was awarded an Emmy for her efforts, which is a win for all involved.(pun intended 😃)

Michelle’s acceptance speech was a call to action for us to step up and speak up to get what we need to succeed.

It was also a challenge to business owners, studio heads and corporate bosses to create a culture where women, “succeed because of not despite working conditions,” as it is smart business and good for their bottom line, aside from being the collaborative healthy, respectful way to create nontoxic work environments.

A doctorate doesn’t do Native women much good in terms of pay...” Additionally, “Native women are paid just 58¢ to $1 paid to white, non-Hispanic men.

As I venture into birth work, I think about the dynamic of the value that is placed on work that is more often fulfilled by womxn and the need for that work and the priority level of birth justice or access to health. In Oklahoma, we are second in the Nation for the most uninsured women of childbearing age. All of this correlates to a substandard quality of life for womxn in Oklahoma, for which we sit at an individual national ranking of 43 for Economic and Social Well-Being. #DemandMore

24 months of rent
20 years of birth control
18 months of health insurance premiums
170 weeks of food”

Though there are hundreds of research studies proving women’s inclusion in the workforce is beneficial to the global economy, if we do not address the roots of gender violence this future will not be possible.⁣
⁣
Why? Because it is gender discrimination and violence against women affecting women regardless of age, country, income or social status.⁣
⁣
According to UN Women’s 2018 statistics,⁣ 👉Over 2.7 billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men.⁣
👉In 18 economies, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working.⁣
👉Globally, women are paid less than men, an estimated wage gap of 23 %. ⁣
👉Globally, nearly 40 % of women in wage employment do not have access to social protection.⁣
⁣
Ever heard the phrase “it’s the economy stupid”? Well, that applies to a male-centric view of the workforce. For women, glass ceilings, cliffs, harassments and labour market restrictions are due to another root cause: “it’s the violence stupid”.⁣

In honor of this day and in partnership with @wogrammer, we'd like to highlight one of our AAUW Selected Professions Fellowship alumnae, Kristina Halona. Kristina is a Native woman herself and is on the board of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (@aises_hq), whose mission is to increase the number of indigenous people and Native Americans studying in STEM. Careers in STEM fields are some of the highest paid jobs and encouraging women to enter these male-dominated fields can help fight the gender pay gap.

“No matter where you are born, your life will be harder if you are born a girl.” — The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 2019 report on global inequality. This is true in every aspect of life, especially when it comes to finances. Women and girls face a lot of financial hurdles, and one way to combat these hurdles is to improve the financial literacy of women. In this article, we are going to discuss what women are up against (the statistics might shock you), explain what the financial literacy gap is, and talk about some things we can do about it. Hopefully we can all do our small part to try to even the financial playing field. .

243,243,"#PayWomenEqually⁠⠀
It's no surprise that a gender pay gap exists across the spectrum. According to Payscale, an online salary survey, women make 79 cents for ever dollar men make-and yes, that is in 2019.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
According to the American Association of University Women (AAUW):⁠⠀
-Mothers, including those who never left the work force, get paid less than other women⁠⠀
-When a man transitions to a female, a pay drop occurs. The same is not true when a female transitions to a male.⁠⠀
-The pay gap widens as women get older.⁠⠀
-Latina and Black women earn 53% and 61% of what white men earn.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I completed residency training in Ob/Gyn. While 82% of doctors matching into Ob/Gyn residency programs are female, men still out-earn women (Gilbert SB, et al. Fertil Steril 2019). ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
In my own subspecialty, in which 57% of all physicians are female, according to the American Urogynecologic Society's salary survey, the mean salary for females is  80% that of males. Male urogynecologists out-earn females right out of training, and this persists amongst physicians 5, 10 and 15 plus years out of training.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
No doubt, the cause is multi-factorial. And of course, if I opt to work less than my male counterparts then I expect to earn less. But it has been shown both in medicine and outside of medicine that this alone does not entirely account for the male-female pay gap.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Because multiple factors play a role in this pay gap, there is not one simple solution. But, at the minimum, we need to acknowledge that there is an issue that requires systemic changes. And ladies, we can't sit back and watch this. We can't be afraid to demand equality because we fear that we will be perceived as ""difficult"" or ""bitchy"". Nothing will change unless we stand up for what we believe in, negotiate harder, and fight for equal pay.💪⁠⠀

📣American Indian and Alaska Native women are paid just 57 cents for every dollar white men are paid. For Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander women, that number is 59 cents. 📣⠀
⠀
We are huge advocates for equal pay, especially in the arts. The wage gap is still very much a real thing that we must fight for every day. That’s why we are dedicated to closing opportunity and pay gaps of artists from all backgrounds.⠀

On a more important note, I’ve dropped some 2019 American Bar Association statistics about women in the legal profession in this post to highlight the stark inequalities still seen in one of the most educated professions. 60% of the US population is women yet they only make up 35% of the field, and they only earn 75-80% of what men earn in the same profession. Keep in mind that these gaps are even more serious for women of color. .

We have made huge strides in the last few decades, but as current politics have made clear, there is still so far to go. Keep supporting and encouraging the women around you, and fight for your place in the spaces where decisions are made. We need you. .

266,266,"This according to an analysis of 2019 AAPA Salary Survey data  This includes PAs who are compensated a base salary, an hourly wage, or some form of productivity pay. This discrepancy is found even after controlling for factors such as hours worked, major specialty area, experience, and other career variables.⠀
⠀
It's crazy to see that even in a profession that is nearly 70% female, we still see a gender wage gap. ⠀
⠀
Want to know something even more peculiar? In a survey of PA students, female students anticipated a lower starting salary than male students. Do you think this mindset affected salary negotiations and starting salaries for female PAs compared to males? 🤔⠀
⠀
Ladies, we make up 70% of the profession... This is unacceptable! ⠀
⠀
The good news: AAPA seems to be very focused on this issue. According to its website, ""AAPA is working to solve the PA pay gap by making sure that every PA has the tools they need to effectively negotiate their pay and benefits. "" ⠀
⠀
Check out AAPAs website for more information on how they're addressing this issue. Ladies, we've worked too hard to get here to settle for less than we deserve. Gentlemen, you surely realize this isn't about you making too much, rather your female colleagues making too little, which isn't good for any of us. This issue should matter to you, too⠀

His profession is in business/finance but I know he is getting paid exceedingly higher than his female coworkers. What is interesting is his director is a female. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I do think that society’s view about male vs. female play a huge role in this discrimination. However, my husband in the workforce is very bold. Also, One thing I noticed about my husband is that he will not accept or even request a lower pay. Meaning, during the interview process, he would only apply to positions that had a higher pay and would only request a certain pay. I think this issue starts in the beginning, prior to working. Also, he is very confident in his skill set. He spoke and acted in his abilities. I believe it’s very clear that he will not stay for less and it’s very true. During an interview for a promotion, he also stated very boldly how many would quit with the vigor and demands that the company has. Everyone was quiet at first but then quickly agreed.  I was employed at a medical school. I was offered a salary that I felt was exceedingly lower than what I should get paid. I said no. It was clear If that way the pay I will not be working there and they doubled the salary . However , a man applying to the exact same position may have been offered initially the higher salary opposed to having to negotiate, which is still a problem. Different field but that problem persist in most career fields. I’m glad the AAPA is looking into this!|women need to step up and negotiate more. demand more. Stand up for ourselves.

The numbers vary considerably by type of disability and when factoring in gender, race, and age.

They want us to work instead of being on benefits but try to find a non-minimum-wage job willing to take a disabled person on.

⁣⁣⠀
My ultimate money goal at that time was just to make $100,000 a year. I thought it would take my entire career to get there. I didn’t even know it was possible for me to make $125,000 or $150,000. Let alone $175,000 and then $200,000+!!!⁣⁣⠀

Loeta is a dentist and a mother of two. While she was earning her dental degree she commuted from Chico to San Francisco—3 hours each way—staying in an apartment in the city during the week. She kept up with everything happening at home via FaceTime, even ""attending"" family dinner night with her Peruvian-American parents and brother and helping her kids with their homework. Saturday morning she'd leave the city at 3:30am, 
returning home on time to make it to the kids' soccer and 4-H events. After Loeta earned her dental degree she returned home to Chico and bought the practice where she began as a dental assistant at age 16.

It’s impossible to “do it all,” of course, but as a woman the cost of not trying is huge. Data from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research shows that over a 15-year period, women who took just one year off work earned a massive 39 percent less than women who did not take time off.

In the sculpture of her hours, Loeta’s paid work hours are represented by gold-leafed pieces and her unpaid work hours by silver-leafed pieces. Hours when Loeta was doing anything other than work are represented by empty spaces.",wagegap,"|.

This is why it looks the way it does.

There are plenty of women “with power” who exclude women that  are struggling to grow their business or women Who ask for guidance as first year teachers or lawyers and are ignored by experienced teachers or lawyers that  refuse to share knowledge or give some  positive criticism.  How are they excluded ? Sometimes By making the criteria to join an organization or attend a seminar - out of reach (fees, or placing criteria on the economic value of their business .  If you only want successful women in your organizations - how does that support the majority of women? Do these organizations reach out to “non-white” minority women?

She brought attention to the gender wage gap (and specifically to how it disproportionately impacts women of color) and also shared how she asserted herself on set & asked for what she needed to succeed.

To play Gwen Verdon in FX’s “Fosse/Verdon” she made specific requests for additional dance lessons, voice lessons, a new wig, and fake teeth not made of rubber. .

She was awarded an Emmy for her efforts, which is a win for all involved.(pun intended 😃)
.
.
Michelle’s acceptance speech was a call to action for us to step up and speak up to get what we need to succeed.

It was also a challenge to business owners, studio heads and corporate bosses to create a culture where women, “succeed because of not despite working conditions,” as it is smart business and good for their bottom line, aside from being the collaborative healthy, respectful way to create nontoxic work environments.

327,28,"Today is Native Women’s Equal Pay Day! Last year I was part of a collective campaign by @urbannativeera & ‪@phenomenal to raise awareness about the severe pay disparity that Native women face. This is despite achieving higher education: ++++
“Native women experience pay disparities at every level of education, and it actually worsens the more education a Native woman achieves. A doctorate doesn’t do Native women much good in terms of pay...” Additionally, “Native women are paid just 58¢ to $1 paid to white, non-Hispanic men. That’s a #wagegap that represents money Native women could be spending on nearly 32 more months of child care or more than 17 months of health insurance premiums.” (via @nativewomenlead).
++++
As I venture into birth work, I think about the dynamic of the value that is placed on work that is more often fulfilled by womxn and the need for that work and the priority level of birth justice or access to health. In Oklahoma, we are second in the Nation for the most uninsured women of childbearing age. All of this correlates to a substandard quality of life for womxn in Oklahoma, for which we sit at an individual national ranking of 43 for Economic and Social Well-Being. #DemandMore

“...Native women have to work almost 22 months to earn as much what a white man makes in 12. The wage gap cannot be explained away by choices and is especially harmful to women of color. Closing the wage gap is integral to improving health, well-being, and economic security of all women and families.
If the wage go closed Native women would have:
24 months of rent
20 years of birth control
18 months of health insurance premiums
170 weeks of food”

⁣
Though there are hundreds of research studies proving women’s inclusion in the workforce is beneficial to the global economy, if we do not address the roots of gender violence this future will not be possible.⁣
⁣
Why? Because it is gender discrimination and violence against women affecting women regardless of age, country, income or social status.⁣
⁣
According to UN Women’s 2018 statistics,⁣ 👉Over 2.7 billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men.⁣
👉In 18 economies, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working.⁣
👉Globally, women are paid less than men, an estimated wage gap of 23 %. ⁣
👉Globally, nearly 40 % of women in wage employment do not have access to social protection.⁣
⁣
Ever heard the phrase “it’s the economy stupid”? Well, that applies to a male-centric view of the workforce. For women, glass ceilings, cliffs, harassments and labour market restrictions are due to another root cause: “it’s the violence stupid”.⁣

Kristina is a Native woman herself and is on the board of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (@aises_hq), whose mission is to increase the number of indigenous people and Native Americans studying in STEM. Careers in STEM fields are some of the highest paid jobs and encouraging women to enter these male-dominated fields can help fight the gender pay gap.

334,35,"""When you put value in to a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value.“⁣⁠

In her acceptance speech, actress Michelle Williams addressed the gender pay gap in Hollywood and the disparity between women of color and their white male counterparts. ⁣⁠
⁣⁠
In January 2018, Williams talked about the pay inequality she experienced with her co-star, Mark Wahlberg, on a film where he received a $1.5 million bonus. ⁣⁠

Today they posted a powerful blog for #NativeWomensEqualPayDay, which marks the day to which Native women must work to match what non-Hispanic white men earned the previous year. In Colorado, Native women make just 56% of what their white male counterparts make.

“No matter where you are born, your life will be harder if you are born a girl.” — The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 2019 report on global inequality. This is true in every aspect of life, especially when it comes to finances. Women and girls face a lot of financial hurdles, and one way to combat these hurdles is to improve the financial literacy of women. In this article, we are going to discuss what women are up against (the statistics might shock you), explain what the financial literacy gap is, and talk about some things we can do about it. Hopefully we can all do our small part to try to even the financial playing field. .

354,55,"#PayWomenEqually⁠⠀
It's no surprise that a gender pay gap exists across the spectrum. According to Payscale, an online salary survey, women make 79 cents for ever dollar men make-and yes, that is in 2019.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
According to the American Association of University Women (AAUW):⁠⠀
-Mothers, including those who never left the work force, get paid less than other women⁠⠀
-When a man transitions to a female, a pay drop occurs. The same is not true when a female transitions to a male.⁠⠀
-The pay gap widens as women get older.⁠⠀
-Latina and Black women earn 53% and 61% of what white men earn.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I completed residency training in Ob/Gyn. While 82% of doctors matching into Ob/Gyn residency programs are female, men still out-earn women (Gilbert SB, et al. Fertil Steril 2019). ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
In my own subspecialty, in which 57% of all physicians are female, according to the American Urogynecologic Society's salary survey, the mean salary for females is  80% that of males. Male urogynecologists out-earn females right out of training, and this persists amongst physicians 5, 10 and 15 plus years out of training.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
No doubt, the cause is multi-factorial. And of course, if I opt to work less than my male counterparts then I expect to earn less. But it has been shown both in medicine and outside of medicine that this alone does not entirely account for the male-female pay gap.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Because multiple factors play a role in this pay gap, there is not one simple solution. But, at the minimum, we need to acknowledge that there is an issue that requires systemic changes. And ladies, we can't sit back and watch this. We can't be afraid to demand equality because we fear that we will be perceived as ""difficult"" or ""bitchy"". Nothing will change unless we stand up for what we believe in, negotiate harder, and fight for equal pay.💪⁠⠀

355,56,"You are probably familiar with “equal pay day” that comes up in the spring. It signifies how far into the year women must work in order to earn what men earned in the previous year. This year, it was April 2.⠀

Well, that date is ARBITRARY. It doesn’t exactly factor in women of color. Did you know that… ⠀
⠀
🎤Asian-American women make $.85 for every dollar, and their equal pay day is March 5, 2019;⠀
🎤African American and/or Black women earn $.61 for every dollar, and their equal pay day is August 22, 2019;⠀
🎤Native Women earn $.58 for every dollar, and their equal pay day is TODAY - September 23, 2019;⠀
🎤Latinas earn $.53 for every dollar, and their equal pay day is November 20, 2019.⠀
⠀
Let’s take today, let’s learn some facts and use them to move towards justice. ⠀
⠀
📣American Indian and Alaska Native women are paid just 57 cents for every dollar white men are paid. For Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander women, that number is 59 cents. 📣⠀

We are huge advocates for equal pay, especially in the arts. The wage gap is still very much a real thing that we must fight for every day. That’s why we are dedicated to closing opportunity and pay gaps of artists from all backgrounds.⠀

On a more important note, I’ve dropped some 2019 American Bar Association statistics about women in the legal profession in this post to highlight the stark inequalities still seen in one of the most educated professions. 60% of the US population is women yet they only make up 35% of the field, and they only earn 75-80% of what men earn in the same profession. Keep in mind that these gaps are even more serious for women of color. .

We have made huge strides in the last few decades, but as current politics have made clear, there is still so far to go. Keep supporting and encouraging the women around you, and fight for your place in the spaces where decisions are made. We need you. .

377,78,"This according to an analysis of 2019 AAPA Salary Survey data  This includes PAs who are compensated a base salary, an hourly wage, or some form of productivity pay. This discrepancy is found even after controlling for factors such as hours worked, major specialty area, experience, and other career variables.⠀
⠀
It's crazy to see that even in a profession that is nearly 70% female, we still see a gender wage gap. ⠀
⠀
Want to know something even more peculiar? In a survey of PA students, female students anticipated a lower starting salary than male students. Do you think this mindset affected salary negotiations and starting salaries for female PAs compared to males? 🤔⠀
⠀
Ladies, we make up 70% of the profession... This is unacceptable! ⠀
⠀
The good news: AAPA seems to be very focused on this issue. According to its website, ""AAPA is working to solve the PA pay gap by making sure that every PA has the tools they need to effectively negotiate their pay and benefits. "" ⠀
⠀
Check out AAPAs website for more information on how they're addressing this issue. Ladies, we've worked too hard to get here to settle for less than we deserve. Gentlemen, you surely realize this isn't about you making too much, rather your female colleagues making too little, which isn't good for any of us. This issue should matter to you, too⠀

We can have the desire to “not make waves” or the perceived notion to avoid confrontation. I think it’s fantastic the AAPA recognizes the discrepancy and offers tools to help.|The discrepancy in pay is larger than just assuming an employer is paying less because someone is female. For private employers they feel woman will settle for their first offer and many times this is true. You have to be willing to walk away to get paid what you are worth.

They take the first offer.|🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄|Interesting post! I definitely believe. My husband is in a completely different field. His profession is in business/finance but I know he is getting paid exceedingly higher than his female coworkers. What is interesting is his director is a female. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I do think that society’s view about male vs. female play a huge role in this discrimination. However, my husband in the workforce is very bold. Also, One thing I noticed about my husband is that he will not accept or even request a lower pay. Meaning, during the interview process, he would only apply to positions that had a higher pay and would only request a certain pay. I think this issue starts in the beginning, prior to working. Also, he is very confident in his skill set. He spoke and acted in his abilities. I believe it’s very clear that he will not stay for less and it’s very true. During an interview for a promotion, he also stated very boldly how many would quit with the vigor and demands that the company has. Everyone was quiet at first but then quickly agreed.  I was employed at a medical school. I was offered a salary that I felt was exceedingly lower than what I should get paid. I said no. It was clear If that way the pay I will not be working there and they doubled the salary . However , a man applying to the exact same position may have been offered initially the higher salary opposed to having to negotiate, which is still a problem. Different field but that problem persist in most career fields. I’m glad the AAPA is looking into this!|women need to step up and negotiate more. demand more. Stand up for ourselves.

The numbers vary considerably by type of disability and when factoring in gender, race, and age. But it’s important to remember that disability justice should be part of *every* discussion on wage and pay gaps. #disability #disabilityawareness #disabilityjustice #equality #equalpay #wagegap",wagegap,"|I'm not surprised at all. They want us to work instead of being on benefits but try to find a non-minimum-wage job willing to take a disabled person on. They're few and far between, especially if you don't have an education beyond secondary school. 😒 I work 3 days a week for a few pence above the ""living wage"" because it's all I can handle with my disability and because I can't do more hours, basically all avenues for advancement are closed to me. (Those who think education is the answer: brain fog + chronic pain + extreme fatigue + no disposable income make that a more complex issue than it first seems, not just for me, but for many).|I feel this so much",104

Back then, $50k was a lot of money to me and I was just so grateful to not be a broke college student anymore eating Ramen for dinner and having to beg my dad for money so I could go to Daytona Beach for Spring Break (even though I'm sure I lied to him about what I needed the money for 🤦🏽‍♀️ )⁣⁣⠀
⁣⁣⠀
My ultimate money goal at that time was just to make $100,000 a year. I thought it would take my entire career to get there. I didn’t even know it was possible for me to make $125,000 or $150,000. Let alone $175,000 and then $200,000+!!!⁣⁣⠀

How is this possible?!⁣⁣⠀

What I realized pretty early on in my career is that being seen as a go-to expert was worth a lot of cash.⁣⁣⠀
⁣⁣⠀
The thing is though, most Black women aren't allowing themselves to be SEEN as the experts they are.⁣⁣⠀
⁣⁣⠀
And in order to increase your income, impact and influence it's not enough for you to know your value, other people have to see it as well.⁣⁣⠀

Women are constantly trying to prove themselves, both in the workplace and at home; often feeling that they have to choose between having/growing/managing a family and progressing their career. ⠀

I know I'm not the only one who can relate to feeling like you need to accomplish this or that by the time you're X years old.⁣⁣⠀

Wouldn't it just cause more harm? Idk|Tbh I love the concept of more women in power cuz by logic that (normally) means that women can finally have a say in their rights but the countries shown in the first post are not good examples at all. Like in Sri Lanka they have this practice to shame girls and women who are in their period by forcing them to aisle themselves in a small hut outside their village, and they are treated as if they have done something wrong (it has a name, but I don’t remember it). As for Bangladesh and the others, literally the women there barely have rights (except for the most upper clases obv) and their wage gap is immense. Like yeah having women in power allows us to have a voice in political and economic matters, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it will benefit women as a whole. Like having political representation is not the issue. What we have to aim for is having diverse political representation as women are not a homogenous group and everyone has different ideas...so yeah. PD: also it’s sad that in 2019 we still have celebrate this...like humanity when to the moon and back and half of the population still doesn’t have rights lmao|Doesn't this prove that women in America are just dumb and not really oppressed",1299

Our clients ask a lot of questions about overtime. Despite many workplaces that are trying hard to keep work hours reasonable and limit them to 40 hours per week, in busy workplaces, overtime is very often inevitable – at least once in awhile. .
There is a lot to know about overtime, more than we can cover in this post, but here are some highlights and practical tips. .

I will agree with something you said, my wife stayed home with our kids until they were in school and day and then worked part time.

497,198,"“2018 looks like a great year for the women’s pay gap, according to census data released today: A woman now makes 82 cents on average to the man’s dollar, a seemingly significant jump from last year, when she made 80.5 cents to his dollar. But that number is misleading,” writes Lily staff writer Caroline Kitchener. ""There was no actual change in the data."" The difference stems instead from a survey methodology change. The problem, experts say, is that the new numbers will likely make people think the wage gap is shrinking. And that assumption is dangerous. Head to the link in our bio for the full story.

This doesn’t take in that men work more hours, work more dangerous jobs, live shorter lives then women. Once you factor these things the gap shrinks tremendously. Also, the studies that say that women get paid less then men for having the exact same job, are wrong. The studies that been done ignore a lot of criteria, like experience.

498,199,"PSA: The reason why women aren’t as prominent in pro gaming may have something to do with an endless amount of harassment and discrimination. 
Laziness, or lack of talent may not be such likely factors here. I’m sure anyone can imagine how exhausting it is to go into an environment that you know isn’t going to accept you. 
There is definitely a certain amount of pressure for us to do particularly well when we join a lobby. “Oh it’s a girl, bet she’s trash” or we get heat for not being in the kitchen... a timeless classic. If we do well we also hear about how we should “EAD” etc. 
The comments on these articles are soooooo painful. Gaming is my single passion. I’m obsessed. I love the community and am working to be a part of it. But holy fuck this is a tall order. 
No one understands except us. No one cares accept us. This is a tough crowd, ladies.

⁠
There are so many studies showing how women make/have less money than men. ⁠
⁠
One says that twice as many women as men have less than $400 in total savings while twice as many men as women have $50,000 or more in total savings. ⁠
⁠
Well when women are making less, of course, we will have less in savings! ⁠
⁠
I'm sure the statistics are worse for women of color and worse for men of color than white men. ⁠

I believe in a world where there is enough abundance for everyone. Let's build that world together, are you in?⁠

513,214,"I had a truly humbling experience last week that rocked my confidence and almost had me forget just how far I've come in my career.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Before I was a Diversity & Inclusion strategist for Google...⁣⁣⁣⁣
Before my LinkedIn profile exploded and attracted recruiters from top companies like Bloomberg, Facebook and LinkedIn...⁣⁣⁣⁣
Before my ideas were featured in Black Enterprise and Forbes...⁣⁣⁣⁣
Before I was a master career coach with clients that get $90k raises...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
I was building a career that was slowly dimming my light.⁣⁣⁣
I felt lonely and isolated because I was always the only person that looked like me in the room.⁣⁣⁣
Any success I got never felt like it belonged to me - it felt like it came from having to play the game and be someone I wasn't.⁣⁣⁣
I didn't ask for raises because I was afraid they'd tell me no.⁣⁣⁣
I worked 12 hour days trying to ""prove myself"".⁣
I was afraid to ask for help.⁣⁣⁣
I did everything on my own.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
But then one day, something changed.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I became more confident. I started demanding the kind of pay that reflected what my work was worth. My network grew. My work was sought after and valued. And before I knew it, I'd become an industry leader and expert at work (and got paid like one).⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
And honestly, it wasn’t about working harder or smarter. It was about realizing that the game was rigged and that I had to stop trying to play by their rules.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Most Black women aren’t struggling to excel in their Tech careers because of poor work ethic or lack of skill. They’re struggling because they’re approaching their career the WRONG way.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
It's time to play the game by YOUR rules, not theirs.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
On Thursday, September 18, during my free training on How To Dominate Your Tech Job Search, I’m going to show you:⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
➡️ HOW TO GET CRYSTAL CLEAR ON YOUR NEXT CAREER MOVE IN TECH⁣⁣⁣
➡️ HOW TO GET CHASED BY YOUR DREAM TECH COMPANIES⁣⁣⁣
➡️ HOW TO GET KNOWN AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT IN TECH⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
All without sacrificing your authenticity or losing yourself in the process.⁣⁣⁣

515,216,"You’ve got that right!

Equal pay is so damn important. 
We do the same job as men, we should be paid the same as men.

We should all be paid the same as are co-workers of other races as well - we can’t forget this! 
A fight for women’s equality is also a fight for the equality of all minorities. We’re in this together and we need to hold the door open for each other!

This is happening in every field of work but it’s the most obvious in sports.

Take the US women’s soccer team as an example. They’re killing the game, they’re doing better than the men, and yet they still make MUCH less than the men’s team.

I’m hopeful that their amazing record will show women’s sports teams around the world the benefits of investing in women, but there’s still SO much work to be done!

Some of you might be in school still and might not care, but you absolutely should because although it may not affect you now you’re generation is about to be hired and you will soon be dealing with it if we can’t fix this.

This has gone on for far too long!

Just remember we will get their together. This is a fight we cannot win alone, babes🖤

why is there a distinct difference in the wages of men, women and the LGBTQ+ community? 
Getting a job, has nothing to do with your gender. 
It’s because of the skill one has. 
Developing a skill is absolutely upon one’s self. 
Why can’t a women be given the same pay as a man? 
Just because she isn’t capable enough? 
Why isnt she capable? 
because she isnt as physically strong as a man? 
a woman not being physically strong as a man, is a myth. 
Yes, women are entitled to maternity leaves. But that’s natural!? Its not her fault. 
dear society, stop making up excuses. 
We demand equal pay. 
why can’t the LGBTQ+ community also be given same opportunities? 
Yes, they’re different. 
but just because they dont love the same gender like us, doesnt mean they shouldn’t be a job. 
Job’s should be given because of one’s merit. 
Not because of their sexual orientation. 
Their personal choices have nothing to do with their skill of perfectly executing their job. 
Dear society, we demands equal pay.

534,235,"Delhi recorded a high population growth of 8% between 2000 and 2011. Among the reasons were increased rate of migration of people from neighbouring states as well as other parts of the country.

However, its women Workforce Participation Rate has always remained below the national average and has further recorded a significant decline of 10% between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

A disaggregated division of Workforce Participation Rate (WPR) in the state, across consumption classes portrays a disturbing picture. Within the state, the lowest WPR is recorded amongst women of the low consumption class while the women of the high consumption class recorded the highest WPR in both the periods, 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Also, over time, women of the poorer households witnessed the larger decline in WPR when compared to women of rich households. This could possibly be explained by the fact that most jobs in Delhi are in the service sector and the chances of securing these jobs are higher for the educated high consumption class rather than women from the poorer sections. 
In addition to this, the average monthly consumption expenditure in the state has also declined significantly (15%) among the poor households whereas the rich experienced an increase in consumption expenditure. So, the poor households experienced a decline in consumption spending while experiencing a fall in women WPR. This indicates both their economic as well as financial hardships. 
In India, nearly 9.2 million women were engaged as domestic workers in 2017-18 and in Delhi, the approximate figure was more than two lakh in the same year. Similarly, in health and social work, women were largely involved as ASHA and Anganwadi workers and were not on direct payroll. Because of this, most of their services were considered “voluntary work,” though they often performed roles which was beyond their contracts.

If you didn’t know, women take up the majority of the top 5 lowest paying fields, and men make up the majority of 4 of the top 5 highest paying fields.

I asked for (and successfully received) my first raise at age 16. I don’t know where I learned this - but I knew I was contributing more and decided to ask‼️ It's easy to leave money on the table. Why? For most of us, even the thought of negotiating for a better pay and circumstances makes us nervous. 😖We tell ourselves “I’d be greedy to ask.” or “They won’t like me.” We may not know where to start or what words to use. So we take what is offered.

Here’s the thing: asking for more money, benefits, and a better work situation is a skill you CAN learn and start practicing right now. ⏱Hey, you may even be doing this without realizing it! 
I’m going to teach you how. We'll get you to a place where you're feeling confident and ready to avoid the traps that many of us fall into.

In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don’t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn’t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week.
Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is “choice.” The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap “may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.” Well, let’s look at some of those choices.",21

They talk about women aren't getting paid their value but COMPLETELY MISS that a number of women don't know their value. 
They say women aren't promoted but COMPLETELY MISS women are asking to be promoted and/or aren't asking the right way.

They say women aren't getting to the C-Suite but COMPLETELY MISS that women aren't aware of the game or don't want to play the political games it takes to get there. 
Don't get twisted ladies. 
Either you're playing the game or you're being played. 
Point, blank, period.

It's time to get off the sidelines and learn how to play the game like a B-O-S-S.

578,279,"#TuesdayThoughts answering one of my most FAQs, “I know I should negotiate my salary, but I’m scared. What if the company rescinds my offer?” 🤔
My answer: Well...yeah, they might. It happened to me. A few years ago I applied for a role at an EdTech company. The position was too junior for me and the pay was very low, but I figured I could move up the ranks quickly. When the recruiter called to make an offer, I submitted a counter and they said they would get back to me. They did, and there was no change. So I countered again, this time asking for 2 work from home days a week. When the recruiter called me this time she said, “We’ve discussed your ask with the director and it seems like this role would not be a good fit for you at this time.” 🤯 I panicked and said “Wait...no, I think we can work this out”. She cringed, said “I’m sorry” and awkwardly hung up the phone 😬 I started crying, I really screwed up. HERE COMES THE MORAL OF THE STORY- This experience helped me realize how valuable my experience was, and that I was no longer willing to be underpaid for it. That was the last job I applied for before founding Chloe Taylor Technology. I wanted to do the work I was passionate about and get paid fairly for it. Remember, “Man’s rejection is God’s protection.” I KNEW I would have been miserable in that role, and not getting it helped shape my whole future. If the company says no, it’s not necessarily a bad thing, it may have saved you from a future you didn’t want anyway.",wagegap,|#femalefounders  #stem #girlswhocode  #tech #inspo #education  #entrepreneur  #femalefounders  #motivation #business #womeninbusiness #wagegap #blackwomensequalpayday #negotiation #startup #money #salary #ladiesgetpaid #womeninstem #motivationmonday|Inspiring forreal!|WHEWWWW THISSSSSS 😩🙌🏾|👏🏾👏🏾 This!!!|I feel like you two need to virtually meet @chloetaylortech and @pauleannareid over this post! ❤️|👏🏽💖|I don’t know who needs to hear this but...

594,295,"Back in March after the mass shooting in mosques happened in New Zealand, New Zealand’s prime minister vowed to ban guns within 24 hours. Yet here we are, after 2,128 mass shootings since 2013 in the United States, with no change when it comes to gun control. JUST THE PAST 6 YEARS. That’s roughly 1 shooting per day. 
There were about 10,000 deaths alone in 2019 from gun violence (about 20,000 injuries). WE DON’T HAVE ANY TIME LEFT. This is how serious it is. It could be anyone at any given moment. We need leaders in powerful positions that will sacrifice their own self interest (corporate interests, reputation preservation) to actually work for the people. We need legislation for gun control. Drastic changes in our current firearm access laws. The constitution was designed to adapt to our current progress as a society, not stay stagnant in its place from the 18th century. And gun reform is now a necessity, not a choice for the survival of the constitution and preserving the rights and lives of Americans.

(3rd slide, 2nd point). That's all the late term abortions|The second slide gave my heart a big uwu 🥺🥰🥰😭|While I agree with this, we need to address the fact that sometimes people do get late term abortions because they want to. An example is the now queen of Spain, who aborted when she was 6 months pregnant, only because if she had the baby she couldn’t marry the prince or be part of the royal family (she was pregnant from another guy). As well as many underage and young girls who, bc of many reasons, cannot abort until late term pregnancy (whether it’s because they didn’t tell or bc they are kept waiting in the abortion clinic process, etc). We should also address the fact that technically, beyond seven months, it can be considered a baby, or at least, an alive being (since actually seven-month-old fetuses can survive outside the womb and be born, apart from having all their inner systems and organs developed, except the size, and they do show signs of reaction like hiccups, kicks, etc). So in conclusion, abortion is a rough subject that cannot be treated lightly, and I believe we cannot generalise all abortion cases. (Im pro-choice, and while I totally understand if a woman has to abort bc of dangerous medical reasons, late term abortions can be...sketchy at best)",2126
598,0,"PSA: The reason why women aren’t as prominent in pro gaming may have something to do with an endless amount of harassment and discrimination. 
Laziness, or lack of talent may not be such likely factors here. I’m sure anyone can imagine how exhausting it is to go into an environment that you know isn’t going to accept you. 
There is definitely a certain amount of pressure for us to do particularly well when we join a lobby. “Oh it’s a girl, bet she’s trash” or we get heat for not being in the kitchen... a timeless classic. If we do well we also hear about how we should “EAD” etc. 
The comments on these articles are soooooo painful. Gaming is my single passion. I’m obsessed. I love the community and am working to be a part of it. But holy fuck this is a tall order. 
No one understands except us. No one cares accept us. This is a tough crowd, ladies.

⁠
There are so many studies showing how women make/have less money than men. ⁠
⁠
One says that twice as many women as men have less than $400 in total savings while twice as many men as women have $50,000 or more in total savings. ⁠
⁠
Well when women are making less, of course, we will have less in savings! ⁠
⁠
I'm sure the statistics are worse for women of color and worse for men of color than white men. ⁠

I believe in a world where there is enough abundance for everyone. Let's build that world together, are you in?⁠

⁣⁣⁣
Before I was a Diversity & Inclusion strategist for Google...⁣⁣⁣⁣
Before my LinkedIn profile exploded and attracted recruiters from top companies like Bloomberg, Facebook and LinkedIn...⁣⁣⁣⁣
Before my ideas were featured in Black Enterprise and Forbes...⁣⁣⁣⁣
Before I was a master career coach with clients that get $90k raises...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
I was building a career that was slowly dimming my light.⁣⁣⁣
I felt lonely and isolated because I was always the only person that looked like me in the room.⁣⁣⁣
Any success I got never felt like it belonged to me - it felt like it came from having to play the game and be someone I wasn't.⁣⁣⁣
I didn't ask for raises because I was afraid they'd tell me no.⁣⁣⁣
I worked 12 hour days trying to ""prove myself"".⁣
I was afraid to ask for help.⁣⁣⁣
I did everything on my own.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
But then one day, something changed.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I became more confident. I started demanding the kind of pay that reflected what my work was worth. My network grew. My work was sought after and valued. And before I knew it, I'd become an industry leader and expert at work (and got paid like one).⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
And honestly, it wasn’t about working harder or smarter. It was about realizing that the game was rigged and that I had to stop trying to play by their rules.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Most Black women aren’t struggling to excel in their Tech careers because of poor work ethic or lack of skill. They’re struggling because they’re approaching their career the WRONG way.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
It's time to play the game by YOUR rules, not theirs.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
On Thursday, September 18, during my free training on How To Dominate Your Tech Job Search, I’m going to show you:⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
➡️ HOW TO GET CRYSTAL CLEAR ON YOUR NEXT CAREER MOVE IN TECH⁣⁣⁣
➡️ HOW TO GET CHASED BY YOUR DREAM TECH COMPANIES⁣⁣⁣
➡️ HOW TO GET KNOWN AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT IN TECH⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
All without sacrificing your authenticity or losing yourself in the process.⁣⁣⁣

615,17,"You’ve got that right!

Equal pay is so damn important. 
We do the same job as men, we should be paid the same as men.

We should all be paid the same as are co-workers of other races as well - we can’t forget this! 
A fight for women’s equality is also a fight for the equality of all minorities. We’re in this together and we need to hold the door open for each other!

This is happening in every field of work but it’s the most obvious in sports.

Take the US women’s soccer team as an example. They’re killing the game, they’re doing better than the men, and yet they still make MUCH less than the men’s team.

I’m hopeful that their amazing record will show women’s sports teams around the world the benefits of investing in women, but there’s still SO much work to be done!

Some of you might be in school still and might not care, but you absolutely should because although it may not affect you now you’re generation is about to be hired and you will soon be dealing with it if we can’t fix this.

This has gone on for far too long!

Just remember we will get their together. This is a fight we cannot win alone, babes🖤

why is there a distinct difference in the wages of men, women and the LGBTQ+ community? 
Getting a job, has nothing to do with your gender. 
It’s because of the skill one has. 
Developing a skill is absolutely upon one’s self. 
Why can’t a women be given the same pay as a man? 
Just because she isn’t capable enough? 
Why isnt she capable? 
because she isnt as physically strong as a man? 
a woman not being physically strong as a man, is a myth. 
Yes, women are entitled to maternity leaves. But that’s natural!? Its not her fault. 
dear society, stop making up excuses. 
We demand equal pay. 
why can’t the LGBTQ+ community also be given same opportunities? 
Yes, they’re different. 
but just because they dont love the same gender like us, doesnt mean they shouldn’t be a job. 
Job’s should be given because of one’s merit. 
Not because of their sexual orientation. 
Their personal choices have nothing to do with their skill of perfectly executing their job. 
Dear society, we demands equal pay.

634,36,"Delhi recorded a high population growth of 8% between 2000 and 2011. Among the reasons were increased rate of migration of people from neighbouring states as well as other parts of the country.

However, its women Workforce Participation Rate has always remained below the national average and has further recorded a significant decline of 10% between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

A disaggregated division of Workforce Participation Rate (WPR) in the state, across consumption classes portrays a disturbing picture. Within the state, the lowest WPR is recorded amongst women of the low consumption class while the women of the high consumption class recorded the highest WPR in both the periods, 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Also, over time, women of the poorer households witnessed the larger decline in WPR when compared to women of rich households. This could possibly be explained by the fact that most jobs in Delhi are in the service sector and the chances of securing these jobs are higher for the educated high consumption class rather than women from the poorer sections. 
In addition to this, the average monthly consumption expenditure in the state has also declined significantly (15%) among the poor households whereas the rich experienced an increase in consumption expenditure. So, the poor households experienced a decline in consumption spending while experiencing a fall in women WPR. This indicates both their economic as well as financial hardships. 
In India, nearly 9.2 million women were engaged as domestic workers in 2017-18 and in Delhi, the approximate figure was more than two lakh in the same year. Similarly, in health and social work, women were largely involved as ASHA and Anganwadi workers and were not on direct payroll. Because of this, most of their services were considered “voluntary work,” though they often performed roles which was beyond their contracts.

That's not fair!|Clearly Asian Men are racist then.. privilege!  Privilege! Privilege! Privilege!|So two out of the top 3 earners are women !|Yes, women do earn less, as a whole. But that isn’t due to sexism or discrimination, the wage gap was calculated by taking all the money that men earn in the Us, and all the money that women earn, and dividing them. They didn’t take ANYTHING else into account, such as work hours, qualifications, or even what jobs they have. If you didn’t know, women take up the majority of the top 5 lowest paying fields, and men make up the majority of 4 of the top 5 highest paying fields. You don’t think that has a little something to do with the gap? Or maybe it’s due to the fact that on average, men work more hours than women. I really wish people would stop believing in this myth, it’s been debunked time after time.

I asked for (and successfully received) my first raise at age 16. I don’t know where I learned this - but I knew I was contributing more and decided to ask‼️ It's easy to leave money on the table. Why? For most of us, even the thought of negotiating for a better pay and circumstances makes us nervous. 😖We tell ourselves “I’d be greedy to ask.” or “They won’t like me.” We may not know where to start or what words to use. So we take what is offered.

Here’s the thing: asking for more money, benefits, and a better work situation is a skill you CAN learn and start practicing right now. ⏱Hey, you may even be doing this without realizing it!

In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don’t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn’t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week.
Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is “choice.” The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap “may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.” Well, let’s look at some of those choices.",21

They talk about women aren't getting paid their value but COMPLETELY MISS that a number of women don't know their value. 
They say women aren't promoted but COMPLETELY MISS women are asking to be promoted and/or aren't asking the right way.

They say women aren't getting to the C-Suite but COMPLETELY MISS that women aren't aware of the game or don't want to play the political games it takes to get there. 
Don't get twisted ladies. 
Either you're playing the game or you're being played.

678,80,"#TuesdayThoughts answering one of my most FAQs, “I know I should negotiate my salary, but I’m scared. What if the company rescinds my offer?” 🤔
My answer: Well...yeah, they might. It happened to me. A few years ago I applied for a role at an EdTech company. The position was too junior for me and the pay was very low, but I figured I could move up the ranks quickly. When the recruiter called to make an offer, I submitted a counter and they said they would get back to me. They did, and there was no change. So I countered again, this time asking for 2 work from home days a week. When the recruiter called me this time she said, “We’ve discussed your ask with the director and it seems like this role would not be a good fit for you at this time.” 🤯 I panicked and said “Wait...no, I think we can work this out”. She cringed, said “I’m sorry” and awkwardly hung up the phone 😬 I started crying, I really screwed up. HERE COMES THE MORAL OF THE STORY- This experience helped me realize how valuable my experience was, and that I was no longer willing to be underpaid for it. That was the last job I applied for before founding Chloe Taylor Technology. I wanted to do the work I was passionate about and get paid fairly for it. Remember, “Man’s rejection is God’s protection.” I KNEW I would have been miserable in that role, and not getting it helped shape my whole future. If the company says no, it’s not necessarily a bad thing, it may have saved you from a future you didn’t want anyway.",wagegap,|#femalefounders  #stem #girlswhocode  #tech #inspo #education  #entrepreneur  #femalefounders  #motivation #business #womeninbusiness #wagegap #blackwomensequalpayday #negotiation #startup #money #salary #ladiesgetpaid #womeninstem #motivationmonday|Inspiring forreal!|WHEWWWW THISSSSSS 😩🙌🏾|👏🏾👏🏾 This!!!|I feel like you two need to virtually meet @chloetaylortech and @pauleannareid over this post! ❤️|👏🏽💖|I don’t know who needs to hear this but...

694,96,"Back in March after the mass shooting in mosques happened in New Zealand, New Zealand’s prime minister vowed to ban guns within 24 hours. Yet here we are, after 2,128 mass shootings since 2013 in the United States, with no change when it comes to gun control. JUST THE PAST 6 YEARS. That’s roughly 1 shooting per day. 
There were about 10,000 deaths alone in 2019 from gun violence (about 20,000 injuries). WE DON’T HAVE ANY TIME LEFT. This is how serious it is. It could be anyone at any given moment. We need leaders in powerful positions that will sacrifice their own self interest (corporate interests, reputation preservation) to actually work for the people. We need legislation for gun control. Drastic changes in our current firearm access laws. The constitution was designed to adapt to our current progress as a society, not stay stagnant in its place from the 18th century. And gun reform is now a necessity, not a choice for the survival of the constitution and preserving the rights and lives of Americans.

(3rd slide, 2nd point). That's all the late term abortions|The second slide gave my heart a big uwu 🥺🥰🥰😭|While I agree with this, we need to address the fact that sometimes people do get late term abortions because they want to. An example is the now queen of Spain, who aborted when she was 6 months pregnant, only because if she had the baby she couldn’t marry the prince or be part of the royal family (she was pregnant from another guy). As well as many underage and young girls who, bc of many reasons, cannot abort until late term pregnancy (whether it’s because they didn’t tell or bc they are kept waiting in the abortion clinic process, etc). We should also address the fact that technically, beyond seven months, it can be considered a baby, or at least, an alive being (since actually seven-month-old fetuses can survive outside the womb and be born, apart from having all their inner systems and organs developed, except the size, and they do show signs of reaction like hiccups, kicks, etc). So in conclusion, abortion is a rough subject that cannot be treated lightly, and I believe we cannot generalise all abortion cases. (Im pro-choice, and while I totally understand if a woman has to abort bc of dangerous medical reasons, late term abortions can be...sketchy at best)",2126
698,100,#womenintheworkplace #womenofcolorintheworkplace #paygap #wagegap #paydisparity #equalpay #equalpayday,wagegap,"|Yes, women do earn less, as a whole. But that isn’t due to sexism or discrimination, the wage gap was calculated by taking all the money that men earn in the Us, and all the money that women earn, and dividing them. They didn’t take ANYTHING else into account, such as work hours, qualifications, or even what jobs they have. If you didn’t know, women take up the majority of the top 5 lowest paying fields, and men make up the majority of 4 of the top 5 highest paying fields. You don’t think that has a little something to do with the gap? Or maybe it’s due to the fact that on average, men work more hours than women. I really wish people would stop believing in this myth, it’s been debunked time after time. Also, if employers were actually able to get away with paying women less, do you not think they would then hire only women? Do you really believe they’re more worried about paying the male employees more than the female ones than they are about their own profits? Because that is honestly hilarious.|Also I see you decided to leave out Asian men as according to these studies about the mythical “wage gap” Asian men make more on the dollar than white men. So riddle me this: is that due to the fact that more Asian men own businesses and have higher paying job which leads to the average Asian man earning more than the average white man or is it a matter of privilege?",2

705,107,"On average, American working women are paid 80 cents for every dollar that working men make. For some ethnicities however, the pay gap is much larger than that, as data provided by the National Women's Law Center shows. While Asian American women get paid more than the average woman in the U.S., Latina women, Native American women and Black women fare much worse. Latinas get paid no more than 53 cents for every dollar white, non-Hispanic men make. According to these earnings, Latina's Equal Pay Day is almost eight months later than for women overall. While the average woman in the U.S. would have to work until April 2, 2019, to earn as much as the average man, Latinas would have to work until Nov 20 to earn as much as white, non-Hispanic men earned in 2018.

708,110,"My (male) friend asks me why do I keep writing about female issues all the time? Why do I keep talking about their rights, their condition, about feminism and ""all that shit""? I don't blame him. I understand where he's coming from. I know he's aware of the hypocrisy that goes around in the name of #metoo #womenempowerment and #feminism. My professor at college told me that Dalits believe that only Dalits can pen down Dalit literature for nobody else can understand their pain or the centuries of oppression that they have been suffering from. I think it is the same with us women. Just like I do not understand what men face on a day to day basis or what other genders face. I can only share my personal experience and of the women  around me. This is why I don't think men are completely capable of understanding how much patriarchy has seeped into our lives and is making our lives hell. How we live our lives in fear, have our choices made by others, have our wings clipped because ""log kya kahenge?"" and ""ladkiyan aise nahi karti"" and ""sharm to aurat ka gehna hai"". This is probably a cliched post. Somebody somewhere in the world must have written something similar. But there has to be a reason why this is so cliched? Because women are suffocating within the confines of messed up societal rules. Because we are treated as the ""Other"", as the marginalized, as the periphery. We are never the centre. And yes, #mansplaining is real, very real too. It is not an exaggerated notion being spread by the perpetually angry, man - hating and man - eating radical feminists and pseudo feminists. We have often been made to feel inferior by the men around us, because we are ""women"" and can't think for ourselves!

It's high time now that we start talking about gender equality, about feminism only in its truest sense, about wage gap, about work place harassment and sexual harassment and education and menstruation and abortion and the emancipation of women. And I will continue writing about women. I may not make a change, but I am trying to do so with my words.

I fuckin care about y’all. About myself. I used to not care about myself or anybody else for that matter. I used to let people use my time, energy, money and ask for nothing in return. I hadn’t thought I was good enough. Deserving. Worthy enough to ask for what I wanted. Wasn’t no fat, Black Muslim creators getting paid, so who did I think I was?
I’m so tired of popular organizations and brands wanting to use my platform, my voice, my hard work and thousands upon thousands of dollars in investments for free. In return for exposure. Popularity. 
Fuck popularity. 
They will utilize and tokenize marginalized bodies for a come up. Fat bodies, dark skin, or queer. Immigrants and Muslims. Ask us to work for free. Tell us we don’t have a right to ask for our worth. But can find the budgets to pay and fully accommodate white/white passing and straight size individuals. 
I have turned down several huge deals because they offered nothing or pennies for the same amount of work they offered a size 2 Britney. 
I’m not desperate for exposure. Never will be. I’ve survived this long with my community. What’s meant for me will never pass me. Believe it. What you’re not going to do is tokenize me. You will pay me for my work. My craft. I won’t be the only person of color, the only Muslim working for free when the girl next to me is getting cashed out. Periodt. 
Now here’s a photo of me looking like a bombshell Hijabi Barbie!

It is slowly changing but those discriminations in the workplace are difficult to change so yes they work less hours. But they work their ass out because they also are more exposed to be fired because of those insecurities, and they still are paid 20% less per hour than a man (in France).

___
The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are working. Women are generally paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: unadjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience.
___
For example, someone who takes time off (e.g. maternity leave) will likely not earn as much as someone who does not take time off from work. In the United States, for example, the unadjusted average female's annual salary has commonly been cited as being 78% of the average male salary, compared to 80–98% for the adjusted average salary.

Which means they work more dangerous jobs which is why some of them are higher paid. This argument is futile in that before arguing the counter of a wage gap there has to be considerable evidence that there is a wage gap. And there just simply isn’t. The variables needed to determine if someone is compensated fairly would require each employees employer to give private details as to why employee x makes this much and employee y makes that much.|Stop asking dumb questions we know the answer to,  this use of media is so fucking old n stupid|In general, no, but in a few certain industries, yes.|U know it fucking exist|It doesn't exist, but it's much smaller than most people think. It's about 6 percent|Not in the way it’s usually talked about. The reason women are typically shown to be payed less on average is because of the hours they work, quality or work they do, or the fact that less women work in that field. Very rarely do companies pay women less for the same work as men, and when they do, they get penalized.|No|No there is too much proof that is doesn’t exist that feminists deny because they want to play the victim 🤭|No|That theory has been debunked again and again. Some people just can't get that through their thick skulls.|All these little tidbits about part time or it’s a waitress job is a crap argument get a new one 😂|Yes it does if you base it on the past years absolutely, wage gap between non trained women and men is it true thing an untrained get paid less men get paid more even if you're not trait women who have all the skills kid paid less than the guy that doesn't, I'm a guy I've seen it so the wage Gap, truly there should be a $15 minimum wage, everybody said when the minimum wage went up to 7 25 it would break the back of the economy didn't do any such thing, $15 an hour won't break anything, but it may give the lower end of the bracket some extra spending money to put back into the economy which in turn will boost the economy, what should everybody get paid equally if you have the skills you should get paid regardless of your gender, that is not the way it is done, thank you for your time|No. It is illegal to pay in such discriminatory ways. Men do earn more money every year than women do, but they do not earn more per hour. Men work more overtime, are more likely to ask for raises and promotions, and typically work in higher up positions than women. That is cause for the wage gap. So its not really a wage gap, its an earnings gap.|Yes. I make $.25 less as a journeyman meatcutter than my gf who is a fry cook at burger king.|it happens in rare and isolated cases, sometimes favoring men, sometimes women, but in general it doesn't happen.|Yes. Like a few cents|Nope|When you genuinely understand what the wage gap is, yes it exists. But no, one gender is not paid less for the exact same job. Thats illegal here.|No it doesn’t|No, there is no wage gap. However in the realm of gender gap and where different genders work that is quite substantial. The vast majority of high risk jobs (skilled or unskilled) are held by men.|Noo|Yes. Female models make more. 😂🤣😅. Jk idgaf|Yes the wage gap exists but in a perfectly reasonable and legitimate way.

729,131,"Hi! I'm Annie.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I believe that you, yes YOU, are designed for greatness. My mission in life is to help people be happier, healthier, and wealthier as they create their dream life and step into their greatness in all aspects of their life. Rad mission, right?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I wasn't always as happy as I am in this picture. (This picture, by the way, was taken on my 38th birthday and YES, I'm wearing face jewels.)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was a big firm lawyer for 8 years. I was the Editor-in-Chief of the International Law Journal, did not just one by two moot courts, graduated at the top of my class...oh and also got a masters degree in applied economics during the time I was in law school. NBD.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I tell you all this not to brag, but to tell you that I was addicted to achievement. I LOOOOOOOOVED hearing my dad say ""my daughter is a laywer."" If there was another rung to climb, an award to go for, I was ABOUT IT.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Then I graduated and started working at my big law firm. The ""best"" law firm in Minneapolis, the job that everyone wanted. Guess what? IT WAS SO NOT FOR ME. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
These are the things I love: playing outside, working out, traveling, developing deep relationships with people, dancing and having fun. None these things are present in big law life, unless you count ""deep relationships"" as commiserating with my also super unhappy colleagues over happy hour on a regular basis.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For years, I just looked around and saw everyone else miserable, exhausted, overwhelmed and on edge and thought ""okay this is adulting, this is what they pay us the big bucks for."" But then I started to listen deeper, look wider, and think about what my life might look like if I wasn't a lawyer...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So here's my question to you today: do you love your job or your business? Because it's possible, I PROMISE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Canada Labour Code Amendments Coming into Force - clickable link in bio @springlawfirm ✅ .
Calling all federal sector employers! Significant amendments to the Canada Labour Code come into force on September 1, 2019. That’s this coming Sunday. .
Does this apply to you? .
Employers are often confused by the various workplace laws and requirements. It’s tricky to know which apply and not every law applies to every workplace. .
In Canada, the Constitution divides power between the federal and provincial governments. Here is a fun article if you want to delve more deeply into this topic. .
The Canada Labour Code is a federal law which sets out minimum employment standards for sectors that fall under federal power. These are generally sectors that go between the provinces, for example, air travel, railways and road transportation. It also applies to the telecommunications sector, banks and federal Crown corporations. .
For workplaces not involved in banking, telecommunications, air transport etc., minimum employment standards will be set by the provincial law. In Ontario, this is the Employment Standards Act. .
What’s New?

742,144,"Did you know there were four dramatic policy changes in the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s that started the first narrowing of the Gender Pay Gap: * Lifting of marriage bars from employment (1966 in the Commonwealth Public Service) * The ruling of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1969 that women should receive equal pay to men for equal work
* The passing of the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 and * The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act in 1986.

It's 50 years since the landmark legislation on equal pay was passed. In 2019 the national gender pay gap reached its lowest level in 20 years at 14%. #equalpayday is an observance day which was started to raise public awareness of the pay gap between men and women.

743,145,"Did you know there were four dramatic policy changes in the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s that started the first narrowing of the Gender Pay Gap: * Lifting of marriage bars from employment (1966 in the Commonwealth Public Service) * The ruling of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1969 that women should receive equal pay to men for equal work
* The passing of the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 and * The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act in 1986.

It's 50 years since the landmark legislation on equal pay was passed. In 2019 the national gender pay gap reached its lowest level in 20 years at 14%. #equalpayday is an observance day which was started to raise public awareness of the pay gap between men and women.

750,152,"Disclaimer: repost from a fellow pharmacist I follow @pharmacistmomsuzy ...I must have missed this part in history class where it was decided that wage inequality was okay for people doing the same work/job with the same amount of education or experience to equate the difference. ..................................................That being said on this topic of equality in pharmacy, pharmacist of both parties should be paid the same amount because there’s absolutely no reason - both genders do the same work (management of patients’ medication, disease state, patient education, and the list goes on) - except what will be said further down the post here. It’s time for equal wage across the board and the powers that be can’t do it then it’s time for them to move over so we can bring people who will. .............................................................I’m a little late to this posting but the message is still this: Women of any profession should be paid the same as Men in that profession, there is no reason or excuse to not do so. Everyone must challenge the notion of this deep rooted issue that for whatever reason men are better than women and therefore need to be paid more. This antiquated way of thinking is slowly changing but not fast enough. The fact that we need a #womenequalityday to spread this message is proof that inequality still exists. We all agree that change takes time but it has been 50+ years since women started entering the workforce and to see that after all these women are still earning less than their male counterparts for the same amount of work is disheartening. However it is 2019 and it’s time for companies big and small and bring about wage equality. …..................................................................#womenpharmacists #pharmacy #repost #womenequalityday #bosswomen #noexcuses #pharmacymom #bossladymindset #bosslady #womeninbusiness #womeninbiz #womenempowerment #timesup #wagegap #equalpay #equality #equalitycantwait",wagegap,"|This is so retarded the men would probably get paid more because they probably work more hours unlike women who want a flexible schedule to take care of their kids at home or something.

752,154,"We’ve come a long way on the road to equality. Today, #WomensEqualityDay, celebrates the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote on August 26,1920. (It's important to note that many women of color and other minorities still experienced barriers to casting their ballot, which remained until the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965). Despite the strides we’ve made, we have a long way to go: Women make up less than 24% of Congress. Less than 23% of Fortune 500 board seats are held by women. Just 2.3% of VC funding goes to female-led businesses. We won’t stop until we achieve #equality!

761,163,"Today is #womensequalityday ; which recognizes the passing of the 19th amendment allowing women the right to vote.

Some may consider this day as a time to celebrate, but it’s hardly a celebration. While we’ve been “afforded” our innate rights to vote, we are ways away for equality.

Yes - back to the gender wage gap!

Just to briefly reintroduce myself, my name is Adanna and I’m 2 things: 1) a certified HR professional and 2) a professional resume writer. I’ve been in my HR profession roughly 9 years, and I’ve seen some thangs.

However, I’ll quickly use myself for this gender wage gap example. When I was “promoted” to HR Manager almost 5 years ago, they were trying to pull a fast one on me.

NO INCREASE!!! 🧐

Um kayyy... shall we go back to my [white male] predecessor who lacked the actual knowledge and experience, but received an increase?! I was fully prepared to play the race/gender card🤷🏾‍♀️ - just saying

Long story short, it was my predecessor who actually ATTEMPTED to pay me $0 for a “promotion” - internal promotions can be a b#%!? sometimes 🙄

But this is how the gender wage gap widens. Companies not wanting to pay as they should, picking and choosing who gets what based off of nothing, and point blank not valuing the women in the workplace.

Physical and mental abuse in the work place, in addition to the hectic job itself, deteriorates the employees efficiency and health. The job is highly needed and demanded; however, some jobs need  better facilities for functioning and an increasing supply of labor.👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

(📸 pointclickcare) (📸 businessinsider)",wagegap,"|They probably have sleep work shift disorder! I know a lot of nurses and those 9pm-9am shifts are brutal!|Better working conditions for our nurses!|I guess just better working conditions and maybe trying to promote nursing more to get more people in to lighten the load.  Other than that it’s just like a first responder or member of the military.  They’re hard and stressful jobs filled with messed up things.  There is bound to be higher suicides regardless of how much easier or safer you can make the job.  Just like with a cop.  You can make his job as safe and easy as possible but seeing a little child burnt in a car or something is still going to have the same effect.|A lot of these things revolve somewhat around pay, don’t they? Pay them more and more people consider nursing a viable career option, which then lightens the load of those already in the profession. Higher pay usually also equals more respect. This doesn’t only apply to nurses but other professionals as well. 
For example early childhood education is one of the lowest paid degrees professions. It’s invaluable for working parents and pivotal in raising happy healthy well adjusted children. Yet, it’s a high turnover, under paid career choice.
Attracting quality people is vital.|Cosidering that nurses work long shifts and spend much of their valuable time in the workplace, there should definitely be career progression and more choices on the long run. People who decide to pursue nursing are usually the most kind and sweet people who want to make a difference in the world. And because of that we usually take them for granted. At the end they are individuals who need the same things as everyone else: career progression, trying different things, paid leave and vacations. We should care for a valuable workforce like that ♥️|Consider their workload and the hierarchy pecking order..who spends the most time with sick and terminal patients..who takes the brunt of the job physically and emotionally and mentally...shit roles down hill...that's the way life is...especially when driven by the almighty dollar!💔|I don't believe money will solve the problem with the stress the nurses feel...the job attracts a certain type of person..not the pay scale..the Corporate take over of the medical practice and having patient care fall by the wayside is breaking the spirit of those that got into the field to help not stay in the budget black!! I feel that is the problem..The corporate take over of medicine...patient care be damned...bottom line is ALL THAT MATTERS...",84

Black women earn 61 cents for every dollar their white male counterpart earns. This means black women must work four months more than white women and eight months into the “new” year before earning as much as a white male does. This is not okay. ⁣

*March 5, 2019 - Asian women compared to white men
*April 2, 2019 - All women compared to all men
*April 19, 2019 - White women compared to white men
*Aug 22, 2019 - Black women compared to white men
*Sept 23, 2019 - Native women compared to white men

Racism and sexism isn’t just a thing of the past. Rather, it’s baked into the very foundations of our society, and it continues to hold Black women back.

Today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay, which signifies the 223 extra days it took Black women to earn what a white man earned in 2018. This wage gap has only widened and will continue to do so unless we support efforts like the Paycheck Fairness Act, $15 minimum wage, and family-leave policies that acknowledge and account for the unique challenges Black women face in the workforce.

Change is happening but it’s slow and it’s unequal. Posting this today because it’s black women’s equal pay day. It’s on August 22 because it takes full-time black women workers 234 days to catch up with what their white men colleagues earned in 2018 alone.

817,219,"Today is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day.

According to @leaninorg, that means #Black #women had to work all of 2018 and until this day in 2019 to catch up with what #white #men were paid in 2018 alone. And it’s not like they’re not doing their part to bridge the wage gap. They’re asking for #promotions and #raises at about the same rate as white women, but they get worse results.

Some startling statistics from @leaninorg :

On average, Black women in the US are paid 39% less than white men and 21% less than white women.

The pay gap actually widens for women at higher #education levels.

The pay gap starts early. From age 16, Black #girls are paid less than #boys their same age, and the gap only widens from there.

The gap hurts women and #families, especially since more than 80% of Black #mothers are the main breadwinners of their #households.

#Kings and #Queens, SPEAK UP for your Black women friends, #colleagues, #family members, #friends, and COMEPLETE STRANGERS today. They deserve better.

That means today marks the exact number of days (an entire 7 months and 22 days longer) it takes Black women to work in order to equal the 2018 salaries of white men in the same roles. Nationally, Black women earn an average of $0.61 for every dollar earned by white men. Our white counterparts hit their equal pay day back in April of this year and our Native American and Latinx sisters reach their equal pay days on September 23 and November 20, respectively. These kinds of wage disparities take an extraordinary toll on our lives. A 2017 study indicated that over a 40-year career, women of color lose almost $870,000 as a result of the wage gap.

854,256,"Today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay. 💰 On average, black women are paid 38% less for every dollar of work compared to a white man (and less than 21% compared to white women). That translates to nearly $870,000 in lost earnings over the course of an average career.

On average, it takes black women 20 months to match what a white man earns in 12. That means black women had to work all of 2018 and up to this day August 22, 2019 to make as much as white men made last year alone. Last year that date came two weeks earlier on August 7, 2018. 🎥: @sherylsandberg for @leaninorg",wagegap,"|.

As the wage gap stands today, a Black woman who works for 40 years will lose $946,120, according to the National Women’s Law Center. And the #wagegap hurts women's families: ""84.4% of black mothers were primary, sole, or co-breadwinners in 2017, compared with 60.3 percent of Latina mothers and 62.4 percent of white mothers,"" according to Center for American Progress.⁠

Black Women’s Equal Pay Day is the approximate day a Black woman must work into the new year to make what white non-Hispanic man made at the end of the previous year. ⠀
⠀
""Unfortunately, black and hispanic candidates are experiencing the worst of the current salary disparity, says Hired. Using White males as the baseline, Asian men made the same ($1, for argument’s sake). White and Asian women made 97 cents on the dollar, while Hispanic men made 94 cents. Black men and Hispanic women earned 91 cents. Black women were the most affected, earning an average of 89 cents on the dollar when compared to the mark set by White and Asian males.""⠀

Going to sleep at night? Shouldn't the Bering Sea and several thousand king crab be in front of the guys? 😂|In the western world I agree with you, but int he middle east and the Arab world the picture is partially correct. Just some more hurdles infront of men.|I hate pictures like this because it's always the men that seem to have a much harder time making it anywhere worthwhile in the west anymore. These bitches just be complaining about normal basic responsibilities as if though men don't do that shit too (they do this isn't the 1950's anymore people).|😑😒|Yep. Men never struggle with anything. Nothing at all.|Put a hole ass coal mine on our side|Most good men will try to share the work load at home no matter what jobs each have.|If they just did the laundry earlier there wouldn’t be any work to do|Men's life aren't that easy ok|They got the inside lane so they got the advantage|The men aren’t even trying to win this race. They are stuck helping the women get through everything. Then they run on a path that includes hard work to buy the woman a bottle of water to help her along in the race. Don’t tell me men don’t have to do shit in life.|I hope your kid(s) realizes what a shitty mom they have and disowns you. As a woman you should be fighting for women to be seen as equal, not posting shit that just supports the idea that men are superior to women, which is not the case. A feminist wants equality for both genders down to the housework down to the fucking penny on the payroll. Stop being an idiot because you’ve only ever experienced extremists. And you don’t have a right to have an opinion if it’s this offensive and degrading to your own gender. You along with every single person who has this opinion actually has NO RIGHT to have this opinion. It’s again offensive AND degrading. You’re degrading yourself and you seem really stupid. God will not save you, believe me there’s a special place in hell for you, rest assured.|Oh fuck off these women are ridiculous. WE'RE NOT VICTIMS|Omg i love your content but this is some crap. Im exactly that woman. I cant complain tho. It was my choice to marry a narcissistic psycho sho stole from me. Now my choice was keep living and getting beat and played on or be the woman on the left. I honestly love my life tho. Ive been blessed and i got my family’s support but so many women dont have a choice.|That’s how it used to be for sure, not anymore tho. At least in America|Lol man work harder than women|This picture should have the men dressed in camouflage carrying guns. Their obstacles being minefields, bombs and other people with firearms and explosives. The end of their race is almost always death, while women and children have a safe country at the end of theirs|Feminist post in a anti-feminist hastag|The pic is very deep to understand because , usually in a race with a circle running track , the people who are placed towards the inner part of the track are usually placed behind , but here the women are given a kind of head start by placing them ahead but they also have these obstacles that would slow them down , either way I would say that men and women are equally placed in the race of life . (Ty , and sorry if I've offended anyone)|This picture is a joke|This is where feminism should work upon and should work upon the REAL struggle they are facing instead just filling false rape cases against men and just fighting for useless things|Why are the women staring at the men who are so focused tho|The women have a ten second head start...😒|What are they doing outside of their kitchen?|Gosh I must be a man then 😩 I had babies stayed at home did all that for 3 years (not because I was oppressed) and now my partner is doing the same whilst I work|Yo actually find me a nice woman to give me the chores, I don’t fucking mind not working, just love me bitch|Thank you for this.  Very appreciated.  Being a man is no easy task. Most modern women wouldnt last one week in a man's shoes.|This pictures says nothing|Yeah, it’s her choice to do whatevs but it’s a rare privilege of the upper class to actually do so. Under our current capitalist climate, she most likely can’t go without a paycheck. Whether she’s single and working two jobs or married with children and three jobs between the two adults, the question isn’t should she be allowed to stay home but who can afford to, and why some people cannot. Then fix that.|This is retarded|Actually this says nothing to me. If anything it is saying stfu and just live life|Lol 😂😂😂😂 it coudln't be further from the truth|Someone has to do it. I work long hours in a manual labour job and i still do shit at home. Not all of it but if I dont do it I get judgement that my partner doesnt get. Its assumed to be my role even though I work full time. I know so many women doing both, not out of choice but out of necessity. Either because both them and their partner work, or because its just them or because they are pressured into being the one to do it. Someone has to do it, and it usually ends up being a woman because thats what we as a society expect.|This is so dumb!|Just shut the fuck up ... I LIVE Alone and i Do All Of these but I'm not fucking complaining... Y'all got 2 hands and 2 legs get your ass together And Just do what you are supposed do|🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣|And when men fuckin do these things for women, they complain and say ""yOu ThInK wE aRe To WeAk To Do ThInGs OuR sElVeS!?!?""|A strong woman would be able to get all the laundry and cooking done and still manage to beat the men to the finish line.",606

It’s crazy that in 2019, Black women STILL make 61 cents for every dollar that white men make. Over a 40-year career, this translates into $946,120 in lost wages. Racism and sexism isn’t just a thing of the past. Rather, it’s baked into the very foundations of our society, and it continues to hold Black women back.

This wage gap has only widened and will continue to do so unless we support efforts like the Paycheck Fairness Act, $15 minimum wage, and family-leave policies that acknowledge and account for the unique challenges Black women face in the workforce.

According to @leaninorg, that means #Black #women had to work all of 2018 and until this day in 2019 to catch up with what #white #men were paid in 2018 alone. And it’s not like they’re not doing their part to bridge the wage gap. They’re asking for #promotions and #raises at about the same rate as white women, but they get worse results.

Some startling statistics from @leaninorg :

On average, Black women in the US are paid 39% less than white men and 21% less than white women.

The pay gap actually widens for women at higher #education levels.

The pay gap starts early. From age 16, Black #girls are paid less than #boys their same age, and the gap only widens from there.

The gap hurts women and #families, especially since more than 80% of Black #mothers are the main breadwinners of their #households.

929,32,"Today is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day 2019. That means today marks the exact number of days (an entire 7 months and 22 days longer) it takes Black women to work in order to equal the 2018 salaries of white men in the same roles. Nationally, Black women earn an average of $0.61 for every dollar earned by white men. Our white counterparts hit their equal pay day back in April of this year and our Native American and Latinx sisters reach their equal pay days on September 23 and November 20, respectively. These kinds of wage disparities take an extraordinary toll on our lives. A 2017 study indicated that over a 40-year career, women of color lose almost $870,000 as a result of the wage gap. And here’s where the plot thickens...Black women are the most educated population in the US! Make it make sense Sway 🧐.

Today marks #blackwomensequalpayday, the approximate day a Black woman must work into the new year to make what a white non-Hispanic man made at the end of the previous year. Based on ACS Census data, the 2019 wage gap for Black women and men is 61 cents.

Black women deserve to be paid fairly for their work. We must value Black women’s work and that starts with #BlackWomensEqualPay.

966,69,"Black women make $0.61 to every dollar a white man makes. August 22 is Black Women's Equal Pay Day because it marks ""the approximate day a Black woman must work into the new year to make what white non-Hispanic man made at the end of the previous year,"" according to @equalpay2dayorg.⁠
⁠
As the wage gap stands today, a Black woman who works for 40 years will lose $946,120, according to the National Women’s Law Center. And the #wagegap hurts women's families: ""84.4% of black mothers were primary, sole, or co-breadwinners in 2017, compared with 60.3 percent of Latina mothers and 62.4 percent of white mothers,"" according to Center for American Progress.⁠

For all those politicians who say they care about families, do more than just pay us lip service. Pay us what you owe us, so we can take care of our families! ⁠

The pay gap is widening, and black women make 61 cents compared to the dollar a white, non-Hispanic male makes.
This is why @leaninwomenofcolor and its partners are committed to creating conversations around the pay gap. We feel that learning from the voices of our leaders is instrumental to change. The Black Women's Equal Pay Day Commemoration Project’s podcast series has a mission to dispose of the pay gap for black women. Visit the link in their bio. @leaninwomenofcolor

On average it takes Black women 20 months to make what white men make in 12. When I say #BringMeMyPurse, the pay gap is part of that. Black women are owed for debts both ancestral and new.

Black Women’s Equal Pay Day is the approximate day a Black woman must work into the new year to make what white non-Hispanic man made at the end of the previous year. ⠀
⠀
""Unfortunately, black and hispanic candidates are experiencing the worst of the current salary disparity, says Hired. Using White males as the baseline, Asian men made the same ($1, for argument’s sake). White and Asian women made 97 cents on the dollar, while Hispanic men made 94 cents. Black men and Hispanic women earned 91 cents. Black women were the most affected, earning an average of 89 cents on the dollar when compared to the mark set by White and Asian males.""⠀

But the sheer insensitivity and rudeness that you have displayed to trans people is just fucked up. Imagine feeling so uncomfortable in your own body, that you are willing to undergo surgery to change it, it’s not as simple as “chopping off your dick.” Things like these saddens me deeply, bc they really show that although America is a very progressive country there are still very many people who lack deep thinking skills to truly understand others or even just basic empathy and morals 😪|😂😂😂😂hell no I like REAL MEN AND MASCULINITY,  AS I AM A REAL FEMININE WOMAN|Oh i wonder why that is?? 😂",286

Thank you!|Love this one... love them all, but this one especially!  RE: lack of media attention to #lgbtq🌈 aspects of the team... maybe it doesn't matter any more?

I’ve received a few backlashes, whispers, look of confusion and dislikes about my preference with clients and business. It almost made me want to not speak of my personal life to clients but, how could I, when my strength and rock is my sweetheart...I pushed forward. This while was great, great questions, great feedback, great energy...great interviewer! Thank you, thank you Ed 🙏🙏🙏God Bless#MAXOUT|I usually like your podcast. For the most part I like the interview today. But there’s one thing I cannot understand. Many places in the Bible, GOD condemns the sin of homosexuality. He refers to it as an abomination. It’s definitely not the only sin mentioned or even the only one referred to as an abomination. Nevertheless if we don’t repent, come to Him on His terms, we are lost for eternity. When you genuinely love other people you don’t want to see them lost forever. You tell them the Truth, or you don’t really love them.|Yess|Love her humility and her strength.|What an awesome story!!!🔥🔥🔥😳😳😳|I was really excited to hear this podcast!

It's been a  long bumpy road. I actually gave up after all my help quit doing their part but thanks to your show I found courage to get back into it. I had a meeting with several groups of faith based organizations and I don't know what will come of it but thank you. I spent 15 years destroying mine and everyone around me lives.

Can't wait to listen to it.|Amazing. So sad but true. I thank God everyday for WFG #MAXOUT|This looks like it’s going to be such a great episode, I can t wait to dive in!  Just from this clip she makes an excellent point that if the challenges, experiences, demands and results are the same then so should the pay.  1,000,000,000,000% it is absurd to think any other way. I am genuinely trying to live my life as who I am more and more.  As I have I have seen such a drastic change.|Would love to share you my vision 🙌🏽|Amazing!! Looking forward to watching this podcast!! 😀😀😀😀|@heather_may07|😍👏|Phenomenal episode ! Every person should listen to this one|“Who can live with the miss.” Loved this! A lot of golden nuggets!

#iamarete|Very good episode. New subscriber here, only the second episode I’ve listened to but definitely will be one of my main podcasts. 🙏🏾|#maxout🔝|💜💜💜💜💜|🇺🇸 @edmylett|Nice #Maxout|@edmylett I loved her at C19 but could tell she had pain and sadness to a high degree. Strong and determined woman nevertheless 👏🏽✅#Maxout #womaninthegame|Sooo good🔥🔥|@antiquatedover go listen to this podcast 🔥|@edmylett can’t wait to listen at the gym tomorrow am. Been waiting on the next podcast to drop!!!|💯💯💯|Wow just finished listening, LOVED this interview. Some of my big takeaways (not all of them hahahah) - hold fast, stay true; who can live with the miss? Wow that hit me, what an awesome outlook, I never heard a coach think about it that way. I played d1 sport as well; And when she mentioned the beauty of waves 🌊 great interview Ed ! Thank you ! And thank you Jill!! #maxout #mackout #bylr|Fired up for this one !!! @jillellis_uswnt is amazing !!!!!|@edmylett thank you for not being afraid to talk about “controversial” topics. I hope it’s a great reminder to all of us to keep an open mind and have a civil discussion with others and still be able to respect each other even though we might disagree on a particular topic. #maxout|Holy! Two interviews?! The one with Tom Dempsey was great at Convention! I gotta watch this!|That's shocking #MaxOut|I’m a late bloomer when it comes to self improvement but I can honestly say your material is making a huge difference in my life. Thank you!!|She was great at the convention, Giving this a listen for sure.|🙌 love this!|Regarding pay, the unfortunate truth is that she is payed based off of the amount of money that is brought in via woman’s soccer, NOT how well she has performed. (She is clearly outperforming her male counterparts)  In order to close the gap the professional woman’s team will need to find a way to bring in more revenue. From a strictly business perspective the pay gap is justified, yet completely unjustified if looked at from a performance standpoint. She deserves more money, but business’s isn’t always about what is deserved, it’s about value.|Hold Fast and Stay True!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼|No one gives a s*** about women's soccer, I'm so sick of this pay Gap b******* argument.|Gol goh|She was one of my favorites at convention. Lived your interview with her on my ride into work. Can't wait to listen again. Remembering that your team as still just people, same everyone else. I love  her style & mentality & how it can be utilized in team, business, and life. Truly a remarkable woman to admire & follow. #MAXOUT|🔥🔥🔥 #MAXOUT|Powerful!  Thank you brother!  #maxout 😎👊💯|They don’t generate the revenue to justify the pay!  Just because you’re the best in the world at what you do doesn’t mean you SHOULD be paid anything for it.  You’ll be paid what it’s worth to those who view or buy your product.  Women’s soccer sucks... and their entitled attitudes further devalue their product.|Omg she was my favorite at convention (sorry- you’re in my top 3 for sure 😉☺️😁)|Looks like a great one Ed! Will definitely check this out soon 🔥#maxout|Always surround yourself with great people and great opportunities. #maxout have a blessed day 🙏🏼|Always higher law conversations with higher mindeset individuals.

I connected with her as a woman, as a mother, as a leader and as a person. She is soft spoken for her words have power. #MAXOUT 🔥🔥🔥|Hold fast and stay true! I love it! Been in a male dominated industry my whole career. Glass ceilings are meant to be broken. If it’s equal work then it should be equal pay #max out|Cool 👏very beautiful|#maxout  Love to see the outstanding example of Composure, strength, and  focus from this coach!  Admiration is earned for true achievements!  As a mother of 11 & 13 year old girls - these fierce women are who we need as role models!  Thank you @edmylett for shining a light on legitimate girl power!|#MAXOUT|Loved the episode 🔥|#maxout|Always bringing the goods!!🙏🏻 #MaxOut|I really loved this @jillellis_uswnt said so much that I needed to listen to about staying centred in the storm etc. What an amazing role model for young people ( & those of us who are not so young).

Have a great day ! 💜|I love the Sport 🔥❤️🔥 i been playing it all my life , the issue here is that a Coach in Europe earns 7, 8 and even €10 million. But we have to understand how much the sport can generate . USA needs to push their local Women’s League and work their way up . FiFa needs to help push it too. I have a daughter and i want her to play the beautiful game also. She is only 2 but she already knows how to kick the Soccer ball. I love the USA team , so much , i thing they have more heart ❤️ than the Mens Squad. Is all a matter of time . Thanks. Also i think is time to have a Women’s World Cup here in the USA will elevate the Sport tremendously. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|Amazing content as usual . I don’t comment and like as much as I should.

Longer term solutions, like light rail between Marina and Monterey and housing located near jobs, need champions in the public and elected office who are committed to a future that doesn’t include hours wasted sitting in traffic (even if we can exchange smiles with the drivers in adjacent cars!) #montereycounty #salinasvalley #monday #traffic #transportation #wagegap #working #regional #collaboration #solutions #wendyforsupervisor #momlife #womenwholead",wagegap,|💎💎💎💎💎,11

However, a harsh truth to confront: Asia’s gender pay gap is the highest globally, with #Indian #women for example, making 34 percent less than men in hourly wage. Even in developed Asia, countries like Korea, Japan and Singapore do not come close to gender pay parity.

The figures come as part of an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) which found that CEO pay grew nearly 1,000 percent in the U.S. since 1978 while average compensation for private sector workers only went up by just under 12 percent. While the CEO-to-typical-worker compensation ratio stood at 278-to-1 in 2018 when realized stock options were included, it was 20-to-1 in 1965 and 58-to-1 in 1989. The report states that exorbitant CEO pay is fuelling rising inequality, increasing the gap between the top 1 percent of very high earners and the bottom 90 percent 🔥💰🚀📈

.
Near the end, the panel talked about guilt versus anger and asked people to share thoughts or questions. I didn’t there, but I would like to here.
.
I’ve been a mom for almost two years (when I married M, J & L’s dad) and for six months (when I had Lucy). I legit have not yet experienced mom guilt. Is this typical of my generation, and a sign of general progress for women? I don’t know. What I think is that I’m hustling too damn hard to feel guilty.
.
Anger, though—I’m familiar with that.
.
1. There are next to no resources for stepmoms. Even the internet is generally a gaping void. Nor is there a lot of positive social acknowledgement. While it was really special to be congratulated on my first Mother’s Day this past May, I was also kind of thinking, “Y’all, this isn’t my first Mother’s Day, it’s just the first one anyone’s acknowledged.” (Stepmoms and stepdads, I SEE YOU and you’re legit. ✊🏼)
.
2. Parental leave in the US completely sucks. It’s crappy that as a federal employee my “benefits” are 12 weeks of unpaid leave *if approved by my agency.* I’m using it all but you want to talk about a wage gap? How about I’m forfeiting a quarter of my salary this year to care for my infant/future taxpayer? Thanks Uncle Sam. 🦅What’s even more unconscionable is that my husband, as a contract employee (in landscape architecture, a profession for which he has a master’s degree and in which he’s never been able to secure salaried employment), was able to take ZERO days of parental leave. Lucy was born on a Sunday, he worked Monday while I was in the hospital, and on Tuesday morning he got approval to go in late so he could pick us up first thing and get us settled at home. BUT HE STILL HAD TO GO IN.
.
So the list goes on, but these are my main points. And I’m working on them. I’m soooooooo tiiiiiiiirrrrrred. But hey, we shall overcome, okay?

1097,200,"""When I first came to Dorianne, I had been working at my previous company for almost 3 ½ years. Although I enjoyed the work I was doing, I did not enjoy being overlooked by management, dealing with department politics and being severely underpaid.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
I knew it was time for me to move on to the next level in my career, but I wanted to make sure I didn’t make the mistake so many of us make of starting at a new company that looks good on the surface but ends up being exactly like the company we're running from.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
When it comes to career coaching, there are tons of coaches out there that talk a good game, but Dorianne helps you actually achieve your goals. She listened to me, pushed me and gave me the confidence to kill it in my job search. Working with her got me real results.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Dorianne coached me through the entire interview process from start to finish. She used her “Interviewer Psychology” method to tap into the mind of my interviewers and helped position myself as a thought leader and showcase all the value I could bring to the table. ⁣⠀
⁣⠀
I ended up getting the offer for the role – which came with a $45,000 raise, flexibility and more visibility than I had in my previous position."" ⁣⠀

So by saying that^ apparently men are hating on men???|nah thems the feminazis|FEMINISM AND FEMINAZIS ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT|And your mom should of had a abortion|gosh, feminists want equality, stop hating on everything dude|Lol when they think men are better even tho us feminists want equality like damn|FEMINISTS WANT TO DECREASE TOXIC MASCULINITY WHICH WOULD SOLVE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS|You know, Feminism also acknowledges the toxicity men face today also. Feminist hate what society’s standards are like gender roles. They encourage men to convey how they feel, in a respectful way of course. I’m not even going to get into the other things they believe in because I’m really not in the mood to see your false logic. But I will say this, Feminism is just about equality. If you’ve taken anthropology, you’d know that throughout ancient history, and not so long ago history, women were perceived as possessions. Disregarded, objectified, discriminated against, etc. Not saying that men haven’t faced those adversities, but women have faced the majority of it throughout history with this possession mentality. In conclusion, Feminism is about being equal. Where both can live together in harmony without all these expectations.|Man power!|truth 🔥|Ohh but apparently women need to be paid more? Fuck that. Women rag our asses constantly about not doing anything and they end up sleeping all night when we should apparently be fixing the lawnmower at midnight when everyone's asleep. Answer me that Linda. Lol. 🤣|Im sorry but your account is he reason we need feminism. It is not about man hating, it is trying to improve the lives of both men and women. Please stop grouping together those who are actually perusing change, which is most feminists, with the very few who take it too far|@meredith__h how are you going to complain about feminists being grouped together by some which are not all, then complain that this page only deals with the opinion of WHITE males?? I know multiple white, black, asian, and Hispanic people who support Trump! #racist|@phoenix.arts2309|Ngl this is fuckin stupid lmao|This is true. Im an equalist. I want both genders to be equal. Let men have their shit and women have theirs|If a so cold feminist truly cared about equality for both the sexes while watching that feminism is a sinking ship that has lost it's way and its dictionary definition that all try to fall back on. If that person truly cares about equality for both, then they would jump ship and abandon the now religion known as feminism, they would see that it hurts a genuine cause...but that's only if they actually truly cared. Feminism once had a need to be around,  now it looks for lifeline causes to keep it alive & relevant. All it's becoming relevant for now is causing division, hate, depression and preferential treatment of cherry picked women who don't go script from the religion itself. If a genuine equalitarion that wasn't blinded by the tribal religiosity of feminism saw this, they would walk away from what they good and well see as a damaging ideology. Basically if you care about fairness & equality,  you don't need feminism, you don't need tribalism, all you need is your care & actions. Feminism isn't for women or anyone else anymore,  it's for itself & the dictionary reference no longer applies & no one is fooled by it but the weak women feminism  attracts.|If God were still allowed to be in the equation then women would know their roles as well as men. I'm by no means saying that men should be in charge of women etc. Because that's not what the Bible says and also I'm a single mother that does EVERYTHING for my two sons on my own. God made us from a mans RIB in order for us to stand side by side as helpers. Not a bone from the foot, not the leg, not the head etc. The rib! We were made from a man and not the dirt bc God wanted us to be something a man cared for as part of himself that he couldn't live without. My point here is women (feminists) want to scream ""equality"" but then get upset when they aren't treated like ladies or yell abuse when they hit a man and he hits them back. At this point BC of femenists chivalry is dead. And its sad. And don't come at me for believing in God and following the Bible. I will not argue the issue and I will not change my mind. Bottom line.....know your role.|fuck youuu|100 percent agreed. But feminists seem to be more concerned with captain marvel being paid as much as captain America in the marvel movies. I guess feminism sees it as in order to solve inequality for both genders we need to focus on 1 genders problems|Feminism is a CANCER 😡|Personally,  women who play victim disgust me. Put your big girl panties on and deal with life!|💯|I've had cancer... and I'd rather have it again, than third wave feminism. 😂🙌|I will never be a feminist! Hate of one gender is never the answer, that is what current feminism is all about! It’s wrong.........",203

I strongly disagree with equal rights for the genders and for equal treatment, as well as equal pay. We have to acknowledge that men and women are different and we should play on the respective strengths that each bring to the table. That means that men will be better at some thing and women will be better at others. THIS IS OK!! It is ok to pay more to the one who does something better than the other, male or female.

S. may think the immigrants are coming here illegally but I found out that according to the Geneva Convention they have the right to immigrate?  You know there are ways to stop this.  Instead of going in and trying to get these countries to turn to democracy, raping them for their natural resources, then install a puppet head of the government, not following through with the promises we make to the puppet head of these governments all because the RETHUGLICANS are nothing but greedy ass morons and their only God is money, we need to have a multi country advisory commission to get the monster dictators out of office.  I know a lot of people won't agree with me on this.  The immigration of these desperate people are partial the  U. S. fault.  We go out and do things like Iraq.  The only thing we did wrong was George H. W. Bush didn't get Sadam Hussein in the Gulf War in 1996.  General Schwartkopt told GHWB that he needed to to get Hussein out of Iraq in 1996.  Consequently when George W. Bush became president he used the ruse of WMD to go back and finish what daddy didn't get done.  GWB made promises to generals in the Iraqi army.  ISIS came from these generals when GWB didn't keep the promises he made to them.  While I know this is no excuse for terrorism people have their limits that they can handle.  Instead of making money their God (all the greedy head of countries) they need to grow a conscious and soul.  The International community should come together and try and do something about these monster dictators like in Syria.  That was one of the things that upset me about with the rest of the international community regarding Sadam Hussein, that the only other country that was with us was England.  That France & Germany weren't with us in trying to get Satan Hussein.  France & Germany should know about what a monster was.  There should still be some people who remember WWII and what a monster Hitler.  I AM SICK OF THE STUPID, BRAIN DEAD TRDUMPSTER SUPPORTERS!!!!!!!!!!!",20

And look, we get it— it’s uncomfortable to brag on ourselves. 😬But it’s necessary.

The way to approach life is to play the hand you are dealt the best that you can.  This can include bluffing within the rules, but calling for a new deal when it was all “by the book” and others have better cards won’t fly until you win that hand.

You can & should advocate for a more fair game, but I believe that Booker T. Washington promotes & think that once you gain power, you are in a better position to make changes.

Hard work is the way to get what you want.  What that work looks like is up to you & your goals.

1163,266,"When do you refuel and recharge? 🌸🍓 It is said that one can only share with the world what one has inside. 
Oprah Winfrey is famous for saying,
“My cup runneth OVER.” 👑

You cannot dear, you cannot pour from an empty cup. So how will you refill your cup, today? 📆

As a female entrepreneur we are at high risk for over-giving and undercharging. Check out my colleague @prosperity.priestess for more on this.

This is why I have created some steps for you to ensure you are balancing your sacred service with self-care.
🌷🌸🌷🌸🌷
Check out my tips below:
.
💖 Plan ahead. - Know what you need to feel “full.” Based on knowing what works for you, have this as a go-to Self-Care Menu to refer to when you are feeling low. Continually build on this list to keep it interesting.
💖 Know the value of what you offer. - This means continually checking in with the industry rate of the services and products you offer to ensure they are fairly priced. If you price over industry rate, have substantial reason for doing so: make sure you are tracking the “invisible value” you provide and communicate that in your sales messaging. #AcknowledgeYourselfie
💖 Respond when people ask for help. Instead of helping people by default, wait until you are asked for help and then provide it only if you are able to. God places people on our path so that we can help them, and so they can help us. But we need to ask, and respond to being asked - no assumptions. * This will significantly preserve your energy reserves.
💖 Have one day a week that is sincerely and boldly for yourselfie. That means no “work” for others, invest in yourselfie, honour yourself and make the promise that by the end of the day, you’re going to feel so #Glam.

Try out these tips and let me know how it goes!! Today is my day off (Thursday’s are the entrepreneurs Saturday’s in my life ☺️🌈) I made myself a delectable omega fruit oatmeal this morning - now its time to run a crystal salt bath and read my book on the biography of Cleopatra. 
Enjoy your day lovebirds and remember to honour yourselfie, luxuriate yourselfie and treat yourselfie with loving #TLC.

You are worth it. #SelfCare",wagegap,|#fempreneur #womenempowerment #girlboss #notablelife #entrepreneur #alpha #mindset #mentalhealth #wagegap #glassceiling #valueyourself #womeninbusiness #worthit #takecareofyourself #holistichealth #coach #businesscoach|This is so cute!💕💕 Love the pink!|This is a great reminder 🙏,15

1165,268,"Have you experienced this?

According to American Association of University Women:
“Women aged 55–64 are paid 78 percent as much as men the same age, a gap more than double that of women aged 20–24. Earnings for both female and male full-time workers tend to increase with age, although they rise more slowly after age 45 and even decrease after age 55. But as workers progress in their careers, women’s median earnings grow more slowly than men’s.” https://www.aauw.org/2019/04/02/8-surprising-facts-about-the-gender-pay-gap/

Ebbene, se la risposta è si… non sei la sola!
Purtroppo infatti, solo il 7% delle donne tenta di negoziare il proprio stipendio al primo impiego, rispetto al 57% degli uomini!😱
Le donne infatti sono più timide in queste situazioni, in particolare nel chiedere un aumento (soprattutto se meritato!), un dato che viene confermato in tutte le ricerche.

Do you know what this number signifies?

39 days is how many extra days in a year that a woman would have to work to earn the same amount as a man in 2018, according to Pew Research.

It has been 55 years since the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was put into effect.

55 years.

Over half a CENTURY since this law was put into effect. Let that sink in for a minute.

During this time the pay gap has narrowed but it still hasn’t closed and if we don’t shed light on this topic it will continue to be an issue.

F**K A SEAT. LET'S ALL EAT. EQUAL PAY MATTERS.

Cast your vote to have a panel discussion at SXSW 2020 to have this discussion with women in business who are fighting the fight for equal pay every day click the link in our bio.

I do think there should be some policies on the border, but have a heart at least. You make fun of stereotypical liberals and just the entire left side in general. It’s not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong. Morally. Let me tell you this quote “Terrible things are happening outside... poor helpless people are being dragged out of their homes. Families are torn apart; men, women, and children are separated. Children come home from school to find that their parents have disappeared.” -Anne Frank There was a quote comparing gun-control to a Hitler quote. So before you get any ideas, know that this quote smashes your argument to pieces due to the actual events that happens surrounding this.|i’m begging you to educate yourself on immigration. think of the reasons people everyday will break the law & risk theirs and their children’s life to get into a country where they believe will provide them safety and a better life. ur intolerant and privileged as fuck",121

When it comes to career coaching, there are tons of coaches out there that talk a good game, but Dorianne helps you actually achieve your goals. She listened to me, pushed me and gave me the confidence to kill it in my job search. Working with her got me real results.⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Dorianne coached me through the entire interview process from start to finish. She used her “Interviewer Psychology” method to tap into the mind of my interviewers and helped position myself as a thought leader and showcase all the value I could bring to the table. ⁣⠀

I ended up getting the offer for the role – which came with a $45,000 raise, flexibility and more visibility than I had in my previous position."" ⁣⠀

So by saying that^ apparently men are hating on men???|nah thems the feminazis|FEMINISM AND FEMINAZIS ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT|And your mom should of had a abortion|gosh, feminists want equality, stop hating on everything dude|Lol when they think men are better even tho us feminists want equality like damn|FEMINISTS WANT TO DECREASE TOXIC MASCULINITY WHICH WOULD SOLVE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS|You know, Feminism also acknowledges the toxicity men face today also. Feminist hate what society’s standards are like gender roles. They encourage men to convey how they feel, in a respectful way of course. I’m not even going to get into the other things they believe in because I’m really not in the mood to see your false logic. But I will say this, Feminism is just about equality. If you’ve taken anthropology, you’d know that throughout ancient history, and not so long ago history, women were perceived as possessions. Disregarded, objectified, discriminated against, etc. Not saying that men haven’t faced those adversities, but women have faced the majority of it throughout history with this possession mentality. In conclusion, Feminism is about being equal. Where both can live together in harmony without all these expectations.|Man power!|truth 🔥|Ohh but apparently women need to be paid more? Fuck that. Women rag our asses constantly about not doing anything and they end up sleeping all night when we should apparently be fixing the lawnmower at midnight when everyone's asleep. Answer me that Linda. Lol. 🤣|Im sorry but your account is he reason we need feminism. It is not about man hating, it is trying to improve the lives of both men and women. Please stop grouping together those who are actually perusing change, which is most feminists, with the very few who take it too far|@meredith__h how are you going to complain about feminists being grouped together by some which are not all, then complain that this page only deals with the opinion of WHITE males?? I know multiple white, black, asian, and Hispanic people who support Trump! #racist|@phoenix.arts2309|Ngl this is fuckin stupid lmao|This is true. Im an equalist. I want both genders to be equal. Let men have their shit and women have theirs|If a so cold feminist truly cared about equality for both the sexes while watching that feminism is a sinking ship that has lost it's way and its dictionary definition that all try to fall back on. If that person truly cares about equality for both, then they would jump ship and abandon the now religion known as feminism, they would see that it hurts a genuine cause...but that's only if they actually truly cared. Feminism once had a need to be around,  now it looks for lifeline causes to keep it alive & relevant. All it's becoming relevant for now is causing division, hate, depression and preferential treatment of cherry picked women who don't go script from the religion itself. If a genuine equalitarion that wasn't blinded by the tribal religiosity of feminism saw this, they would walk away from what they good and well see as a damaging ideology. Basically if you care about fairness & equality,  you don't need feminism, you don't need tribalism, all you need is your care & actions. Feminism isn't for women or anyone else anymore,  it's for itself & the dictionary reference no longer applies & no one is fooled by it but the weak women feminism  attracts.|If God were still allowed to be in the equation then women would know their roles as well as men. I'm by no means saying that men should be in charge of women etc. Because that's not what the Bible says and also I'm a single mother that does EVERYTHING for my two sons on my own. God made us from a mans RIB in order for us to stand side by side as helpers. Not a bone from the foot, not the leg, not the head etc. The rib! We were made from a man and not the dirt bc God wanted us to be something a man cared for as part of himself that he couldn't live without. My point here is women (feminists) want to scream ""equality"" but then get upset when they aren't treated like ladies or yell abuse when they hit a man and he hits them back. At this point BC of femenists chivalry is dead. And its sad. And don't come at me for believing in God and following the Bible. I will not argue the issue and I will not change my mind. Bottom line.....know your role.|fuck youuu|100 percent agreed. But feminists seem to be more concerned with captain marvel being paid as much as captain America in the marvel movies. I guess feminism sees it as in order to solve inequality for both genders we need to focus on 1 genders problems|Feminism is a CANCER 😡|Personally,  women who play victim disgust me. Put your big girl panties on and deal with life!|💯|I've had cancer... and I'd rather have it again, than third wave feminism. 😂🙌|I will never be a feminist! Hate of one gender is never the answer, that is what current feminism is all about! It’s wrong.........",203

1219,23,"For every thing that men do and get credit for, and women use the gender card to belittle a man’s accomplishments, ask yourself if the woman would do the same in a similar situation and if the same act carries the same weight. I strongly disagree with equal rights for the genders and for equal treatment, as well as equal pay. We have to acknowledge that men and women are different and we should play on the respective strengths that each bring to the table. That means that men will be better at some thing and women will be better at others. THIS IS OK!! It is ok to pay more to the one who does something better than the other, male or female.

Back in March, Alex Morgan and her teammates filed suit against the United States Soccer Federation claiming gender-based pay discrimination. While most employers don’t have the same visibility as a sports team, it’s still important to look into pay practices - and soon. The EEOC is set to begin collecting pay data starting in September.

S. may think the immigrants are coming here illegally but I found out that according to the Geneva Convention they have the right to immigrate?  You know there are ways to stop this.  Instead of going in and trying to get these countries to turn to democracy, raping them for their natural resources, then install a puppet head of the government, not following through with the promises we make to the puppet head of these governments all because the RETHUGLICANS are nothing but greedy ass morons and their only God is money, we need to have a multi country advisory commission to get the monster dictators out of office.  I know a lot of people won't agree with me on this.  The immigration of these desperate people are partial the  U. S. fault.  We go out and do things like Iraq.  The only thing we did wrong was George H. W. Bush didn't get Sadam Hussein in the Gulf War in 1996.  General Schwartkopt told GHWB that he needed to to get Hussein out of Iraq in 1996.  Consequently when George W. Bush became president he used the ruse of WMD to go back and finish what daddy didn't get done.  GWB made promises to generals in the Iraqi army.  ISIS came from these generals when GWB didn't keep the promises he made to them.  While I know this is no excuse for terrorism people have their limits that they can handle.  Instead of making money their God (all the greedy head of countries) they need to grow a conscious and soul.  The International community should come together and try and do something about these monster dictators like in Syria.  That was one of the things that upset me about with the rest of the international community regarding Sadam Hussein, that the only other country that was with us was England.  That France & Germany weren't with us in trying to get Satan Hussein.  France & Germany should know about what a monster was.  There should still be some people who remember WWII and what a monster Hitler.  I AM SICK OF THE STUPID, BRAIN DEAD TRDUMPSTER SUPPORTERS!!!!!!!!!!!",20

Whatever it is, we want to hear it!😃

The way to approach life is to play the hand you are dealt the best that you can.  This can include bluffing within the rules, but calling for a new deal when it was all “by the book” and others have better cards won’t fly until you win that hand.

You can & should advocate for a more fair game, but I believe that Booker T. Washington promotes & think that once you gain power, you are in a better position to make changes.

Hard work is the way to get what you want.  What that work looks like is up to you & your goals.

1275,79,"When do you refuel and recharge? 🌸🍓 It is said that one can only share with the world what one has inside. 
Oprah Winfrey is famous for saying,
“My cup runneth OVER.” 👑

You cannot dear, you cannot pour from an empty cup. So how will you refill your cup, today? 📆

As a female entrepreneur we are at high risk for over-giving and undercharging. Check out my colleague @prosperity.priestess for more on this.

This is why I have created some steps for you to ensure you are balancing your sacred service with self-care.
🌷🌸🌷🌸🌷
Check out my tips below:
.
💖 Plan ahead. - Know what you need to feel “full.” Based on knowing what works for you, have this as a go-to Self-Care Menu to refer to when you are feeling low. Continually build on this list to keep it interesting.
💖 Know the value of what you offer. - This means continually checking in with the industry rate of the services and products you offer to ensure they are fairly priced. If you price over industry rate, have substantial reason for doing so: make sure you are tracking the “invisible value” you provide and communicate that in your sales messaging. #AcknowledgeYourselfie
💖 Respond when people ask for help. Instead of helping people by default, wait until you are asked for help and then provide it only if you are able to. God places people on our path so that we can help them, and so they can help us. But we need to ask, and respond to being asked - no assumptions. * This will significantly preserve your energy reserves.
💖 Have one day a week that is sincerely and boldly for yourselfie. That means no “work” for others, invest in yourselfie, honour yourself and make the promise that by the end of the day, you’re going to feel so #Glam.

Try out these tips and let me know how it goes!! Today is my day off (Thursday’s are the entrepreneurs Saturday’s in my life ☺️🌈) I made myself a delectable omega fruit oatmeal this morning - now its time to run a crystal salt bath and read my book on the biography of Cleopatra. 
Enjoy your day lovebirds and remember to honour yourselfie, luxuriate yourselfie and treat yourselfie with loving #TLC.

According to American Association of University Women:
“Women aged 55–64 are paid 78 percent as much as men the same age, a gap more than double that of women aged 20–24. Earnings for both female and male full-time workers tend to increase with age, although they rise more slowly after age 45 and even decrease after age 55. But as workers progress in their careers, women’s median earnings grow more slowly than men’s.” https://www.aauw.org/2019/04/02/8-surprising-facts-about-the-gender-pay-gap/

👉🏻Quante volte ci sentiamo di meritare di più e di non essere valorizzate abbastanza? Ti senti anche tu rientrante in questa categoria?

Ebbene, se la risposta è si… non sei la sola!
Purtroppo infatti, solo il 7% delle donne tenta di negoziare il proprio stipendio al primo impiego, rispetto al 57% degli uomini!😱
Le donne infatti sono più timide in queste situazioni, in particolare nel chiedere un aumento (soprattutto se meritato!), un dato che viene confermato in tutte le ricerche.

Do you know what this number signifies?

39 days is how many extra days in a year that a woman would have to work to earn the same amount as a man in 2018, according to Pew Research.

It has been 55 years since the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was put into effect.

55 years.

Over half a CENTURY since this law was put into effect. Let that sink in for a minute.

During this time the pay gap has narrowed but it still hasn’t closed and if we don’t shed light on this topic it will continue to be an issue.

F**K A SEAT. LET'S ALL EAT. EQUAL PAY MATTERS.

Cast your vote to have a panel discussion at SXSW 2020 to have this discussion with women in business who are fighting the fight for equal pay every day click the link in our bio.

Whatever it is, we want to hear it!😃

It’s from feeling sick over school shootings, children in cages, and homeless populations soaring. I’m full of rage because I sit in 3 hours of traffic everyday, because despite working my ass off, I have zero job advancement in my current job. I rage because of how women are treated, because I haven’t slept in a year, and half my paycheck goes to child care. And I’m lucky. Yes, lucky. I have the means to pay for childcare, a car to get to work, and food on my table. So many moms are struggling,  and that also makes me rage. Sometimes I feel like a time bomb.

Today I received a DM from a mom saying that I should keep politics off of this page. Telling me to “stay in my lane.” While I don’t usually engage with messages like these, I could not ignore the need for this conversation. I have never felt more convinced of just how political motherhood is than right now. Our reproductive rights being threatened? Political. A healthcare system that leaves birthing people shattered, and black and brown women dying at greater rates than in the ‘80s? Political. A country that puts brown babies from other countries in cages will make excuses to put any child in cages. It’s a slippery slope. Funding for women’s health issues is still largely lacking — which is why we still are so in the dark about certain drugs, and their interactions with our breast milk and our developing fetuses. (And don’t even get me started about censorship of birthing and postpartum bodies.) Throughout history, mothers have been the backbone of political change. Our rage drives movements. We turn pain into power 👊🏽👊🏻👊🏾👊🏿. #motherhoodispolitical

I personally don't agree with liberal or conservative view points on every issue. I don't agree with abortion used as birth control, which is what it is a majority of the time, but I do think it is appropriate for rare circumstances. I don't agree with government supplied health care, because my husband is military and we have to use it, and it sucks. I'm also a nurse, so I see multiple aspects of the health care problem, and one major issue is that preventable disease (diabetes, cardiomyopathy, heart disease, etc) causes more issues than any other disease combined. We live in a world where patients want everything free, but they don't want to do the hard work to take responsibility for their own health. Our country absolutely cannot afford to provide health care to a population that refuses to be healthy. It will bankrupt us. On the other hand, I believe we should have maternity leave because it would be much more beneficial to the health and well-being of moms and babies. I think if we can all take responsibility for our own actions, and also hold the government accountable by staying informed and voting, then we can make a real difference.|2 million % yes.|Motherhood IS political.

Our government still reigns supreme and shapes even the minutiae of our lives. 
Think about a typical morning. We wake up to our alarms. We know the exact minute because the government-controlled National Institute of Standards and Technology keeps the official time.

We eat breakfast. Our eggs could be at risk for salmonella, but federal regulations have ensured that we’ll be safe after we’ve devoured our omelets.

Our kids get on the school bus and go to school—the kids who attend public school (majority of America) are supported by taxpayer dollars.

By the end of the day, we’ve walked home from school through a public park supported by the local Parks Department, watched television on publicly supported power grids, and talked on our cell phones, enabled by government wiring and technology.

What you’re doing here @notsafeformomgroup is changing the narrative. You’re creating a new normal by giving women the platform to be powerful themselves, through storysharing. Empathy is the most radical of human emotions. We need to have these powerful and persistent conversations. Democracy is messy. Change takes time.

Finally we close out our opening with some housekeeping from last week with an update on the #USWNT Wage-Gap Lawsuit and the response by the USSF President.

We discuss the new Aziz Ansari Stand-Up Special and how tremendous we thought it was, shout out Spike Jonze. We then switch gears and discuss the 9/11 Compensation Fund, making it flush until 2092, and the ignorant backlash #Trump got from Vox for a comment he made during the media conference. Staying on politics, we look into South Korea, possibly, shooting warning shots at Russian Military Plane that violated a restricted South Korean airspace. We discuss some breaking news sent in by Uncle Potts with the Capitol One data breach of more than 100 million applications and accounts. We stay serious and look into Boeing’s $2.9 Billion loss in Quarter 2 and Ford’s new prototype electric truck that towed a record 1.25 million pounds (your move Tesla). We switch gears and watch some videos of NFL stars arriving to Training Camp (they all look stupid) and A-Rod purchasing J.Lo a Porsche for her birthday even though she hasn’t drive a car in two decades.

We close the show talking about mosquitoes in Florida testing positive for antibodies to Eastern Equine Encephalitis and Tulsi Gabbard’s $50 Million Dollar lawsuit against Google claiming their bias caused her Google Campaign Ad Account to be suspended.

👉 Et toi, tu répondrais quoi à cette remarque pleine de mauvaise foi ?
.
Point Info : Oui, en France, au 21ème siècle, les femmes sont payées 9% de moins en moyenne que leurs homologues masculins, à compétences égales et travail égal. Et c’est sans compter la sous-représentation des femmes dans les postes à responsabilité, souvent plus rémunérés : ainsi, la moyenne des revenus bruts est de 24% plus élevée chez les hommes que chez les femmes (tous postes confondus). Avec ces chiffres, difficile d’affirmer que l’inégalité salariale est un mythe. D’autant plus qu’à ces discriminations de genre s’ajoutent potentiellement celles liées à l’intersectionnalité des personnes concernées (racisme, validisme, ...). Bref, on a encore du boulot vers l’égalité. Oui. Même en France, même en 2019, et c’est loin d’en être le seul exemple ✊✨.

Ce chiffre de 25/28/30% qu’on entend sont erronés , ils ne prennent pas en compte les heures de travaille mensuel ( qui diffèrent ) et ne différencie pas le temps partiel et le temps plein ( ou encore les congés maternité etc). Or les femmes dans la majorité des cas ne travaillent pas a TP toutes leurs vies de plus dans la majorité des cas ce sont les femmes qui partent plus tôt du boulot pour récupérer les enfants ( ce n’est qu’un exemple parmi tant d’autres). La ou vous dîtes la vérité et je l’admet et je le combat autant que vous c’est l’oscillation en 5 et 10 pourcent de différence de salaire . Mais bon la france est un pays méchant et sexiste alors autant dire de la merde de toute façon la vérité on s’en branle non ?|@ton_caroline|Bah en faite si s’est un mythe à poste égal s’est le même salaire coco (c’est pas légal sinon) .... la seule différence c’est que les femmes du à leur congé maternité augmente de salaire parfois plus lentement mais sinon c’est exactement pareil coco.... comme tu dis c’est tout poste confondu car effectivement les hommes et les femmes font pas tous les meme métier et que les hommes on en général des métiers qui rémunère plus et rien n’empêche à une femme d’y accéder si elle travail! ...en plus s’est contradictoire si les femmes était pour le même travail payer moins cher alors elle serait beaucoup plus favorisé à l’embauche non ? Ce qui n’est évidement pas le cas....alors oui y’a des abus bien sûr...oui les femmes sont sous représente dans les haut cadres car parfois défavorisé certe....mais aucun cas elles sont moins bien payer a poste égal et au même compétence...donc sur ce point de vue oui s’est un mythe....

Je comprend pas pourtant il y a vachement peux de femme éboueur mais personnes n'a l'air de vouloir se battre pour cela c'est sûrement un HASARD hein ? Oui les femmes sont payé donc en moyenne total 25 % moins , notamment pour des causes d'orientation (plus de femmes en spécialité littéraires ) ce qui est liée à un choix (oui désolé on a démontré que dans les pays type le moyen orient on a plus de femmes en études scientifique ce qui démontre que c'est un choix ) . Les 9 pourcents de salaires à même poste sont notamment liée au fait que en moyenne les femmes sont 4 fois moins enclines que les hommes à négocier  leurs salaires (ce qui n'est pas liée à la manière de négocier mais bien au fait d'être enclines à le faire ). Bien des personnes considère cela comme un ""mythe "" car cela ne s'explique pas par une discrimination (que l'on considère ici comme étant une généralité ) mais liée sois au raison énoncé précédemment sois à des cas particuliers .",7138
1347,151,"#Health and #income #inequalities over generations – what can be done? If you missed this blog article, here’s your chance to read it again…

Dr Heather Brown of Newcastle University writes about her research using Understanding Society data – on a year-long Understanding Society Policy Fellowship – which looks at the relationship between income and health.

She shows that particularly in the North of England, more young people are following their parents into an adult life of low wages and poor health. As part of her Fellowship, Heather has been holding workshops with policy makers, including government departments, to discuss what can be done about her findings.

One suggestion is that, even with limited resources, local authorities can take action to promote good health in families in disadvantaged communities. For example, it’s possible to use local planning laws to reduce the number of fast food outlets in particular neighbourhoods – and councils can require developers to think about green space when building new homes.

1350,154,"Discrimination in the workplace is not a parent problem, it's a mother problem. When women between ages 25 and 35 give birth and return to work, their earnings never recover compared to their male coworkers. Fathers, on the other hand, average a six percent raise for each kid they have. Eighty percent of new parents are millennials and they have been pushing back against policies that re-enforce the anti-mom bias.

Working with costumes in Hollywood has a common misconception of being glamorous.
🎞
I, along with one assistant, spent 3 days outside in 90 degree heat, taking inventory and packing 23 crates of costumes weighing 150-200 pounds per crate, for our location shoot.
💪🏻
Our team has been researching, fabric swatching, shopping, renting, and doing fittings for 3 months now and this is only our FIRST round of shipments. AND, these are just the costumes for the extras to be used for a single major scene.
🎬
The wage gap between the costume department and the rest of the film crew departments displays how misunderstood, under valued, and gender biased our labor is, since a majority of costume departments are female driven. PAY EQUITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Let’s face it, we are all addicted to our phones. Some of us have jobs where our phones are required to be locked up in a locker for the day and we only have access to them on breaks. As a desk worker – who does not have to lock up her phone – I can only imagine the agony! .
Time spent on a personal device can interfere with work and productivity. Ever fall into an Instagram trance and next thing you know 2 hours have passed? Sure, you haven’t…
.
Personal devices and the persistent distractions of the digital era can be a problem for employers. In certain workplaces, distraction by a digital device can be dangerous or bad for customer relations. I’m sure we’ve all been kept waiting at some point by an employee who was giggling into their phone instead of helping us. .
So, what can employers do?

IWPR tracks the gender wage gap over time in a series of fact sheets updated twice per year. According to our research, if change continues at the same slow pace as it has done for the past fifty years, it will take 40 years—or until 2059—for women to finally reach pay parity. For women of color, the rate of change is even slower:

Hispanic women will have to wait until 2224 and Black women will wait until 2119 for equal pay.

Yes, it was originally about protecting women and getting fair treatment for women but it's changed. Women are still treated unfairly, but along with feminism protecting women and working to have women get treated fairly and not harassed, it tries to protect every person who's not.

Injustice is something that had always made me uncomfortable when I was younger, and to this day, seeing people treated unfairly just makes my blood boil, misandry is a real problem. Toxic masculinity is a real problem. Men have to deal with horrible and stressful everyday stigmas that build up and take a huge toll on their mental health. I know this account is oriented towards women's problems, and that's a good thing, but men need people to speak out for them too, I've seen these stigmas firsthand and I'm sick of being the only one that has ever stood up against them in my life offline. Misandry needs more awareness and you will not be able to convince me otherwise ~Alex 🌺💙

Many things in this post have no point and I recommend using some data.|they don’t lack any reproductive rights though?? correct me if i am wrong please|“Misandry” is not a thing. While i one hundred percent agree that men’s issues are ignored and need to be more focused on most if not all of these stereotypes are perpetuated by the patriarchy. Example: its men calling other men “gay” or “pussy” for showing emotions. Its other men telling male rape victims they should have enjoyed it. Its men who have always viewed women as the inferior sex incapable of violence or abuse. This doesnt mean that a man is responsible for their own assault or degradation but its important to know where this all comes from. Misandry implies women oppressing men but women are not in a social position to do so and have never been. Just like how racism against white people doesnt exist because they are in the position of the oppressors and not the oppressed. As women we still lack social privileges in first world countries and its even worse around the world. Men’s rights are an issue yes. But most of these in these post stem from toxic masculinity and I wont sugarcoat my feminism so that men dont feel threatened enough to blame their societal struggles on women|Imagine being so ignorant that you think men can’t raped, sexually harassed or be in a mentally/physically/emotionally abusive relationship.

Are all women making gains in the American workplace compared to previous generations? The short answer: no. Gains for women of color haven’t been nearly as significant as those for white women. According to McKinsey, white women hold only 19% of C-Suite positions, while women of color only hold 4% of them. Diversity and inclusion efforts, too, often leave out the unique experiences of women of color. There are several things your company can do to help:
.
1) Disaggregate pay data by gender and race. A wide body of research shows women of color experience higher pay gaps than white women.
.
2) Analyze employee engagement surveys by race and gender. Women of color in most organizations remain underrepresented and marginalized — often held back by pervasive stereotypes.
.
3) Commit to funding and supporting employee resource groups, particularly affinity groups for black employees. When you address the most marginalized communities in the organization, you have a better shot at creating an inclusive environment.
.
4) Only embark on implicit bias or diversity training that takes an intersectional approach. Interventions that help white women to succeed, like “Lean In,” are often counter-productive for women of color.

1) right wing isn't bad. How do I know? Well I could say the exact same thing as you did, watch: Los actually kinda bad to be left wing. The basis of left wing ideology is supporting world war three (a nuclear war that would destroy the planet) supporting the shutting down of men's abuse shelters and men's marches, beating up and verbally assaulting white people for being white, hurting cops for doing their jobs (of course you'll refute that because ""b-b-buh ACAB!1!"")supporting known and labelled terrorist groups who assault and give brain damage to gay Asian reporters because antifa hate gays and Asians (prove me fucking wrong) -

2) 40% of cops being domestic abusers (again no source) doesn't mean all cops are domestic abusers or bad. Every. Single, group ever has bad members in it, feminists, Buddhists, the allies during ww1&2 EVERY GROUP. So you can't judge one group based on a few bad eggs (an argument I'm sure you've used for gays)
Think of it is this way: I've had many bad encounters with gay activists, does that make it right for me to say all gays are faggots? NO. -
Hey nice stupid editing at the end. No sources of course.

1409,213,"Working with costumes in Hollywood has a common misconception of being glamorous.
🎞
I, along with one assistant, spent 3 days outside in 90 degree heat, taking inventory and packing 23 crates of costumes weighing 150-200 pounds per crate, for our location shoot.
💪🏻
Our team has been researching, fabric swatching, shopping, renting, and doing fittings for 3 months now and this is only our FIRST round of shipments. AND, these are just the costumes for the extras to be used for a single major scene.
🎬
The wage gap between the costume department and the rest of the film crew departments displays how misunderstood, under valued, and gender biased our labor is, since a majority of costume departments are female driven. PAY EQUITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.

1) and nowhere in your post did you ever specify what types of people Antifa go after aside from ""fascists."" Fascists such as who? You only mentioned the right wing. There's also the fact that antifa have been know to repeatedly attack anyone right wing. Case in point? Andy Cho

2) they do. They beat anyone, they beat old men with crowbars, they beat right wing journalists they beat anyone right wing because they're all insane fucks who think the right wing are all fascists.

3)all that stuff is still illegal. It's not illegal to have facist ideals, it is however illegal to doxx people. I think one thing I've forgotten to mention is that this entire time you've been advocating for crime against people who really only have controversial opinions and beliefs.

1415,219,"Quick tips for new freelancers & consultants⏱I got played TWICE in 2016 so you don’t have to 🤦🏾‍♀️! Here’s what I learned....1️⃣ Set your rate at a price point that reflects your expertise. Don’t be afraid to go high and ask your friends/colleagues what they charge. Your rate needs to be high enough that you can be choosy with your clientele, and won’t be forced to take on every project! I have an hourly rate and a flexible rate for longer projects. It’s very awkward to ask people what they make, that’s true. You know what’s worse? Finding out that you get paid less than everyone else. 2️⃣ Take detailed notes during initial client meetings and immediately follow up with an email that says “As we discussed…”, so that there is a record of what you talked about and what they want. A conversation is NOT a contract, you need RECEIPTS. 3️⃣ Set the payment terms upfront. Aim for the least amount of turnaround time as possible. Let your client know that they will be invoiced bi-weekly/monthly, etc. If they don’t pay within a 30 day window of the date, I suspend my services until the invoice is fulfilled. 4️⃣ DO NOT let anyone “pick your brain”. If someone asks to do this, I send a polite reply and let them know that I am happy to meet and include my hourly rate. Brain picking IS consulting. The exception to this is my actual friends, I love helping my friends 💕 I let so many companies/consultants do this to me early on and saw MY ideas go to market with no credit at all 5️⃣ Demonstrate your value to your clients with an initial meeting, but don’t go too far into specifics. I have made this mistake and tried to “oversell” myself in the early days, only for companies to implement my ideas themselves-UGH, my bad 6️⃣ Start with a short term contract. I usually start with a 6-week or 15 hour engagement to make sure that the relationship with the client is smooth and productive, that way I am not locked into anything tedious or problematic. I always have an option to renew 👍🏾 These are my quick tips, let me know if you would like the full version!  Managing my time/money this way allows me to volunteer & donate more.

She takes the time off rather than her husband when their child is sick or sometimes another family member helps.  She was also getting pressure from her team members because of this.

Not saying it’s right or wrong, just what it is and I do think it’s changing as men are becoming more involved fathers. But this results in women choosing to Out their family first more often than men (leave the office promptly at 5pm, slip the shmoozing at the Friday happy hour) because they just don’t care as much as men typically do about that stuff.

In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don’t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn’t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week.
Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is “choice.” The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap “may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.” Well, let’s look at some of those choices.",14

I personally don't know the formula but the calculation is possible because it existed here in Argentina and other countries. It is readjusted by inflation every year so that the money you earn will be valuable year after year. it is not impossible. however the side effects are huge. for example no one wants to come and put a factory or produce anything in Argentina bc livable wage means high labour costs, which lowers investment in our country and ultimately fucks our economy up. idk personally what to think about livable wage, but I do know that the calculation is possible bc it exists in my country and many other countries|Your issue with minimum wage is that stuff is complicated?

1457,261,"An essential point in the feminist argument is the wage gap which states that men earn more than women and this is mostly due to sexism where men are paid more because they’re men. This has been debunked numerous times by female scholars and Male scholars the same, While a gap is seen in the data, the data only shows total earnings of men and compares it the the total earnings of women as a whole. What this fails to mention is that more men work than women, more men have higher paid jobs than women, many women choose not to work (not saying that women can’t work only saying that some choose not to) if the study were to compare both genders in one line of work where they all have the same role it would be evident that the wage gap is not due to sexism...as this is a crime and by you saying that this exists would also be you saying that most companies are braking laws.

Most men work more high-paying jobs as opposed to women.  Since women are primarily working part-time jobs or merely being a stay-at-home mother.

And we sure do! Not just because of all the natural beauty, but Utah has become one of the fastest growing states in the country. 
What does this mean for women? For one, Utah has more than 80’000 women-run businesses that generate roughly $14 billion in revenue. We also rank higher than the national average for growth in women-owned businesses. 
But, there’s work to be done! Only 37% of women are employed in managerial occupations, which makes UT 46th out of 50 in the nation. Also, women earn 70 cents for every dollar a man makes, putting us dead last in the nation. 
UT has a bright future, but it can be even brighter if we make sure there’s growth and opportunity for women when it comes to pay, access to funding, and career development. (Stats from @braidworkshop, @wbcutah, and @sltrib)
