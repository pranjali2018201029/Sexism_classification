4,4,"“I promise to make my personal growth my first priority”. — That was our very first, and most important, wedding vow we said to each other.

Here’s why this matters:

You can’t be in a good relationship if you’re a jerk. 😂

Seriously though, if you’re immature, wounded, mean, unwilling to change—every relationship you have will suck.

REAL relationships require you to be your best. (Read that twice). They require you to learn, grow, and yes—change. And those things are uncomfortable sometimes.

Heck they’re even scary.

BUT—its what is needed for a relationship that grows together.

And here’s the kicker:
You are only responsible for YOUR growth.

In other words, you can’t make your partner grow and they can’t make you grow. It’s SELF initiated and SELF responsibility.

And that’s also hard. One of the questions we get so often is: “How do I make my partner...?” Here’s the answer:
YOU DON’T.
If you’re wanting your partner to change, that’s a big flag that YOU have got some shifting to do also. The best way to “get them” to change is to be the example. Lead by your own growth and strive for learning.

Whew. What do YOU think? Have you been in these types of situations before? Tell us about it below:",questionsformen,"|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

5,5,"Hey guys, Jake here and I’ve heard that women have some questions for men that they’d like to ask. 🤨 so... I wrote a blog post answering the most common questions they have for men.

Keep in mind: I’m not speaking on behalf of all male or male identifying folks. I’m speaking from my gut and spilling the beans from my perspective in hopes that this post will spark some courage for you to ask the men in your life these questions too.

It’s my hope that this sparks the conversations that you should be having in your relationship. Feel free to start the ball rolling. “Frequently Asked Questions for Men. (All the stuff you’d want to know!) 1) Seriously, what ARE you thinking about when I ask you? Is it really nothing?

Honestly, nothing. I’m either zoned out or my mind is blank. Sometimes it could be random thoughts depending on where I am, what time of the day it is or if I’m hungry but most of the time it’s actually nothing.

2) What do you actually talk about with your friends?” Peep the full article up at the link in our bio! 👆🏾👆🏼 Do you have a burning question I didn’t get to? Leave it below! 👇🏼👇🏾 I’m all yours!",questionsformen,"|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

16,16,"They ask me why I'm radical, ""hardcore"", feel so strongly about feminism. 
THIS is why.

I wasn't always radical. 
I've been a feminist, long before I knew the word. But I wasn't always radical. 
I tolerated sexist jokes (just a joke, no biggie), unsavoury sexist comments; sexism at work and in college; watched stuff with obvious sexism in it; sexist mentality was excused as ""s/he's old""; I excused mild sexual harassment as ""that's just him"" etc. 
Today I have a zero tolerance policy. 
Today I realise radical feminist is the only way to be and the only way feminist I want to be. 
Today I am a feminist who strives hard to be anti-sexist. 
Today I work hard to fight sexism, both, the one inculcated in me and the one ingrained in my culture around me.

But seriously, no one wants a key to the face lol|@slimshani Lol, all's good. Keys in the eye would huuuuurt!|Two main points I wish to make, here. The first is that while I don't specifically hold on to my keys, at night I often pull my hood over and walk hunched over so as to seem intimidating and avoid assault. The second is that your fears are not entirely grounded in reality, and I hope I can alleviate that fear by pointing this out. The truth is that while women are on average more likely to be a victim of sexual assault or abduction than men, men surpass women's likelihood to be a victim in homicide, robbery, aggravated assault and most other major crimes. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed data which showed that 78.7% of homicide victims are male. I would gladly send you more data and study if you remain unconvinced of your relative safety to men.|1- I walk home with my keys in my fingers so I can open the door. 2- I don't look over my shoulder because I'm not paranoid|Good for you.|@c0bbylw quick question: when you hunch your shoulders and pull your hood up to appear intimidating and avoid assault, who do you imagine as your assaulter? A group of women, armed with guns and bats? Or a man, or men, ready to be aggressive with you for your wallet? You are fearing men in the same way that women are, yet you say that you avoid assault as if that makes you different than us. As for the fear not being grounded in reality, that's simply innacurate. Keep in mind that we are not talking about RELATIVE safety. We are calling attention to an issue of safety that one in three women deal with. Don't belittle someone's concern,  we need to recognize the issue and stop trying to derail the conversation.|@haleyaleina I don't find it helpful to imagine how my attackers appear because if I have a mental image, I probably won't consider other potential attackers. I am not implying that my avoiding assault makes me different, I don't think my previous comment suggests that at all. I assume the 1/3 number you quote is the myth that 1 in 3 women are raped on university campuses, a statistic that included drunk consensual sex and stalking in the final number. Not the most accurate study. I am not trying to belittle anyone's concern, I am trying to show how these perceived threats don't have to control and dominate someone's view of the world, and I can show that through data. Your derailing comment seems out of place, we've both done our best to remain civil, here.|@haleyaleina A final fundamental issue with your line of thinking is that it also promotes racist views off the data you listen to. While it is true that the majority of perpetrators of rape and other physical assaults are men, a disproportionate percentage of that group are of non-white ethnicities. If you were afraid of men because they are majority perpetrators, you should be afraid of Hispanic or black men even more, by your philosophy on crime and safety. Have you overlooked this, or have we found where your morality ends?|@c0bbylw 1 in 3 women experience violence, according to the world health organization. Also, I can't tell what you're arguing in terms of race, because your argument seems to be: so in addition to being afraid of all men, I should be afraid of some men. You should also keep in mind that our legal/prison system was originally engineered to hold mass amounts of minorities, and that reporting rates for ALL crimes are higher in favor of minorities. How dare you accuse me of promoting racism when in reality, you're trying to draw lines between THOSE men and THESE men in an attempt to distance yourself and your peers from the issue? The issue is rape. Women aren't raping themselves, as it happens.|@haleyaleina My argument is that you cite data to justify your fears, however you evidently consistently don't use it to determine how to act, instead you find data to back up your preexisting assumptions, case in point: how you will be afraid of men because of data, however when more detailed study is done you ignore it. You are willing to find single numbers to support your view, however when more data is revealed you distance yourself from the facts. This is the definition of confirmation bias. Further study of the numbers shows that the perpetrators are overwhelmingly people the victim knows, however you still keep friends and family nearby, or how the majority of this abuse is documented to occur in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and the Middle East (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/), yet the majority of criticisms you have are towards western culture, the culture most accomodating and supportive of women by far. However improbable the chance there is any, I ask that you send studies to support your claim about the prison system. And actually women DO rape. (http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=23456). Women are not exempt from evil.|@c0bbylw 1. I didn't say women didn't rape- I said that women aren't raping themselves. That is in reference (and agreement) to the statistic you mentioned earlier, that most women in sexual assault cases are victims of men. It is well known that women are humans capable of great evil. 2. There is no such thing as drunk consensual sex. Just sayin'. 3. You're simultaneously stating that women are in danger of rape (1 in 6) and that we shouldn't be afraid of rape. Okay, I know this is a lot, and both of us want to be right and stand up for our beliefs, but when you go on a post that's designed to raise awareness for women's issues and you use rape statistics to try and illustrate that it's not an issue, you might need to take a step back and wonder wht you felt so compelled to defend rape culture.|@haleyaleina I misunderstood your comment about women raping, my bad there. How can you say there is no such thing as drunk consensual sex? If all parties are intoxicated to any degree and both surely agree to the act, why do you care what people do in their own agency and privacy?  Not saying that you shouldn't be afraid of rape or assault, I'm saying that women are no more justified in their fear than men. Men face slightly different yet equivalent threats, and to suggest that women deserve special treatment would only further accentuate disparities in treatment of men and women. This original post suggests that women face some greater invisible evil that men don't even have to think about, which is just not true. Not only have you failed to support your statement about the prison system, you are also making more claims about a rape culture. Are you suggesting that Western society specifically supports rape, or global cultures in general? Please show me the studies that are supporting your views.|Consent implies a decision made with awareness of possible consequences, and alcohol inhibits judgment, leading to grey areas of consent. I mean thus particularly in cases where one is unable to vocalize their dissent due to intoxication. And women don't want special treatment- we want equal rights and a level playing field. That cannot happen if we are being victimized at twice the rate of our male peers. Are you a feminist? @c0bbylw|@c0bbylw and also, you can't refuse to do research that I've recommended and then blame it on me not supporting my facts. The info is there whenever you're ready for it :)|@haleyaleina Name the rights that men have that women don't have. Detail how the playing field is uneven. Because I can. I can tell you how men are three to four times more likely than women to commit suicide in the western world (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367275/). I can tell you how men suffer 63% longer jail sentences than women for equivalent crimes (https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx). I could tell you how men are 9 to 11 times more likely to die in the workplace (http://www.smh.com.au/comment/how-to-die-at-work-be-male-20141028-11cti8.html). I have provided clear evidence for my case, while you still have yet to support your claims about rape culture and minority-persecuting prison systems. I (by definition) am a feminist, but the term associates me with the modern third-wave movement, which I disagree with almost universally. I prefer 'egalitarian'.|Well, we have an ongoing debate about reproductive rights and the availability of health care. Then we have the wage disparity, and the disproportionate amount of females in positions of power to men. Also, about 97% of rapes go unreported because the legal system discourages the reporting and conviction of rape. Then we have worldwide female genital mutilation. Child marriages. Acid attacks. Rape being  classified as a war crime. You're asking me to prove the very fabric of our history. Women have been classified as less than men for all of time. Can we change That?|@c0bbylw why do you prefer egalitarian? What does that mean to you? All I'm trying to show you is that instead of confronting this issue on an image you see on the internet, you can and should go out into your world and communicate with women about your views on their issues. I've already given you resources to check out the racial profiling in prison systems. And the rape culture claims are supported by the fact that a picture about women's issues has turned into a debate on whether the subject of women's issues is valid or not.|@haleyaleina Reproductive rights apply asymmetrically due to biological differences, however there is valid reason for debate there. The wage disparity (I assume you reference the ""75 cents to a mans dollar"" idea) is a major misrepresentation of data. Women earn less, true, however this is not synonymous with ARE PAID less.|@haleyaleina Women on average take lower paying jobs than men, shown by how 70% of employment in education and social work is female, while most STEM fields and hard labour are around 80% men. Also, that figure did not account for working over-hours and maternity leave. How are you sure that 97% of rapes are unreported if they're not reported? Where are your sources?|@haleyaleina Who is telling you that rape reporting is discouraged? Genital mutilation and acid attacks are considered horrific crimes regardless of gender (also in the Middle East and some parts of Asia and Africa are most commonly committed by women to other women). This is a cultural issue and I agree it needs to be fixed, but that is a social community issue in particularly undeveloped nations.|@haleyaleina Countries like Saudi Arabia are the worst for this kind of thing, so why are you criticising western society for the genuine human issues overseas? These are crimes against human and civil rights and should be treated accordingly, and the western world universally defends human and civil rights.|@haleyaleina Rape being classified as a war crime is PROOF that establishments as high as the UN recognise how bad these crimes are. True, women have been marginalised for much of history, but we are not living in medieval patriarchies anymore. I distance myself from the feminist movement for this exact reason, it constantly attacks mildly offensive jokes, objectification, and 'microaggressions' while ignoring the actual human rights abuses prevalent across the world.|@haleyaleina You seem to suggest that a 2-person debate is evidence of society oppressing women by ignoring rape accusations and silencing dissent. Why? By commenting here specifically, I have had more exposure of my ideas than anywhere else. No thee medium could let me challenge ideas so globally instead of just local people. This is what I love the internet for.|It's very interesting that you're acknowledging horrible crimes done to the human race, but you have so much trouble admitting there's an issue with violence against women! Tell me, when you hear of women being mistreated, why is your first response to say, 'It's not a big deal, men get mistreated too!' Your suffering is valid. My suffering is valid. My friend, feminism is a global movement. Why are you trying to separate women's issues in America from women's issues internationally? Can we agree that women are targeted? Can we agree that historically women have been oppressed? Can we agree that as logic would follow, women are now at a disadvantageous position in relation to men?|@c0bbylw and please do some research on rape statistics! Look up how many people are convicted vs. how many people are assaulted.|@haleyaleina You are incorrectly assuming my response to violence. My issue is that it is bad enough for it to be a human or civil rights violation, combatting violence in a gender-specific way is irrelevant. Feminism in America is fundamentally different than other international issues due to the cultures of the areas in question. American and western feminists most commonly write Wall Street Journal articles or Tumblr posts about petty social issues like microaggressions and objectification of women, because western culture leaves feminists with so little to hold on to. Feminism is desperately NEEDED in countries like Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia because violence there is so ingrained in the society that it affects government. Saudi Arabia is run under Sharia law, the laws laid out by the Quran on government of people, including genital mutilation of women and persecution of gays. THAT is where women are targeted and THAT is where feminism is needed. Feminism has done its job in the western world, and needs to fade. You seem fixed on generalised, vague ideas like ""women are targeted"" without referring to any legitimate sources. You tell me that more women than men are raped, and apparently you draw from this alone that women are an oppressed 50% of the global population, yet I have shown you that men receive longer jail sentences, are more likely to commit suicide, and are four times less likely to report rape against themselves (https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence). I have shown you mountains of data, while the closest you've gotten is telling me to google rape statistics, when you clearly have stopped after two articles that support your pre-existing ideas. You are not proving anything you're saying. I can show you multiple sources for every claim I have made. Can you say the same? Who is telling you the things you believe? Who are you trusting? What studies or statistics are you basing your beliefs on? You are not showing me anything substantial. How can you expect me to believe you if you don't show me the data?|@c0bbylw it's not my responsibility to go do research for you, but I'm happy to point you in the right direction! What you need to recognize is that your statistics are all based in one way or another on the existing power imbalance between men and women, where men have more and women have less power. Your statistics prove my point, of the need for modern feminism. I suggest maybe getting off the internet and asking some women face to face about feminism. Get the dialogue started with your mom, or sister, or friend. You're belittling the stories you're reading on Tumblr from modern American women because it doesn't fit YOUR idea of feminism, but a girl being raped here in America will have the same heartache as a girl in Ethiopia, so let's try to make all women safe. Get the idea? Seriously, go talk to some ladies and ask if the tampon tax is fair, or if they are represented as a group in politics, or if they've ever been told 'girls don't do that'. But take them seriously! Inspect your beliefs about why you're against women standing up for themselves and demanding a safer life for us and future generations.|@haleyaleina Here we are, at the limits of your beliefs. The only way that your ideology can survive is if I abandon skepticism and research, and embrace biased anecdotal evidence as valid data. You would rather believe that there is a global conspiracy putting down women and faking data, than entertain the possibility that you are wrong or misinformed. This is either your incredible inexperience at debating, or intellectual dishonesty. You have categorically failed to prove ANY of your statements, while avoiding refuting mine honestly. In order for anything to be learned from this, I need to know where you are sourcing this information, or who is telling you it, because more and more I get the feeling you are exaggerating or simply fabricating your own 'facts' to keep your thought bubble intact, and without external sources, that is the most likely explanation. You have never inspected your own beliefs on this subject, and cannot do so, because if you think too hard about this you will have to admit you are lying. This is where feminism has left being a movement and morphed into a full ideology. If you want to be taken seriously, refute my points one by one, and clearly support your own with evidence. Debaters like you represent modern feminism, and why feminism is not taken seriously, by me or anyone reasonable.",29

Letting people know that you are ok is a good way to let them know when you're not.|@miaronnebo I do feel the need to point out your sexism in your above comment. I understand that objectively and statistically men are the most likely to commit crimes, however also statistically it is the most likely for MEN to be the victims of these crimes. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed data which showed that worldwide 78.7% of homicide victims are male. I will gladly send you more data if you remain unconvinced. Your lack of research into this area has led you to being afraid of 3.6 billion people, most of which you have never met (probably) and know very little about. Also, you reference the patriarchy, however I have seen very little to support such an institutionalized and systemic form of sexism. Verifiable evidence is welcome.|So its sexism to point out that men is the group that commits most violent acts including rape? @c0bby407|@miaronnebo It is not sexist to point out facts, however it is ignorant to only look for part of the data. The more complete story is that men are the most likely victims of these crimes as well, as I highlighted in my previous comment. Your feelings of fear at night may be warranted, however you are no different from other men in similar situations. Men don't just stroll down the street without a care in the world if they're smart.|@c0bby407  its not very likely for men to get raped or sexually harrassed. The problem is still that women are afraid of men because MEN are the ones statistically that perform these acts. It does not take away facts that men can also be afraid. But this is not what we are discussing at the moment. What you are doing is to hijack this topic to be about men instead of talking about how we can get rid of the problem. Its not helpful or constructive at all. Why dont you start you own feminist account to talk to other guys about toxic masculinity instead? And what you can do about it?|@miaronnebo I believe that it is important to understand that we are not discussing a closed system and a single issue. We both know it is far more complicated than that, and it cannot be effectively discussed without involving other areas or topics. It is true that women are the most likely victims of rape and sexual assault, however men are most likely to be victims of murder of all degrees, robbery and larceny, grand theft auto, identity theft, and a myriad of other life-destroying crimes. The original post was questioning if men have to message when they get home to let others know they were safe, using rhetoric to suggest that this isn't an issue men face. I am attempting to show that everyone is in danger and women are not some unique victimized group.|And how many of your male friends text you or each other ? Its the feeling as well. Im still pretty sure most guys dont do this because they dont feel uncomfy getting into a cab alone with a male driver or riding the subway or bus alone because they are scared that other guy on the bus will harass them.|@c0bby407|@miaronnebo This is exactly what I am attempting to make clear. This 'feeling' of being threatened is no more warranted than that of men, and the data shows this. I could tell you about the time one of my male friends was groped by a man, or about when my parents set a curfew of 9 pm because the streets get way too dangerous at night, but these are baseless arguments, anecdotes which could have easily been fabricated or modified. Arguments must be justified and proven, something that your arguments appear to be lacking. I suggest you talk to your close male friends about their experiences. You may be surprised. Please do not base arguments on ""pretty sure"" and ""feelings"".|@c0bby407 i dont know where you live, but here in Sweden according to swedish statistics, 6% of men worry about being attacked compared to 16% of women. 25% of the women also feel unsafe in the area where they live compared to 7% of the men. Every 10th woman avoid going out alone at night in her own neighbourhood. Womens fears are connected to being sexually assaulted. This is the big difference. You can tell me about your one friend being groped by another guy, i can tell you ALL the women that I know, including myself has bern sexually harassed, physycally, verbally or actually raped. Sexual harassment is something a lot of girls and women experience many times, so, dont dare tell me that we shouldnt be afraid or that men are equally afraid bc its simply not true.|@miaronnebo You are making progress with using statistics, however you are still missing my point. It is clear women are on average more afraid, however what the statistics I presented show is that women have no more REASON to be afraid than men, whether they actually are or not. Perceived threats are not the same as actual threats. And as I warned, you have turned to anecdotal evidence to prove your point, after I just clearly demonstrated how useless that form of justification is.|So what? Women are afraid of reasons. Men are that reason. If men stopped being assholes, we wouldnt need to be afraid. So go cry somewhere else. This is extremtely tiring. Spend your time talking to sexist men instead.|@c0bby407|@miaronnebo I find it extremely counterproductive to call 3.5 billion people assholes without even meeting them. If I were to make a statement about women being assholes, I'm sure we both can imagine your response. Do you not see the double standard you have just created? You are failing to actually listen to my point, and instead are insulting men for no apparent reason. I am begging you not to sacrifice reason and logic for emotional reaction and sexism.|Ok, let me explain. You are trying to say ""not all men"" but with more words. Its not that we think that ALL MEN are assholes. We know they are not. We are talking about the GROUP ""men"". Because we know this group is more likely to commit violent acts, sexual harassment etc. The thing is we have no clue about who if all these men to be afraid of, therefor the logical feeling of being afraid of the GROUP men. You see? I will stop debating this bc you are wasting my time. I suggest you read up on gender studies and feminism and try not to waste womens time trying to tell us what to feel and not. Go bother men instead, they are the problem. Not women. Bye. @c0bby407|@miaronnebo I have disagreed with most of feminism, but one part which always held my respect was the fact that feminism was in part about identifying people as more than their gender. Sure, they fit into groups and subdivisions, but feminism was about realizing that we are all so much more than that, we were our own characters and identities made up of hundreds of experiences and ideologies. The moment you construct this false dichotomy of men vs women or billions against billions you are refusing to acknowledge that everyone is an individual and more than their gender, completely undermining what little sense modern feminism made. You are sacrificing accurate, detailed and complex points for a cheap, short slogan. ""Men are the problem, not women"" is the pinnacle of your failure to understand the complexity and depth of the issue we are discussing, while at the same time dividing these unique and integrated people into two final categories regardless of who they may truly be.|Exactly. We are not our gender. Gender is not an identity. We create gender. Both men and women are responsible for that. Everybody looses in this system that we call patriarchy but men win a little bit more on behalf of women. Over and out. @c0bby407 i suggest you read feminist books and not just headlines.|@miaronnebo You just agreed with me and then showed you learned nothing, immediately doing the exact same thing again by dividing society into men and women. This is called a false dichotomy, creating two separate and opposed groups and then clashing them against each other in some oversimplified dramatic statement about the world. Also, I have yet to see proof of the patriarchy hypothesis so many feminists reference, so I would be very grateful for an argument in favor of its existence in the Western world. To not reply would be to forfeit your position.|Its not me who decided that. Society decided that we divide the world like that. Society taught us that men and women are each others opposites, whics is ofc made up. @c0bby407|Im blocking you now. Pls read a couple of books about intersectional feminism and feminist theory. @c0bby407|It is not our job to educate men why we fear them. Ask amongst yourself or google it and LISTEN. To the people telling their truths.  Be humble. Be kind. Or be banned. No more spoons for you.",26
