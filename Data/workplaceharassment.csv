You could loose your position while delivering stellar results in the workplace.

22,"This year’s theme for World Mental Health Day is suicide prevention. We are encouraging you to prepare to take “40 seconds of action” today by focusing on the following:
- Raise awareness in your workplace of the significance of suicide
- Educate your employees on what can be done to prevent suicide
- Reduce the stigma associated with suicide
- Let anyone who is struggling know that they are not alone
- If you have EAP remind people it is there if they need it - Tell your people they are appreciated, a small gesture can go a long way!

Every 40 seconds a life is lost to suicide. Take 40 seconds out of your day today to do something about it and prevent suicide in your organisation.",workplaceharassment,|#suicide #suicideprevention #preventsuicide #corporatewellness #bullying #bullyingawareness #workplacebullying #workplaceharassment #keynote #keynotes #keynotespeaker #keynotespeakers #guestspeaker #guestspeakers #speakerscircle #professionalspeaker #corporatewellnesscoach #businessevents #corporateevent #corporatevents #corporatewellbeing #melbourneevents #perthevents #workplacewellbeing #publicspeaker #publicspeakers #workplaceculture #endbullying #businessculture #worldmentalhealthday,4

35,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the responses I get to posts where I out Indian men (it is ALWAYS Indian men) who send me inappropriate remarks.
I am always heartened to see that there are other Indian men who shake their heads at the bad behaviour and very kindly apologise for their race/gender even though I don’t feel they need to. When these nice men apologise though, you’re likely to see another Indian man chime in and ask his brother not to let down the clan🙄
So there are good apples out there, of course. I know that simply by merit of being married to Sashe.
But there are also men who DM me to whisper congratulatory words on my ‘strength’ and ‘confidence’. I don’t reply. I refuse to accept platitudes for having to fight creeps; I don’t do this because I have superhuman abilities, I do it because I am driven to act by the bad behaviour of others.
Which is why the comments that come in from women, gladden and sadden me at the same time.
For every instance of taking down a creep, millions of other interactions in cyberspace and the real world occur. 
We are subject to harassment and entitlement and bad behaviour so often, that when the naming and shaming happens, we cheer then sigh at the prevalence.
Because it happens every damned day to every other woman out there.
If there is anything that gets me down, it’s the enormity of the problem.
But I’m not going to stop naming and shaming.
Because I understand if you cannot, or cannot yet speak up. I am happy and willing to do this for you, but I need for you to consider that one day, you too must speak up.
You don’t have to agree to an injustice.
You don’t have to laugh along to a sexist joke.
You don’t have to accept that men will be men.
And you most certainly do not have to ignore unwelcomed attention.
If you don’t like something that is being said to you, you can tell the other person, firmly, that you do not like their behaviour.
What they choose to do at that point, will indicate to you what they are worth.
I’m sorry if YOU are hurt or if YOU are offended are NOT apologies.
I’m sorry I behaved badly or if I was an idiot IS an apology.

39,"🚫 SEXUAL HARASSMENT🚫

It is real, it is unwelcomed and it is unfortunately happening as I type this message. There are two types of sexual harassment in the workplace. The first is Quid Pro Quo. What is “Quid Pro Quo harassment”? This is when the harasser is in a position of authority and uses his/her power to seek sexual favors for benefits, such as: promotions, pay raises, favorable schedule, etc. 🛑Examples: - Your boss asks you to have sex with him/her in exchange for a higher pay rate💰
- Your supervisor fires, demotes or disciplines you for ending your romantic relationship with him/her📈

The second type is hostile work environment. This type of sexual harassment occurs when there are severe and pervasive unwanted sexual comments, requests, demands, etc. This can come from a coworker or supervisor. ❌Examples: - Frequent sexual jokes - Displays of inappropriate sexual material
- Persistent and unwanted communications “Let’s go on a date” - Constant sexual/inappropriate text messages or emails, which could also include emojis such as: 😘😈😏👉🏼👌🏼💋👅💦 🍆 🍑 
Sexual harassment can happen to anyone.  You are NOT a sexual object.Derek Smith Law Group, PLLC is here to help you. ▪️Give us a call ▪️📲(305) 946-1884

Eyes, eyes, eyes. Lets talk about what it takes to be a stripper. Outside of nerve—which is undeniably a requirement. The other huge part of our job is usually educating customers that their role is to pay us. Strippers are hired as independent contractors in Oregon and we work for tips. As in, there is no salary for our profession. ~
~
~
~
When we aren’t tipped we often go home with less money than we had since clubs require us to pay a fee to dance each shift. After tipping out the bar, the dj, security, and paying our house fees we still have to explain to most customers that STARING IS STEALING. ~
~
While we swim in algorithms that halt our mobility within the public sphere there are people who directly profit from sex worker motifs and culture. Simply put if you watch porn, follow sex workers online, or go to a strip club PAY UP. TIP US OUR WAGES. Otherwise, Ill just loudly clap my heels on stage till the phantom echos of death wash over you with every insistent crack of my 8 inch stilettos 😌✨💝

The Sexual Harassment of Woman at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has several compliance obligations.
One of them is the submission of annual reports.
The Act under section 21 mandates that in each calendar year the Internal Complaints Committee has to prepare an annual report and then submit the same to the employer and the district officer.
The employer has to include in this annual report the number of cases filed if any, and their disposal under this ACT.

Me NOT accepting his unwanted attention is problematic.

82,"After a traumatizing year dealing with three different types of harassment in the workforce, I learned to not shy away from reporting such incidents. Don’t be like me and learn it the hard way; now I regret not reporting the first incident immediately. I learned to speak up and stand up for myself more than ever after that. Mental health and self care is extremely important for your body, mind, and soul. Also, do not let the mental illness stigma keep you away from seeking help. You’re not alone. 
HEALING IS NOT LINEAR. I’m here for You ❤️ I may not have all the answers but I do know I have a lot of love to give. Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind, it’s the least you can do. 
If you know me, you know damn well that I’m an extroverted introvert. I’ll either talk your ears off like I’ve done 5 lines of coke, taken 60 mg of Adderall, and drank 3 cups of (boba milk) tea OR I’ll be a Buddhist monk vow of silence mute— there is no in between. I’m starting by using my little voice.

92,"What Makes a Work Environment Hostile? Find out:

Some legal requirements for a hostile work environment include these: - The action must be discriminatory based on as age, religion, disability, or race.
- The action must have lasted over a period of time and not based on one or two remarks that someone found annoying.
- The action must have been reported to the HR department for corrective measures to be taken.
- The hostile behavior, actions, or communication must be severe enough to disrupt productivity. 
Understanding the difference between what constitutes a hostile work environment and what does not is difficult. We are here to help for that exact reason.

115,"... I learned a lot yesterday in The Managing Humans class. This was one of the most profound, as it pertains to my current situation.
.
I understood why I was so affected by what has been happening over the past few weeks. The feedback I was given was intended to KEEP me in my PERCEIVED PLACE.
.
Once I asked for clarification, I was informed the feedback was to assess my NEEDS and will help me GROW. .
.
May I never feel the need to use feedback in this manner because of my own lack of accountability and understanding.
.
.
May I continue to lead with patience, empathy and awareness.
.
I learned that feedback is a very valuable tool. I encourage everyone to teach and learn how to give and receive feedback.
.
.
Skills are learnable. Never stop learning; but know when to leave the table when you’re no longer being served.

126,"One time I had a couple bosses (men) tell me that 9/10 times I’m happy, a pleasure to be around, but that other 1/10 times I’m not. They also advised me to work on myself and be more perfect. I’m a lady, 
so I should always be smiling and pleasant. 
My employment was dependent upon my perfection.
I was let go months later.
I had “a problem with attitude”, and making men feel uncomfortable. 
One of the bosses thought I hated him and made his partners confront me about it because he was too afraid. He didn’t even show to the meeting.
I was presented with a “separation agreement”, offered some money as long as I would agree to sign the terms of the contract. They wanted me silent, but wouldn’t reciprocate any of the terms.
They didn’t want me speaking of their misogyny, racism, sexism, blatant discrimination, or inappropriate sex related remarks. 
I walked away empty handed.
Not mad.
Not sad.
But Empowered.
Empowered to speak out. To let my sisters know, I’m with you. 
I stand with you.
I speak with you.
I will never keep the injustices of ANYONE - FOR ANY REASON - behind closed doors. 
I will not allow someone, ANYONE, the space to openly drop their prejudices in my presence.
Not without standing up.
Not without correcting them.
Not without showing the fuck up for you. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

132,"I was 19.
She was 25. (Let's call her R).
Her boyfriend Pallav was 24.
We met in 2008 (all of us), for a content writing project for #KuoniDestinationManagement.
I was pretty much the teenager, the happy-go-lucky types, got along with almost everyone.
R was the serious types, smiled often but laughed consciously.
And He... the villain of this #MeTooStory, #PallavGogoi was our senior, Assistant manager in the process and our mentor too. He taught us how to work with the tools, how to write the content etc.
All the team members worked under his guidance.
We all had formed a good Bond with each other.
And Pallav was the most friendly one!
R had a crush on him. I too had a bit of a thing for him. You know.. just a teenager thing because he was friendly. And I think he sensed it. R and I had become instant friends. We used to sit together & talk a lot. Pallav used to frequent our bay pretty often to see if we had any problem working.
Many a times he would lean towards me while standing and I would feel awkward. I used to offer him my seat if he wanted to sit. It happened a lot. I guess he was more into R because just after few weeks she told me that they are dating.
I wasn't supposed to tell anyone. It was our secret. Pallav used to joke about it how casually I acted around them as if I don't know anything. But sometimes I saw a look in his eyes that made me uncomfortable. But he was my friend's boyfriend who wouldn't stop praising him. He made her Happy. And I didn't know how to react. I was just 19. No one had ever told me anything about #WorkPlaceHarassment. I took it lightly. One day, when R didn't come to office and I didn't finish my work on time, I stayed back a little longer when everyone else left except Pallav & another workmate, who worked in a cubicle. I have had alone moments with Pallav before but never in the absence of other workmates. I didn't care because I was too engrossed in my work. Pallav came to my bay and we started chatting. I don't remember what were we talking about. I had a friendly equation with him. He sat on the chair beside me and we continued chatting. And there comes his hand... On my thigh... (Rest in comments)",workplaceharassment,"|And there comes his hand... On my thigh... And he kept it there for a little while before removing it. I didn't know if it was a normal thing amongst friends (if we were friends) or if it was a gesture that I should worry about because he was my senior, so I acted casually, that day and everyday afterwards! I Never told my friend about it. I didn't want to do anything to make her upset or to think of me as someone who's hitting on her boyfriend as she had made a sarcastic comment once on how come I knew (he himself told me) that he has a bike but she (the girlfriend) doesn't? So I didn't share this incident with her or with anyone. I thought maybe it was an adult thing to touch others while talking and reacting won't look cool.Though that gesture was never repeated but such memories stay with you for a really long time. I accepted a touch that was completely uncalled for!
You could say this is not harassment but it was! And it took me years to understand that. I have worked in 8 organizations I think, out of which 4 had people who did make gestures I didn't understand easily if they were sexual or not. Coming too close was Normal for them. Touching your hands again and again while talking was ok for them. Compliments were showered as if I was an ""👼Angel""! And for someone, watching porn in front of me was no big deal (left that office after 2 weeks as I knew how lewd it was).
Now don't start comparing other's #MeToo stories with mine. I can imagine their pain. I know they have suffered a lot more than me. But it doesn't mean that I wasn't affected a bit. I have had panic attacks in my offices while working. I used to hide in the washroom to avoid people. I did complain once about a senior to a fellow mate and she suggested to take it to a higher level but that senior was considered a ""saint"" like person by others. I was afraid. I didn't understand if I was uncomfortable because of my own trust issues or my gut feeling was right. I didn't involve anyone in this and tried to change my perspective towards him yet I never felt ok around him. I always maintained distance. I still haven't figured out if I felt that way because of|. I still haven't figured out if I felt that way because of my issues as I do have trouble trusting people in corporate culture or elsewhere.
I wish I had been taught what harassment is, no matter how ""small"" it looks, just so I could take a stand for myself as early as I can detect it! 
No one taught me, Life did!
Life has given me experiences at the expense of my sanity!
I hope we (the society) learn to support other Women who came out and shared their stories to teach our future generations what shouldn't be accepted at all even if it looks ""harmless""!
Can we make it normal, talking about harassment openly?|PS: R broke up with Pallav a year later because he had been cheating on her with another girlfriend. In case you wanted to take his side, I thought I should tell people that he really wasn't a nice guy (though I don't owe any explanation to anyone!)|💯no explanation required....kudos to u girl for coming out and sharing it",9

The line was launched by donations from the public, and is currently backed by Time’s Up U.K.’s justice and equality fund, and managed by Rosa, which is the U.K. Fund for Women and Girls. The charity Rights of Women will provide advice for callers. “Understanding what your rights are, how you can assert them and the choices you have if you’ve experienced harassment is such a vital part of creating safe workplaces for everyone, and this advice line is such a huge development in ensuring that all women are supported, wherever we work,” said Watson. “This advice line’s purpose is to empower women to exercise their legal rights in the workplace,” said Rights of Women’s senior legal officer, Deeba Syed. “By advising women about their legal options and increasing their understanding of equalities and discrimination law, we will be able to help them make informed choices about next steps, including how to navigate the legal system with confidence.” #friday #friyay #feministfriday #fridayfeminism #feminist #feminism #womenempowerment #empoweringwomen #learnyourrights #femalerights #femaleempowerment #womensrights #workplacewellness #workplacesafety #workplaceculture #workculturematters #timesup #womansreality #nomore #metoo #sexism #workplaceharassment #fem2 #womenempowermentquotes #womenempoweringwomen #empoweringwomen #empoweredwomen",workplaceharassment,|I love her💕|🙌🏼❤️💪🏼|✊,32

Have seen so many people struggling with making and managing friends and relationships. People feel that everyone should talk to them and that too politely and humbly but we must remember that there are few people from whom we expect love and respect but we won't get them from them.

Remember, not everyone at your workplace is your friend. You will have to face few people with different ideology . So, do your work and live with people who bring the magic out of you .

This post is in support of workplace equality and promoting better work places👌👌 So grateful to experience this in my life too.

162,"Harassment free workplace a democratic right. Every corporate puts a proud presentation on the first day of joining stating that they won't tolerate any kind of sexual harassment and it should and reported immediately without any fear. What happened to Revathi in her organization is highly condemnable. If this was not investigated in a proper manner then what is the use of HR, ethics, sexual harassment committee. All workplaces must ensure safety of their employees. TCS is manager driven company but as a top rated IT company what happened in @TCS is unacceptable. Cabins should have glass doors so that others can see what is happening inside. Managers should be informed to keep the cabin doors open when they are with female employees inside. It's very tough for women, to prove that molestation really happened. Hats off to the lady who decided to take the things further. Don't want to accuse anyone immediately. @RNTata2000 has always stood for values. The main cluprit who humiliated the woman associate in the name of appraisal must be punished, the verdict should be a lesson for the other saddist in office. Girls, speak out & stand up for yourselves! Be it a group of guys calling names or your boss at work. It’s that moron who has to feel ashamed not you. Hope justice will be served in this case without partiality. Let's Fight against corporate molestation. #JusticeforTCSemployee

The legislation, which Cuomo signed into law Aug. 12, has dozens of amendments to New York’s existing workplace harassment laws, but its most notable changes include removing the “severe or pervasive” wording, which set a requirement for the level of severity abusive conduct must have before a company can be held accountable. Additionally, the new law expands the definition of what a company can consider an “employee,” including independent contractors and other outside workers who serve an organization.

168,"Hello everyone! ❤️ Here is my #thursdaytips for you! 📣
.
.
.
.
Except for Texas, every state legally requires companies to carry workers' compensation insurance either through a private insurer or the state, or the business can elect to be self-insured. Each state has different rules regarding what is covered, how issues are evaluated, how medical care is delivered and the amount of benefits an employee can receive, so be sure to check your state's regulations. .
.
Business owners can reduce claims and lower their premiums by … - Assessing the safety of the work environment by investigating how safe the equipment is, determining whether it needs to be repaired or replaced, offering safety gear where needed and providing ergonomic office equipment. - Creating a safe work environment by training all employees on workplace safety, offering updates and tips on best practices, and incentivizing employees' accident-free work. - Getting injured employees back to work faster. - Starting an employee wellness program to encourage healthy living and fitness, which can reduce the number of employees injured on the job.

213,"3. Cat - calling

This is very common in Nigeria.

Women usually suffer cat - calling that is unwelcome rude whistle or comment of a sexual nature. Often at the workplace, employees throw bants at each other in various forms or crude words, suggestive remarks, etc. However coming from a employer, superior or boss throws the junior or subordinate off balance, kind of an helpless position.

In this instance, the sexually harassed victim should observe or record the event, take note of possible witnesses in order to make his / her case before the management. One very good thing about cat calling is that the abused will usually do it derisively in front of co - employees to shame the victim.

4. In Nigeria, feminist women and men who promote feminist ideals are prone to sexual harassment. They are called unprintable names. Though most of these victims enjoy strength from within themselves, but some are broken. Abusers of feminist ideals will say uncouth words, physically abuse their victims, even,send messages or pictures to make hellish their lives. The victims should note witnesses, document any hard evidence, record events on audio or video to make a strong case

227,"ICYMI on Medium, ""You Are Here*: Labeling the Problem in Your Workplace Culture."" Have you ever been told to communicate like this? ""When you [x], it makes me feel [y]""? For example, ""When you raise your voice, it makes me feel afraid""? ⠀
⠀
The problem with that kind of communication is that it makes it sound like your feeling is the problem, rather than the other person's behavior. It sounds like the other person's behavior is okay, as long as you toughen up. Really, the other person's behavior may be inappropriate, no matter how you feel. ⠀
⠀
I teach my clients that it is possible to say, ""When you raise your voice, you look immature."" That makes it clear that the other person's behavior is the problem, not your feelings. I can feel great, and someone raising their voice may still look immature. ⠀
⠀
On the other hand, sometimes the problem really is that we feel terrible at work, and we don't know how to get out of that terrible feeling. It's important to identify the specific problem first so that you know what problem you are solving. ⠀

239,"""Lawyer advises young peers to stick a fork in client's hand if sexually harassed."" That's one piece of advice . . . . In my view, the problem with it isn't just that it sounds silly and could get the victim arrested. ⠀
⠀
It also misses that a lot of sexual harassment does not involve any kind of physical contact or physical threat (or at least doesn't start out that way). ⠀
⠀
It misses that a lot of sexual harassment is targeted at women because they are women and has nothing to do with sexual advances. ⠀
⠀
It misses that a lot of people would never commit violence, even when they experience violence . . . and that they are reasonable, smart people.⠀
⠀
It misses that there are thousands of responses to sexual harassment that shuts it down and creates a safe environment.⠀
⠀
It misses that many people do not carry forks with them to work and a lot of sexual harassment happens away from the dinner table. ⠀
⠀
So, what's your go-to response to harassment? Mine is typically humor. A client I had liked to say she needed a moment and walk away. What do you do when someone is acting inappropriately? ⠀

I dealt with this up until the year she left. And then there were also a few other girls who did this. This shit is really degrading Man. I hope it starts to change.|Wow I thought slap ass Friday was just a thing at my middle school... that’s insane. Thank you for doing what you do and spreading awareness. For a new student first year into middle school with slap ass Friday being more common than I thought, this can be the perfect way for them to be aware and hopefully try to avoid these situations.

I was mortified. I waited too long to tell anybody so he didn't get in trouble.  I always thought to myself, 'im ugly and fat, why would someone even care enough to do this too me?'

This month we are talking about the gendered world of paid work. We'll be touching on some concepts, like the glass ceiling and the glass escalator; and we'll discuss some of the ways gender and workplace cultures interact. We may also look at the ways gender influences pay, time off, workplace policies, dress codes, and more. Come be part of the conversation!

261,"I’ve been feeling really guilty about reporting the guy who’s been harassing me at work. Maybe I should’ve talked to him first before going to HR. There were plenty of times where I could’ve spoken up. Everyone at work loves him, he’s a nice guy, I don’t want people to be mad at me for getting him fired. He’s been with the company for over 20 years. Well today, my boss found letters and statements from other girls dating back as far as ten years ago. “He brushed up against my butt.” “I’ve heard stories from other girls who had it worse than me, so I didn’t say anything because I thought I didn’t have as much to complain about.” “He comments on my body all the time.” “I didn’t say anything because he lives in my neighborhood and I didn’t want this problem to follow me out of work.” “He makes me really uncomfortable.” And HR had no idea about any of this. As far as they were concerned, this was his first offense because he didn’t have anything on record. Which means these girls told someone they trusted, only for it to fall on deaf ears. As I was reading these statements I felt like I was reading letters from ghosts. Where did these girls go? Did they transfer or quit because of him? One letter was even from a customer. In a way it was very validating for me. My attitude instantly changed from feeling bad for him, to fuck this guy! I’m sorry these girls didn’t get the justice they deserved. The comfort and validation that I did. That they didn’t have someone on their team. But guess what girls. He’s as good as fucking gone.

Whenever I write a book, I choose one ideal reader of the book, and I write it as a love letter to her. My ideal reader this time loves elephants, and thinking about that inspired me to think about elephants throughout writing the book. I don’t talk about elephants at all in the book, but I thought about them constantly while writing. ⠀

When I met with my editor after finishing the first draft, she gave me this elephant necklace as congratulations for the accomplishment. I hadn’t told her about the elephants and she was surprised to hear they were an inspiration. This just shows how powerful inspiration can be. Thank you, Bethany!!⠀

(a) There's more sexual harassment happening now.⠀
(b) More women are being honest in reporting their experiences.⠀
(c) More women understand what sexual harassment is and are able to report more accurately.⠀

290,"I’ve been a teacher for nearly a decade.  While venting to my god-mother (who is a Psychologist) about my workplace woes, one of the things she said was “baby girl, you gotta play the game”. That statement frustrated me immensely!  You see, I love what I do, but loathe workplace politics.  My priority is to deliver high-quality work, and I do so.  But I’m not the least bit interested in being required to laugh at the boss’ unfunny jokes, brown-nosing for clout, or office gossip.  I am open to genuine connections though.  I’m professional and pleasant, but I don’t linger.  I learned early on that this isn’t well received, especially by your superiors.  Unfortunately, some “professionals” can’t separate business from their personal feelings.  This has caused me soooooo many problems throughout my career.  You wouldn’t believe it!  However, I’m still not interested in playing the game.  I’m creating my own lane, income independent of an employer, and a community where ego-stroking and ass-kissing aren’t job requirements 💅🏾 I wrote a book to share my stories, and am building a brand around my expertise and experiences.  I’m very low-key and private, so this requires me to step outside my comfort zone.  The anxiety is real 🙈

38,"3. Cat - calling

This is very common in Nigeria.

Women usually suffer cat - calling that is unwelcome rude whistle or comment of a sexual nature. Often at the workplace, employees throw bants at each other in various forms or crude words, suggestive remarks, etc. However coming from a employer, superior or boss throws the junior or subordinate off balance, kind of an helpless position.

In this instance, the sexually harassed victim should observe or record the event, take note of possible witnesses in order to make his / her case before the management. One very good thing about cat calling is that the abused will usually do it derisively in front of co - employees to shame the victim.

4. In Nigeria, feminist women and men who promote feminist ideals are prone to sexual harassment. They are called unprintable names. Though most of these victims enjoy strength from within themselves, but some are broken. Abusers of feminist ideals will say uncouth words, physically abuse their victims, even,send messages or pictures to make hellish their lives. The victims should note witnesses, document any hard evidence, record events on audio or video to make a strong case

52,"ICYMI on Medium, ""You Are Here*: Labeling the Problem in Your Workplace Culture."" Have you ever been told to communicate like this? ""When you [x], it makes me feel [y]""? For example, ""When you raise your voice, it makes me feel afraid""? ⠀
⠀
The problem with that kind of communication is that it makes it sound like your feeling is the problem, rather than the other person's behavior. It sounds like the other person's behavior is okay, as long as you toughen up. Really, the other person's behavior may be inappropriate, no matter how you feel. ⠀
⠀
I teach my clients that it is possible to say, ""When you raise your voice, you look immature."" That makes it clear that the other person's behavior is the problem, not your feelings. I can feel great, and someone raising their voice may still look immature. ⠀
⠀
On the other hand, sometimes the problem really is that we feel terrible at work, and we don't know how to get out of that terrible feeling. It's important to identify the specific problem first so that you know what problem you are solving. ⠀

64,"""Lawyer advises young peers to stick a fork in client's hand if sexually harassed."" That's one piece of advice . . . . In my view, the problem with it isn't just that it sounds silly and could get the victim arrested. ⠀
⠀
It also misses that a lot of sexual harassment does not involve any kind of physical contact or physical threat (or at least doesn't start out that way). ⠀
⠀
It misses that a lot of sexual harassment is targeted at women because they are women and has nothing to do with sexual advances. ⠀
⠀
It misses that a lot of people would never commit violence, even when they experience violence . . . and that they are reasonable, smart people.⠀
⠀
It misses that there are thousands of responses to sexual harassment that shuts it down and creates a safe environment.⠀
⠀
It misses that many people do not carry forks with them to work and a lot of sexual harassment happens away from the dinner table. ⠀
⠀
So, what's your go-to response to harassment? Mine is typically humor. A client I had liked to say she needed a moment and walk away. What do you do when someone is acting inappropriately? ⠀

Girls would have those over-the-shoulder binders cover their butts because none of us wanted to be touched like that. And if your ass didn’t get slapped; you were “ugly”, so you were expected to be grateful to be touched|The third one.. my friend had an apple thrown at her, got a concussion, and our vice principal said “boys will be boys” ugh|things are kept anonymous when they're shared once they're submitted via the link, right?|Wtf is wrong with these ppl all this bull needs to end #stopharrassement|Love your work- so powerful|We had slap ass friday too|We need to teach boys to know and be better than this. We need to educate them that saying these things and doing these things is fucking wrong. It's hurtful to people in so many ways and to see this behavior continued makes me sick.

Its gross that people can get away with this sort of shit.|Oh yeah at my middle school they would have that Friday then thighs on Thursday and “titty squeeze Tuesday” something like that that didn’t go on for very long though and it was mostly the girls with their friends though (still violating) but there was like something for every day of the week and it made me so scared to go to school|Last year one of my teachers wrapped his arm around me while he was sitting down and put his head on my breast. I told my counselors the next day and they called the cops. They interviewed me and stuff.

He'd hit, punch, kick, pinch, and bite me. I came home daily covered in bruises for two years. When brought up to the teacher and principle multiple times I got told ""boys will be boys"" and ""he's just doing that because he likes you."" I shouldn't of had to deal with that abuse as long as I did. A little girl shouldn't have to come home from school covered in bruises crying all because of a boy physically abusing me who wouldn't leave me alone no matter who I told nor where I hid.

But hey ""boys will be boys"" and ""he's just doing that because he likes you.""|I like the whole sidewalk chalk idea but not a fan of text message short story that seems to follow the post these days.

I went to the bathroom and then went back to the table where I was sitting and I believe I had put back on the clothes I was wearing because I didnt like how many kids there were and I wasn't very comfortable so. I sit down and there were a few boys sitting there and one of them tells me (god bless him because he saved me) that my boobs had just been rated by this guy sitting next to me, now I dont know if this is a pass because it was 6th graders but I don't think it was okay at all and I was like WHAT THE FRICK!!! I asked the kid who rated them if he looked at my boobs then and he had THE NERVE to say no, (and if yall think they were playing me they weren't a lot of people backed it) anyways , at the end of the day I told my teacher which (also god bless her she is a beautiful person who made grade 6 much more bearable) and she said she would idk look into it or something but guess. what. she took it to the school and told them that this had happened and how that its unacceptable. YA WANNA KNOW WHAT THE SCHOOL SAID? ooohhh boys will be boys LMAOOOOOOOOO. when I got into the car that day I freaking cried to my mom because that was the first time something like that had ever happened to me. anyways so the kid was confronted and he lied that he didnt say it, but with the help of a few witnesses he confessed he did it and wrote me an apology letter, I explained to him that that's something that you just cant do blah blah.

This month we are talking about the gendered world of paid work. We'll be touching on some concepts, like the glass ceiling and the glass escalator; and we'll discuss some of the ways gender and workplace cultures interact. We may also look at the ways gender influences pay, time off, workplace policies, dress codes, and more. Come be part of the conversation!

86,"I’ve been feeling really guilty about reporting the guy who’s been harassing me at work. Maybe I should’ve talked to him first before going to HR. There were plenty of times where I could’ve spoken up. Everyone at work loves him, he’s a nice guy, I don’t want people to be mad at me for getting him fired. He’s been with the company for over 20 years. Well today, my boss found letters and statements from other girls dating back as far as ten years ago. “He brushed up against my butt.” “I’ve heard stories from other girls who had it worse than me, so I didn’t say anything because I thought I didn’t have as much to complain about.” “He comments on my body all the time.” “I didn’t say anything because he lives in my neighborhood and I didn’t want this problem to follow me out of work.” “He makes me really uncomfortable.” And HR had no idea about any of this. As far as they were concerned, this was his first offense because he didn’t have anything on record. Which means these girls told someone they trusted, only for it to fall on deaf ears. As I was reading these statements I felt like I was reading letters from ghosts. Where did these girls go? Did they transfer or quit because of him? One letter was even from a customer. In a way it was very validating for me. My attitude instantly changed from feeling bad for him, to fuck this guy! I’m sorry these girls didn’t get the justice they deserved. The comfort and validation that I did. That they didn’t have someone on their team. But guess what girls. He’s as good as fucking gone.

90,"When I was writing The Inclusive Leader’s Guide to Healthy Workplace Culture, one of my inspirations was an elephant. Whenever I write a book, I choose one ideal reader of the book, and I write it as a love letter to her. My ideal reader this time loves elephants, and thinking about that inspired me to think about elephants throughout writing the book. I don’t talk about elephants at all in the book, but I thought about them constantly while writing. ⠀
.⠀
.⠀
When I met with my editor after finishing the first draft, she gave me this elephant necklace as congratulations for the accomplishment. I hadn’t told her about the elephants and she was surprised to hear they were an inspiration. This just shows how powerful inspiration can be. Thank you, Bethany!!⠀

What do you think this means? ⠀
(a) There's more sexual harassment happening now.⠀
(b) More women are being honest in reporting their experiences.⠀
(c) More women understand what sexual harassment is and are able to report more accurately.⠀

I'm always curious whether we should take higher reporting rates as a good thing or a bad thing. What do you think?⠀

115,"I’ve been a teacher for nearly a decade.  While venting to my god-mother (who is a Psychologist) about my workplace woes, one of the things she said was “baby girl, you gotta play the game”. That statement frustrated me immensely!  You see, I love what I do, but loathe workplace politics.  My priority is to deliver high-quality work, and I do so.  But I’m not the least bit interested in being required to laugh at the boss’ unfunny jokes, brown-nosing for clout, or office gossip.  I am open to genuine connections though.  I’m professional and pleasant, but I don’t linger.  I learned early on that this isn’t well received, especially by your superiors.  Unfortunately, some “professionals” can’t separate business from their personal feelings.  This has caused me soooooo many problems throughout my career.  You wouldn’t believe it!  However, I’m still not interested in playing the game.  I’m creating my own lane, income independent of an employer, and a community where ego-stroking and ass-kissing aren’t job requirements 💅🏾 I wrote a book to share my stories, and am building a brand around my expertise and experiences.  I’m very low-key and private, so this requires me to step outside my comfort zone.  The anxiety is real 🙈

13:00 hrs- 13:50 hrs
Saheed Nagar , Bhubaneswar
Odisha.

Today sharing this incident that happened a week ago doesn't let myself feel being safe in my hometown. Today I don't feel secure to have lunch in a well maintained multi-cuisine restaurant ,not alone but with my friends. 
And yet today writing about injustice towards women, harassment , rapes and empowerment , I failed to protect my along with my friends dignity inspite of the fact that India is a country where we have the right to freedom. 
This ain't a made-up story being a writer , but the incident which has been disturbing me since past a week. Thinking it to be a small issue I decided to ignore for making girls rather I would say making women feel uncomfortable is in trends now. But I couldn't hold myself up and tonight i stand here in the platform of social media to seek answer for what did we do to get these behaviour while having a normal day out with my friends.The incident took place as follows :- It was around 13:00 hrs when we entered to a ""multi-cuisine restaurant"" , Chancellor (I will mention this a lot , because the reply of the manager will shock you) and since we had a great day, we ordered our food to have a good appetite. 
Later two fellas entered into the restaurant and sat infront of us ,(facing towards 3 of my mates , including me) while 2 of my friends sat infront of us. It's was perhaps 13:40 when I observed that the guy in the blue shirt was staring continuously at us but I preferred to ignore it as I had just looked at him , thinking rather mistaking to be a coincidence. But later after 15 minutes , I saw the other fellow who was continuously getting up from his chair and peeping up !! At first it was kind of uncomfortable (put yourself in my shoes and imagine what if you are enjoying a hot morsel with your friends and 2 guys keep staring continuously) we decided to not to resist anymore. Fuming with anger yet as the restaurant was busy , we decided not to create any sort of havoc rather talk to the manager directly , infact being confident enough as there was a CCTV CAMERA which immediately faced towards those people. *Continued in comments*",workplaceharassment,"|1.After having the half-hearted lunch , we went up for the manager and I complained about the incident that made me uncomfortable while the guys were standing next to me. Thinking about ensuring our safety , the manager would take steps against them he slowly replied , "" Ma'am ,they are also our customers as you! How can we say them anything"" . This shook me back to think again before creating any nuisance and standing for right even though we had their video and photographs for the manager denied to help.This incident has put me in a dilemma to post it or complaint against this incident. Yes , this might be a small petty issue as compared to whats happening in the society but isn't this where it gets started.|It's been a week that has put me into deep thought for seeking an answer , who is responsible for our safety ? Is it just we ? Isn't it the people who claim themselves as the witness after crime? Isn't the people incharge of the ""crime scene"" ? Or is it just that I call myself as a self proclaimed Feminist , am not allowed to seek help? When I talk about women of our society being harassed , people being raped , equality , I don't mean by Feminism , rather I talk about Humanity. Is it wrong? What is it ?Take some time ,away from the meme world , from your daily chores to answer me today for I as another girl who felt unsafe in-between a large number of people they say as SOCIETY.

138,"I’m not a negative nelly in the slightest, and I hope this post doesn’t come across as being negative in any way as that’s not my intention 🙏

I hadn’t really thought much about a statement like this, given that I don’t have any haters, but then one reared their ugly head into my life again on Sunday, and hopefully I can help others who have experienced the same thing.

For about 3 years in my old job I received abusive and threatening text messages and phone calls from a person I was ‘managing’ and despite following the correct channels of complaint with my employer, these incidents were never dealt with nor stopped.

Fast forward 9 months since I last saw or heard from the person who was dealing this awful behaviour, and here we go again. For no reason other than that I posted a picture of myself and my husband, and talked about the success I was seeing in my business, and I receive numerous negative and pretty hateful comments. Although it was quite upsetting at the time, as soon as I realised that the comments were as a result of how he was feeling, and actually nothing to do with me or any of my actions, I understood that in life we’ll always have haters, not because these people hate you, but because they hate themselves.

I will have a successful business, and I will help others do the same, because I refuse to allow myself to be put into a situation like that again where I felt powerless to stop the harassment I was receiving, and I trusted that my employer would safeguard my wellbeing. Well they didn’t, and as a result, I never want to have to work with people that I don’t choose to, hence one reason I am so passionate about working for myself.

So don’t let the haters get you down, use their hatred to motivate you to be your best, and show them that you’ll never give up, because you’re a winner, and they’ll still just be a hater 🙏

Surveys show that sexual harassment affects nearly 40 percent of women, that less than a quarter formally report it, and that those who do are likely to experience retaliation from their employer. We asked an expert for advice on how to assess a situation and take action if you decide you want to.

143,"To day I went for some groccery shoping at imtiaz and I saw a guy touched a girls back and ran smartly so no one could see him.. that girl seemed like about 23 24 yo. she turned arround and tried to see his face but he was fast or we can say that he has plenty of practice in escaping the situation like this. I told her he went this way but she seemed more confused and terrified so she just hold her younger brothers hand and walked away.. I feel literally ashamed after experiencing such an awful scenario. You have no idea how much traumatized one felt after experiencing a bad touch I can only imagining it by watching it. 
Just imagine her fear she might not be able to walk freely again. she might not be able to trust anyone again.

The guy who did this to her, If you are reading this. please ask for forgiveness because what ever you are doing with someone else's daughter and sister, a perve like you could do this to your ""Loved ones"" too (God Forbid). May Allah keep us safe. I request you all please take good care of each other whether you know them personally or not. Its important to keep an eye on each other.  especially when perve like him wandering arround freely.

En plena agitación por el ""efecto Weinstein"" (2017), el cocinero estadounidense fue acusado ""de conductas y tocamientos inapropiados"" por tres de sus trabajadoras.
.
Batali fue uno de los primeros cocineros en ser denunciados; sin embargo, resulta significativo que, a dos años de la aparición del movimiento MeToo, en Cocina han surgido apenas aislados casos, en especial si se tiene en cuenta que es un sitio dirigido en su mayoría por hombres y donde prima un ambiente machista.
.
.
La respuesta creo ubicarla en un hecho asaz despreciable: la normalización del ambiente de cocina aceptado tácitamente por acosadores y acosados.
.
.
Pero vengamos a lo no mediático. No pocas cocineras y estudiantes de gastronomía me han confiado sus historias de acoso (el ejercido entre compañeros) u hostigamiento (donde existe una implicación jerárquica): que si un chef que hace un comentario inapropiado, otro que solicita fotos de la chica en bikini, aquél que consuela a una practicante de una ruptura amorosa y la acaricia de manera lasciva y el detestable caso del chef que abusó de una chica alcoholizada.
.
.
Ninguno resulta más grave que otro, antes bien, se trata de la gradación del acoso sexual.
.
.
Es frecuente que estas denuncias se anquilosen pues la persona acosada, además de ser atacada por sorpresa y, por tanto, comience a dudar de lo ocurrido, debe padecer las inadecuadas opiniones de comadres que juzgan desde la ventana y pretenden ubicar en la falda, el escote o el carácter extrovertido del acosado el motivo que despertó la concupiscencia del hostigador, como si éste fuese un perro condicionado por Pavlov y no un ser humano.

.
La aquiescencia es la única entrada de esa barrera infranqueable porque el acoso sexual se da ante la falta de coincidencia en el deseo de alguna de las dos partes.
.
.
Justo lo que colabora a perpetuar estos nefandos actos es la división de responsabilidades entre las partes, cuando nadie es responsable de caer en la mira de un manipulador y narcisista (acosador) que cosifica a las demás personas para despojarlas de su humanidad y poder atropellarlas sin remordimiento.
.
.
La ventaja del diablo descansa en su huidizo camuflaje, sólo en las Pastorelas lo apreciamos rojizo y sulfúreo y si la cocina ha de ser un infierno lo será por el intenso calor que sus fogones emanan, no por crear un ambiente donde el sumiso ha de ser un objeto y el acosador se esconda bajo la pseudo instrucción del ""así-es-en-cocina"".
.
.
Mejor señale al acosador sus comportamientos inadecuados y normalice la denuncia de acoso sexual sin vergüenza ni culpa ni victimizándose; pues, en la medida que el tema abandone el murmullo y apoyemos a quienes lo han padecido, el acosador se replegará sino al diván del psicólogo a lo menos al ostracismo social.

पहली मुलाकत पर ही दिल में उतार गया था

हल्की सी मुस्कान लेकर वो मुझे छूता रहता था
वो हवसी मेरी हवस को जगाने की कोशिश करता था

मेरा भी ज़िस्म उसके ज़िस्म से मिलने को तरसने लगा था
मुझे इश्क के नशे में देख उसने मेरे ज़िस्म से वस्त्र को अलग किया था

उस रात वो पहली बार मुझे चेहरा उतार कर अपने असली रंग में मिला था

दिल की रानी कहता था जो उसने तवायफ कह बुलाया था
मोहब्बत उसे थी ही नहीं ज़िस्म को पाने के लिए उसने नाटक किया था
मेरे प्यार मेरी मासूमियत के साथ खेल खेला था
फिर मुझे छोड कर पता नहीं कहा चला गया
मोहब्बत की आड़ में शायद किसी ओर को तवायफ बनाने गया था
कितना वक़्त गुजर गया जख्म रूह के अब भी हरे है
सोचती हु मोहब्बत के राह में क्यों इतने धोखे है
हर मोड़ पर क्यों खडे जिस्मो के आशिक है

This week’s Scarlet Letter touches on an often unseen type of workplace harassment and discrimination - invisible illness. •
•
Invisible Illness is typically defined as “a cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, or sensory condition that limits a person’s behaviors, senses, or activities and is not apparent to others.” •
•
Often times, those living with an invisible illness face stigma and judgement from those around them who believe they are simply “making up” or “faking” their suffering.

This is an incredible victory for survivors, who will now have more time to pursue justice, and for every New Yorker, who deserves to work in safety and dignity. 
Thank you @NYGovCuomo, @SenatorBiaggi, @AravellaSimotas and @andreastewartcousins for your unwavering leadership. Your commitment to passing this legislation will impact generations of New Yorkers to come. 
Sending gratitude to @MiraSorvino, @wobblessilva, @CarmenLoBue, @realmichellehurd, @juliannemoore, @GloriaSteinem & the whole TIME’S UP network for raising your voices for the #NYSafetyAgenda & saying #TIMESUP on laws that don’t protect us.

We discussed everything design and business including managing client expectations, budgeting, why I update my contract after each project (lessons learned), building relationships, sexual harassment and protecting yourself and your team. In a nutshell, we covered a lot!

192,"On June 16, the Bombay high court declared that casually touching a colleague does not constitute a case of outraging the modesty of a woman. This order has came in light of a case in which the principal of an ashram school in Maharashtra was booked under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code, for touching the hands of a teacher in the class. In a post-#MeToo country, we are still trying to grapple with what constitutes crossing the line. And given that, last week, the Mumbai Police closed the very case that triggered #MeToo in India—in which actress Tanushree Dutta filed a complaint against co-star Nana Patekar for molesting and harassing her in 2010—saying there wasn't enough ""evidence"" to prove the accused was guilty, we can't help but wonder: Does this court order give more definition to understanding what sexual harassment is, or does it make it easier for the accused to get away with bad behaviour?

That's the thing about consent you know??|just the tip|I would want to high five or have a casual relationship with a colleague 🤔 would it be considered harassment|Casual touching should not be the topic that's being discussed in the high court.|Well.. Sure. It is too much to ask men to not touch women causally. How could we.... Who are we to decide who casually touches our own body..|This is rape culture being endorsed by the high court.|Context is consent.|Shits complex!|The thing is: if your colleagues dont make you uncomfortable by casually touching you it doesn't mean that it's the case for all women.|👌|I practice untouchability with all women to be on safer side.. this one time a woman yelled at me for brushing her arm in a crowded temple..|Eventually it's all about consent. Still just casually touching some girl by mistake should not be ""harassment""|My d.....|Easy, latter. More sensitivity to the current situation is required from the justice system given how easy it is for criminals to be let off the hook for - uh - ""lack"" of evidence. Of course it is understandable for someone to touch a colleague in a casual manner with no untoward implications, but given that it's a fine line between proving an untoward touch and a casual one (proving mens rea is difficult in indian courts and purely based on circumstantial evidence which again happens to be at the discretion of the presiding judges as to what evidence could be ""circumstantial"" enough and what couldn't) and more so in India, the justice system shouldn't blindly apply 'innocent until proven guilty' in all situations, without consideration to the changing reality. Certain crimes, such as those that are sexual in nature, have to be approached with much more flexibility, especially in a country where the vast majority of criminals (notice I didn't say ""accused"") are acquitted for insufficient evidence.|It's all about how the woman feel with that so called 'casual touch'.|People need to understand the meaning of personal space. Sometimes casual for one isn’t the same for other.|It does not  matter whether the touch was by intention or casual. The question is why to touch at all. @viceindia|If you don’t want someone to touch you. Then they can’t. FACTS.|Who the fuck  complaint on a casual touch ? If u have problem with a normal touch sit on home|It's about consent. No one should touch you especially if you don't want them to. You can't just pretend every one likes to be touched.

I NEED you to call your reps! 
We gotta pass the #nysafetyagenda 
3 days left. 
Here’s why:

1. If we change the outdated (archaic really...) “severe or pervasive” standard for #harassment it will make it EASIER  for employees to hold their employers accountable for #sexualharassment in the workplace.

2. This could mandate all Non Disclosure Agreements to include SPECIFIC language that employees may still file a complaint with the state or local agency and or partake in government investigation. * I did not know this ☝🏽when I experienced this first hand while working in a quite FEW #nyc restaurants. 
3. All employers would have to post a sexual harassment poster designed and distributed by the State Division of Human Rights. 
It is a HUMAN RIGHT to NOT have to experience harassment of any kind at work!! And yet it happens all👏🏽 the 👏🏽time 👏🏽so let’s support this bill so that all the folks who missed the memo from the jump won’t miss the memo again nawmean?! It’s 2019 let’s get it together 🙏🏽 and break this toxic cycle.

4. ELIMINATE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR RAPE IN 2nd & 3rd Degree

NY state gives #survivors amongst the shortest amount of time to come forward and seek justice. This is shorter than every state except North Dakota. 
Let’s fix this. Call your reps. Let’s make it HARDER for predators to act violently Let’s make it EASIER for survivors to come forward and seek justice.

205,"A common response to bullying is for people to beat themselves up about their reaction and sense of helplessness.
˙
‘I’m stronger than this’ or ‘I shouldn’t be feeling like this’ are common refrains of the bullying victim.
˙
Accepting that your emotional response is not a sign of weakness or some inner defect is important in your recovery. So is recognising that you had little real choice in your response. The reptilian part of your brain was in charge, there.
˙
One antidote to this self-disgust is to take a ‘lessons learned’ approach and think about what you’ve learned about yourself (and yourself in the world) as a result of this experience.

The discussion was moderated by @vdiamataris (Online Features Editor at Ethnikos Kirikas & The National Herald) and @melagraf89 (Associate VP at Prosek Partners). A wonderful and intimate networking social followed the lively panel discussion.

Thank you to @hellenicprofwomen for inviting our team to be a part of this extremely important and necessary event.

˙
But forgiveness is for you, not the bully. You don’t even have to tell them.
˙
Thinking about the bully and the situation creates an emotional bond to them. Whether it be through anger, frustration or a sense of injustice, you’re giving them a lease on your mental real estate.

An emotional bond is an emotional bond, regardless of whether it’s forged through love or anger.

245,"Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Takumi Nemoto said he will not support a drive to ban dress codes that force women to wear high heels at work.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“It's generally accepted by society that (wearing high heels) is necessary and reasonable in workplaces”, Nemoto said.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Last Monday, members of the #KuToo movement (an amalgam of #MeToo and the Japanese words for shoes, ‘kutsu’ -靴-, and pain, ‘kutsuu’ -苦痛-) submitted a petition with 18,800 signatures to the labor ministry calling for the government to ban companies from requiring women to wear high heels in the workplace, citing health and other issues.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Nemoto added wearing high heels would be an abuse of power if a worker with a hurt foot is forced to wear them.

256,"Unabhängig ihres Herkunftslandes verbinden über 90% der Mädchen und junge Frauen Führungspositionen mit Diskriminierung und sexueller Belästigung! Das zeigt unsere neue Studie „Taking the Lead“. Kein Wunder, dass nur knapp 5% der 500 umsatzstärksten Unternehmen der Welt von Frauen geführt werden und weltweit nur 24% der Parlamentsmitglieder­ weiblich sind. „Die Ergebnisse der Studie sind erschreckend und machen deutlich, dass - wenn wir nicht schnell handeln - Generationen von Mädchen wenig Einfluss auf wichtige Lebensbereiche wie Wirtschaft, Politik oder Gesellschaft haben werden. Deshalb müssen wir die Barrieren abbauen, die Mädchen daran hindern, Führungspositionen zu besetzen“, sagt unsere Geschäftsführerin Maike Röttger.
.
Für die Studie wurden fast 10.000 Mädchen und junge Frauen zwischen 15 und 24 Jahren in 19 Ländern dazu befragt, was sie motiviert, aber auch davon abhält, in verantwortliche Positionen zu gehen. Mehr Infos dazu findet ihr auf unserer Website!

A month ago, I dreaded going to work, I was so anxious and miserable but still I went to work knowing that almost everyone was gossiping about me. At the worst of it I almost gave up and quit and more. I then went on vacation(actually staycation) but just not being at work made a huge difference. When i returned to work, the first day back was pretty bad. But the second day, a person who was with the company for 27 years came up and just started talking to me about random stuff while we worked. And slowly things were that bad anymore. A month later, people are still gossiping but, i now know that I do have some supporters who don't listen and don't care about the gossip. They told me that they know me as a kind, caring, compassionate person. 3 months ago I didn't think I would make it.

278,"Victimhood is not the biggest hindrance to evolution. The attachment to victimhood is the problem. The difference is speaking and noticing your actions. And the other is dwelling in the actions without recognition.
.
The very moment we alleviate the symptoms of victimhood, we will fall “apart”, and the mind will start taking the parts and put them back together. Now we say the mind, we do not mean the existential energy of the mind. But the program, projections and control of how the mind works. Survival does not have to be about packing everything and ready to go. When all you are being asked is to leave the house and create a connection with others.
.
Victimhood is either reaction to the symptoms or creatively see it as a symptom and nothing else. Evolution is yearning nothing to grow. Evolution is happening at this very second in our presence. We just don’t see it because we are created to resume with happiness and joy to see from heart. Our forms are here to deem nothing but enjoy. So, without a doubt our conditions hinder. Our attachments hinder. Never the symptoms. Symptoms are just waiting for you to react not create with it. Deem no worth of it. Continue seeing you are in control of your future without any attachments to what is seeking your symptoms of old realities.
.
You are fantastically enjoying this rooted element called particles, atoms, and light within and out creating abundance and full of grace. So, celebrate life itself, it might surprise you one day and realize, “wow, I thought I was this human condition, but realize I am Love as human form exploring my greatness” and so it is. So, it is.

˙
This is a reasonable response: most of us are more careful about locking up the house after we’ve been robbed.

This response can make us more sensitive to comments intended as jokes, or to any feedback.
˙
You may also find that you feel naked when around groups of people, or in small groups where you feel you are going to be asked about your previous experiences.
˙
This can make it attractive to avoid people altogether.
˙
It can be useful to prepare a ‘go to’ for talking about your bullying experience. If you’re in a very new workplace, you can leave it out of the conversation altogether and announce that you moved because you ‘needed a change’.
˙
If you’re in the same workplace and the bullying has been resolved, you can decide whether to deflect and say that you ‘can’t talk about it’ or casually refer to it as ‘a bad patch’.

297,"So I know I posted back in January some of the reasons I subconsciously made myself invisible by gaining a shit ton of weight. I was reminded today. Twice. I can handle men looking. It can even be extremely good for my ego. I can't handle rapey looks, gestures and disgusting comments that make me afraid now to go walking alone. My husband was even with me, both times (same guys) and I think they were trying to provoke a fight. They almost got one. & hes not too confrontational. It really pisses me off. I expect to be able to leave my house, in tight work out clothes & NOT be sexually harassed to the point Im afraid to be out alone. If I were still 200+ pounds, I wouldn't have to deal with this shit. And if anything ever happens to me, I'll get blamed because of what Im wearing, what I posted on Instagram, or what the fuck ever else. I have intentionally made myself look as unapproachable as possible, since I was a teenager. I did it because I would get this uncomfortable harassment and it was my way of self protection. It didnt work. So I gained a shit ton of weight (I didnt want to be looked at). I want to be looked at, respectfully though. Most men I notice looking are not harassing me. This was blatant, rapey behavior. It's the reason I don't want my16 year old out alone. And these guys seem to live on my walking route. I cant go that way anymore. I'll haveto walk past my kids dads & stepmoms house instead and they'll think I'm stalking THEM! Im really fucking upset. I've been sexually harassed by a former employer when I was 17. I had a guy try to force me to have sex with him at 14. I had other similar harassment experiences. I had a boyfriend do some things that I know now were...I don't want to say the r word but we'll say should not have happened because I very clearly said no and stated my limits. That was a long time ago. But it kind of explains my depression and downward spiral and significant weight gain/not wanting to be seen. I'm not going to let some disrespectful assholes ruin all the work I've done to get where I am now. I look good, I should be able to feel good and look good without worrying about being harassed or worse when I leave my house.",workplaceharassment,"|And just because I rant about some disgusting men or because I've had negative, life altering experiences, DOES NOT mean I think all men are disgusting. I can handle myself. Despite my negative early experiences with men and sex, I love men and I love sex (not with men plural but with 1 MAN, singular). But I DON'T like being blatantly harassed. Look all you like. But don't hang your head out the truck, tongue out all sick like, making gestures and gross comments. And then later try to fight my husband because he told you to stop looking at me (like a rapist.) So now I'm worried about running into them alone.

I'm NOT asking for harassment. I can be half naked and not deserve to be made so uncomfortable. And I get looks every time I go anywhere and that doesn't bother me one bit. It's when it crosses a line that should not be crossed. It shouldn't happen to anyone at all, EVER. Obviously I'm worked up now. They succeeded at taking me out of my place of positivity. But I already know what some people would say. ""You know you like it or you wouldn't blah, blah, blah..."" I've heard it all before. Fuck you.",11
298,"Today, out of nowhere, I spoke to a woman who left a job because she was being #mistreated and not listened to after countless attempts at communicating her concerns. She was treated like a slave beneath those in higher power and was overqualified for the position she was in—this is a form of #WorkplaceHarassment. When I told her she did the right thing by not staying in such an environment, she perked up and was grateful that someone else understood what she was going through. After I was #abused and #bullied and blatantly lied to and #belittled to the point of being screamed at in the face for no reason—I guess I know a little something about the subject. If I am meant to help or inspire others with my experiences—I am game! If you see someone being attacked (verbally, mentally or physically) or witness their well-being, their drive deteriorate before your eyes—do something! Be kind and #supportive!

1,"On June 16, the Bombay high court declared that casually touching a colleague does not constitute a case of outraging the modesty of a woman. This order has came in light of a case in which the principal of an ashram school in Maharashtra was booked under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code, for touching the hands of a teacher in the class. In a post-#MeToo country, we are still trying to grapple with what constitutes crossing the line. And given that, last week, the Mumbai Police closed the very case that triggered #MeToo in India—in which actress Tanushree Dutta filed a complaint against co-star Nana Patekar for molesting and harassing her in 2010—saying there wasn't enough ""evidence"" to prove the accused was guilty, we can't help but wonder: Does this court order give more definition to understanding what sexual harassment is, or does it make it easier for the accused to get away with bad behaviour?

That's the thing about consent you know??|just the tip|I would want to high five or have a casual relationship with a colleague 🤔 would it be considered harassment|Casual touching should not be the topic that's being discussed in the high court.|Well.. Sure. It is too much to ask men to not touch women causally. How could we.... Who are we to decide who casually touches our own body..|This is rape culture being endorsed by the high court.|Context is consent.|Shits complex!|The thing is: if your colleagues dont make you uncomfortable by casually touching you it doesn't mean that it's the case for all women.|👌|I practice untouchability with all women to be on safer side.. this one time a woman yelled at me for brushing her arm in a crowded temple..|Eventually it's all about consent. Still just casually touching some girl by mistake should not be ""harassment""|My d.....|Easy, latter. More sensitivity to the current situation is required from the justice system given how easy it is for criminals to be let off the hook for - uh - ""lack"" of evidence. Of course it is understandable for someone to touch a colleague in a casual manner with no untoward implications, but given that it's a fine line between proving an untoward touch and a casual one (proving mens rea is difficult in indian courts and purely based on circumstantial evidence which again happens to be at the discretion of the presiding judges as to what evidence could be ""circumstantial"" enough and what couldn't) and more so in India, the justice system shouldn't blindly apply 'innocent until proven guilty' in all situations, without consideration to the changing reality. Certain crimes, such as those that are sexual in nature, have to be approached with much more flexibility, especially in a country where the vast majority of criminals (notice I didn't say ""accused"") are acquitted for insufficient evidence.|It's all about how the woman feel with that so called 'casual touch'.|People need to understand the meaning of personal space. Sometimes casual for one isn’t the same for other.|It does not  matter whether the touch was by intention or casual. The question is why to touch at all. @viceindia|If you don’t want someone to touch you. Then they can’t. FACTS.|Who the fuck  complaint on a casual touch ?

I NEED you to call your reps! 
We gotta pass the #nysafetyagenda 
3 days left. 
Here’s why:

1. If we change the outdated (archaic really...) “severe or pervasive” standard for #harassment it will make it EASIER  for employees to hold their employers accountable for #sexualharassment in the workplace.

2. This could mandate all Non Disclosure Agreements to include SPECIFIC language that employees may still file a complaint with the state or local agency and or partake in government investigation. * I did not know this ☝🏽when I experienced this first hand while working in a quite FEW #nyc restaurants. 
3. All employers would have to post a sexual harassment poster designed and distributed by the State Division of Human Rights. 
It is a HUMAN RIGHT to NOT have to experience harassment of any kind at work!! And yet it happens all👏🏽 the 👏🏽time 👏🏽so let’s support this bill so that all the folks who missed the memo from the jump won’t miss the memo again nawmean?! It’s 2019 let’s get it together 🙏🏽 and break this toxic cycle.

4. ELIMINATE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR RAPE IN 2nd & 3rd Degree

NY state gives #survivors amongst the shortest amount of time to come forward and seek justice. This is shorter than every state except North Dakota. 
Let’s fix this. Call your reps. Let’s make it HARDER for predators to act violently Let’s make it EASIER for survivors to come forward and seek justice.

14,"A common response to bullying is for people to beat themselves up about their reaction and sense of helplessness.
˙
‘I’m stronger than this’ or ‘I shouldn’t be feeling like this’ are common refrains of the bullying victim.
˙
Accepting that your emotional response is not a sign of weakness or some inner defect is important in your recovery. So is recognising that you had little real choice in your response. The reptilian part of your brain was in charge, there.
˙
One antidote to this self-disgust is to take a ‘lessons learned’ approach and think about what you’ve learned about yourself (and yourself in the world) as a result of this experience.

In the era of the #MeToo movement, the rules of the workplace are changing for women and men and our voice is even more powerful than ever. 
PN Lawyers Attorney Eleni Melekou was graciously asked to speak about the legal issues at play regarding sexual harassment in the workplace, alongside other notable women such as @deemanis (Executive VP Chief People Officer of S&P Global) and Honorable @aravellasimotas (NYS Assemblymember). The discussion was moderated by @vdiamataris (Online Features Editor at Ethnikos Kirikas & The National Herald) and @melagraf89 (Associate VP at Prosek Partners). A wonderful and intimate networking social followed the lively panel discussion.

23,"There will come a time when you’ll need to forgive the bully. I know, I know: they don’t deserve it, after all they’ve put you through and the way they’ve treated you.
˙
But forgiveness is for you, not the bully. You don’t even have to tell them.
˙
Thinking about the bully and the situation creates an emotional bond to them. Whether it be through anger, frustration or a sense of injustice, you’re giving them a lease on your mental real estate.
˙
An emotional bond is an emotional bond, regardless of whether it’s forged through love or anger.

Forgiveness is the final step in regaining your power and sense of self-confidence and will be your closure on this episode in your life.",workplaceharassment,"|#antibullying #bullying #harassment #workplacebullying #stopbullying #metoo #timesup #speakup #justbekind

54,"Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Takumi Nemoto said he will not support a drive to ban dress codes that force women to wear high heels at work.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“It's generally accepted by society that (wearing high heels) is necessary and reasonable in workplaces”, Nemoto said.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Last Monday, members of the #KuToo movement (an amalgam of #MeToo and the Japanese words for shoes, ‘kutsu’ -靴-, and pain, ‘kutsuu’ -苦痛-) submitted a petition with 18,800 signatures to the labor ministry calling for the government to ban companies from requiring women to wear high heels in the workplace, citing health and other issues.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Nemoto added wearing high heels would be an abuse of power if a worker with a hurt foot is forced to wear them.

65,"Unabhängig ihres Herkunftslandes verbinden über 90% der Mädchen und junge Frauen Führungspositionen mit Diskriminierung und sexueller Belästigung! Das zeigt unsere neue Studie „Taking the Lead“. Kein Wunder, dass nur knapp 5% der 500 umsatzstärksten Unternehmen der Welt von Frauen geführt werden und weltweit nur 24% der Parlamentsmitglieder­ weiblich sind. „Die Ergebnisse der Studie sind erschreckend und machen deutlich, dass - wenn wir nicht schnell handeln - Generationen von Mädchen wenig Einfluss auf wichtige Lebensbereiche wie Wirtschaft, Politik oder Gesellschaft haben werden. Deshalb müssen wir die Barrieren abbauen, die Mädchen daran hindern, Führungspositionen zu besetzen“, sagt unsere Geschäftsführerin Maike Röttger.
.

A month ago, I dreaded going to work, I was so anxious and miserable but still I went to work knowing that almost everyone was gossiping about me. At the worst of it I almost gave up and quit and more. I then went on vacation(actually staycation) but just not being at work made a huge difference. When i returned to work, the first day back was pretty bad. But the second day, a person who was with the company for 27 years came up and just started talking to me about random stuff while we worked. And slowly things were that bad anymore. A month later, people are still gossiping but, i now know that I do have some supporters who don't listen and don't care about the gossip. They told me that they know me as a kind, caring, compassionate person. 3 months ago I didn't think I would make it.

87,"Victimhood is not the biggest hindrance to evolution. The attachment to victimhood is the problem. The difference is speaking and noticing your actions. And the other is dwelling in the actions without recognition.
.
The very moment we alleviate the symptoms of victimhood, we will fall “apart”, and the mind will start taking the parts and put them back together. Now we say the mind, we do not mean the existential energy of the mind. But the program, projections and control of how the mind works. Survival does not have to be about packing everything and ready to go. When all you are being asked is to leave the house and create a connection with others.
.
Victimhood is either reaction to the symptoms or creatively see it as a symptom and nothing else. Evolution is yearning nothing to grow. Evolution is happening at this very second in our presence. We just don’t see it because we are created to resume with happiness and joy to see from heart. Our forms are here to deem nothing but enjoy. So, without a doubt our conditions hinder. Our attachments hinder. Never the symptoms. Symptoms are just waiting for you to react not create with it. Deem no worth of it. Continue seeing you are in control of your future without any attachments to what is seeking your symptoms of old realities.
.
You are fantastically enjoying this rooted element called particles, atoms, and light within and out creating abundance and full of grace. So, celebrate life itself, it might surprise you one day and realize, “wow, I thought I was this human condition, but realize I am Love as human form exploring my greatness” and so it is. So, it is.

90,"After experiencing bullying, we can be skittish around people, particularly people we’ve met only recently.
˙
This is a reasonable response: most of us are more careful about locking up the house after we’ve been robbed.
˙
This response can make us more sensitive to comments intended as jokes, or to any feedback.
˙
You may also find that you feel naked when around groups of people, or in small groups where you feel you are going to be asked about your previous experiences.
˙
This can make it attractive to avoid people altogether.
˙
It can be useful to prepare a ‘go to’ for talking about your bullying experience. If you’re in a very new workplace, you can leave it out of the conversation altogether and announce that you moved because you ‘needed a change’.
˙
If you’re in the same workplace and the bullying has been resolved, you can decide whether to deflect and say that you ‘can’t talk about it’ or casually refer to it as ‘a bad patch’.

106,"So I know I posted back in January some of the reasons I subconsciously made myself invisible by gaining a shit ton of weight. I was reminded today. Twice. I can handle men looking. It can even be extremely good for my ego. I can't handle rapey looks, gestures and disgusting comments that make me afraid now to go walking alone. My husband was even with me, both times (same guys) and I think they were trying to provoke a fight. They almost got one. & hes not too confrontational. It really pisses me off. I expect to be able to leave my house, in tight work out clothes & NOT be sexually harassed to the point Im afraid to be out alone. If I were still 200+ pounds, I wouldn't have to deal with this shit. And if anything ever happens to me, I'll get blamed because of what Im wearing, what I posted on Instagram, or what the fuck ever else. I have intentionally made myself look as unapproachable as possible, since I was a teenager. I did it because I would get this uncomfortable harassment and it was my way of self protection. It didnt work. So I gained a shit ton of weight (I didnt want to be looked at). I want to be looked at, respectfully though. Most men I notice looking are not harassing me. This was blatant, rapey behavior. It's the reason I don't want my16 year old out alone. And these guys seem to live on my walking route. I cant go that way anymore. I'll haveto walk past my kids dads & stepmoms house instead and they'll think I'm stalking THEM! Im really fucking upset. I've been sexually harassed by a former employer when I was 17. I had a guy try to force me to have sex with him at 14. I had other similar harassment experiences. I had a boyfriend do some things that I know now were...I don't want to say the r word but we'll say should not have happened because I very clearly said no and stated my limits. That was a long time ago. But it kind of explains my depression and downward spiral and significant weight gain/not wanting to be seen. I'm not going to let some disrespectful assholes ruin all the work I've done to get where I am now. I look good, I should be able to feel good and look good without worrying about being harassed or worse when I leave my house.",workplaceharassment,"|And just because I rant about some disgusting men or because I've had negative, life altering experiences, DOES NOT mean I think all men are disgusting. I can handle myself. Despite my negative early experiences with men and sex, I love men and I love sex (not with men plural but with 1 MAN, singular). But I DON'T like being blatantly harassed. Look all you like. But don't hang your head out the truck, tongue out all sick like, making gestures and gross comments. And then later try to fight my husband because he told you to stop looking at me (like a rapist.) So now I'm worried about running into them alone.

I'm NOT asking for harassment. I can be half naked and not deserve to be made so uncomfortable. And I get looks every time I go anywhere and that doesn't bother me one bit. It's when it crosses a line that should not be crossed. It shouldn't happen to anyone at all, EVER. Obviously I'm worked up now. They succeeded at taking me out of my place of positivity. But I already know what some people would say. ""You know you like it or you wouldn't blah, blah, blah..."" I've heard it all before. Fuck you.",11
107,"Today, out of nowhere, I spoke to a woman who left a job because she was being #mistreated and not listened to after countless attempts at communicating her concerns. She was treated like a slave beneath those in higher power and was overqualified for the position she was in—this is a form of #WorkplaceHarassment. When I told her she did the right thing by not staying in such an environment, she perked up and was grateful that someone else understood what she was going through. After I was #abused and #bullied and blatantly lied to and #belittled to the point of being screamed at in the face for no reason—I guess I know a little something about the subject. If I am meant to help or inspire others with my experiences—I am game!

109,"In late April, the U.S. Supreme Court started to consider two cases that could reshape employment discrimination against LGBTQ workers. As of now if you are working in New Jersey you have legal protection already. But what about everyone outside of the New Jersey area? 🤔
˙
To present a winning case of sexual orientation or gender identity to the courts under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, you can take one of two approaches. If you have direct evidence of discrimination, then you can certainly proceed with a direct case. If don’t – and most folks don’t – don’t worry. You can still succeed with circumstantial evidence. To do so, you need proof of several things. They are:
˙
• That you were a member of a protected class (in other words, you are a lesbian, gay man, trans man, trans woman, etc.)
• That you were qualified for the position you held or for which you applied
• That you suffered an adverse employment action (firing, demotion, reduction of hours, reduction of pay/benefits, assignment to more laborious or more demeaning tasks, etc.)
• That the employer knew or perceived you to be a member of your protected class and took its adverse action because you were a member of that class

115,"*Workplace harassment* It is the belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group of workers. 
Recently, matters of workplace harassment have gained interest among practitioners and researchers as it is becoming one of the most sensitive areas of effective workplace management, because a significant source of work stress is associated with aggressive behaviors at workplace. In Asian countries, workplace harassment is one of the poorly attended issues by managers in organizations. However, it attracted lots of attention from researchers and governments since the 1980s. Under occupational health and safety laws around the world, workplace harassment and workplace bullying are identified as being core psychosocial hazards. Overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and blocking promotions are all considered workplace harassment.

Yes, promoting alcohol to combat mental health may seem odd to some. We aren't asking people not to drink or to use drugs. What we are asking is that people speak up. Talk about their mental health.

137,"REAL TALK...We at Russell were tasked with creating a low alcohol beer for @mindthebarcanada The idea, to help raise awareness surrounding mental health within the hospitality industry. We want to break down the stigma associated with mental health. We want people to openly communicate, to ask for help, to know they are not alone. We have raised over $5000 with this campaign, well on our way to our goal of $10000. These funds will provide therapy sessions to those that are in need. Yes, promoting alcohol to combat mental health may seem odd to some. We aren't asking people not to drink or to use drugs. What we are asking is that people speak up. Talk about their mental health. Reach out. There are people that care and want to help. And that is @mindthebarcanada Together we will change this industry and in the process help thousands of people. Thank you to the 400+ locations and the thousands of individuals for your continued support. Partial proceeds from each 4 pack and keg sold will be donated to Mind The Bar Canada.

147,"Home from work. Finally. Hung up my work keys and went upstairs to kiss and hug my boys and husband. Pierre looked at me while I let out a huge sigh while my shoulders shrugged over feeling so psychologically exhausted.
He knew exactly what I needed. 30 minutes to decompress in the sun with a glass of wine and some liver pâté with a pickle (uhm yes sometimes food heals 🙋🏻‍♀️). ——————————————-———-Coming home absolutely spent has been somewhat of a routine for us this year because I am working, for the first time, in a completely toxic work environment. Living abroad isn’t all wanderlust, wine & cheese and fairies nor is it an extended vacation. Those mental images lack the depth and reality of the human experience and belonging. There are days it’s pure struggle, humility and vulnerability. ————————————————————————I’m talking as openly as possible about it because since I’ve been in this situation I’ve spoken to quite a few people trying to soak up wisdom and advice and I started researching workplace harassment looking for solutions. I’ve learned it is surprisingly common but there is so little written on it and what to do in these situations when you actually enjoy your work and where to go for help. ————————————————————————
I know from experience that it is often these rough and turbulent times that vascularize and oxygenate our resilience muscles. Let us stay strong and never be afraid to talk about our struggle.

I remember when my boss a year ago threatened me with the consequences of talking about my situation of harassment and threats: ""You will see where you get, we are a billion pound company and will spend on lawyers what is necessary, even if they know  that lose the trial, it has already happened in other cases like ... "". One year later, I am still on sick leave due to anxiety and depression, as well as the significant deterioration of my psoriatic arthritis.  I'm awaiting for the judge passes judgement yet.

Before answering the second question from my previous post, I want to show you some of the pictures from my lived experiences.  We have to live the present and feel the many positive moments and peace that daily little things can offer us.  But to deal with situations that generate negative emotions and suffering, one of the tools I try to use is to replace our negative reaction (self-destructive) to harassment by positive emotions from the past.  It is easy to say but difficult to apply. #love #yoga #mindfulness  #mentalhealth #peacefullness #lifelesson #purposeoflife  #workplaceharassment #humanresources #anxietyrelief #anxiety #depression #psoriasis #mentalhealthawareness #psoriaticarthritis #mentalhealthstigma #harassment #mentalillness #positivemindset #positivethoughts #traumarecovery #healing #selfcare #selfacceptance #emotionalintelligence #reducestress #stressless #workhard  #desease  #bullying",workplaceharassment,|Great 😉 👍🏻|I Like it! ❤..,33
203,"Could you work if you suffer from psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis around almost 50% of your skin? 
Yes, you could.  I have suffered psoriatic arthritis in large joints of the upper and lower extremities, distal joints of my hands and feet and sacroiliac joints.  I have been able to do my daily work and develop my profession over the last 25 years.  The first 12 years of the illness were difficult because I had psoriasis almost all my body and I also had outbreaks of psoriatic arthritis occasionally, which hindered the development of my work, but I never had to take a sick leave.  The last 13 years have been easier because the disease was controlled with the new biologic treatments.  I was almost free of disease for 12 years thanks to the new treatments.  Despite this, for the last 25 years I have worked a lot, including almost every weekend. 
With this post I want to encourage all patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis to lead a normal life without complexes despite the disease.  I know that biologic treatments are expensive and not available in all countries.  But after this last year in which my illness has significantly worsened due to a problem of workplace harassment, which led me to suffer anxiety and depression, the response to biologic treatments failed (I have changed 2 times of treatment) and I needed corticosteroids. 
The only way to overcome the situation has been with the support of psychiatric treatment and personal development through yoga, mindfulness and the development of social relationships with my real friends and new people, and of course my family. That change in my life is allowing biologic treatment to work again. I still have a hard situation to overcome ahead, but I discovered another way to live.  I learned to live the present, to feel the little daily things, to try to give love in every things I do. I want to share it with you and encourage people to overcome similar situations with the same or similar methods.  Thank you.

'We had a lot of gay men who talked about sexual harassment both from male colleagues and from female colleagues.' The survey found trans and gender diverse communities experienced sexual harassment differently as the outward presentation of their gender identity changed...

Think about the first day of school, the first day of a new job, undiagnosed illness symptoms, or a relationship that has caused you worry.

No matter how many times you tried to tell yourself ‘Things will be fine’, the worry remained and you felt a little sick to the stomach and had trouble sleeping.

I have been faced with so many life problems most especially my in marriage (home). With my husband and kids it has never been so easy. We have come into conclusions many times about divorce but our both parents won't let us. So I took the step trying to get solution for my home, save myself, my kids and my husband. I came in contact with a prophetess by name Lisa. She told me all I needed to do so I did as she ask, I thought all of it was just another joke not until after three days just as the prophetess said, my husband changed totally for good, fix up himself and apologize to me for everything, stop his night outing, womanising, started his job again and always helping me out in every thing. It came to a point when Terry my son said he now have the best dad in the world. All the positive change affected the entire household because of Lisa the prophetess.

233,"Παρενόχληση στο χώρο εργασίας; Πώς μπορώ να ξέρω;⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Η σεξουαλική παρενόχληση ή η διάκριση στο χώρο εργασίας δεν είναι πάντα εμφανές. Εάν το αφεντικό ή ο προϊστάμενός σου, ζητήσει να ευνοηθεί σεξουαλικά σε αντάλλαγμα την προαγωγή ή αύξηση σου, είναι παρενόχληση. Εάν οι συνάδελφοί σου δημιουργούν ένα εχθρικό περιβάλλον, κάνοντας ακατάλληλα αστεία ή σχόλια με βάση την εμφάνιση, το φύλο, τη φυλή, τη θρησκεία ή την ηλικία σου, αυτό αποτελεί επίσης παρενόχληση στο χώρο εργασίας. ⁣⠀
⁣⠀
-----------------------⁣⠀
⁣⠀
How do I know if I have been sexually harassed or discriminated?⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Not all workplace harassment are obvious. In some cases, it may be difficult to tell if your rights have been violated. If your boss or supervisor requests a sexual favour in return for a promotion or raise, this is harassment. If your colleagues are making inappropriate jokes/comments based on your appearance, sex, race, religion, or age, this also constitutes workplace harassment. ⁣⠀

Thanks for sharing.|From Elementary School, to Middle School, to High School, I was Bullied, until one day a teacher suggested I learn Martial Arts to help gain self confidence and learn how to defend myself. The hardest part of that more than being bullied was taking that first class- that first step!
Eventually the Bullying stopped! 
A Sensei of mine once told me ....
“When you achieve a Black Belt, it does not mean your done learning that Art, whatever Style that may be, It means the real understanding of that style begins !
Martial Arts is a Lifetime of Learning.”
How true was that statement for me! 
Helping a person to overcome the issue of being bullied is important to me because it helps me to overcome the pain of me being bullied and to make peace with it so it does not become an obstacle in my life.
The reward of seeing someone succeed in life is well worth the time invested helping someone!",70
238,"Nurses deserve workplaces that are safe from sexual harassment and abuse: ""In this predominantly female workforce (more than 90 per cent of Australian nurses are female), there is an insidious culture, an unspoken expectation that we will quietly put up with being treated this way. ... Yes, some (but not all!) perpetrators have a disinhibiting condition that might explain their behaviour. But they mostly don't behave the same way in the presence of male doctors or nurses. It's much more likely to happen when the curtains are pulled, or in the bathroom, or when there are no other staff nearby. Which is often.

Despite their condition, these men know how to pick their moment. Part of them still knows when a woman is alone. And it's very rare to hear of female patients with similar conditions sexually harassing people.

This behaviour is not about their condition. It's about a long-entrenched culture of men believing that women's purpose is to provide for their needs, including their sexual needs, whether or not they are interested. It is about men feeling that they can use sex to assert their power."" Read more: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-23/australian-nurses-sexual-harassment-me-too/11032406

249,"Before sending that emoji, 😍 check out this blog from Phillips & Associates on “Emoji sexual harassment”: 👇
˙
Emoji are a set of small images that can be inserted into text messages on smartphones, as well as in emails and social media services like Facebook. Certain symbols have taken on specific meanings. An article in Wired describes the symbols as “a primitive language.” As a result of this, the inclusion of emoji in a text message can convey unintended meanings or plausibly-deniable meanings. Emoji symbols that depict objects that might be considered phallic, such as the corn and eggplant symbols, have taken on that secondary meaning. Even symbols that seem to have obvious meanings, like the “smiley face” emoji, can be subject to multiple interpretations.

259,"You're to forgive others and not to judge. But... what about inappropriate behavior? Are you to turn a blind eye and enable a perpetrator to continue hurting others or even yourself? We're to ""...admonish the unruly"" and Matthew 18:16-17 encourages that ""...if your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses."" So the answer is to never turn a blind eye. We’re to take appropriate action to change inappropriate behavior.⁣⠀",workplaceharassment,"|.⁣⠀

Did you know that the Punjab Commission has installed a 24/7 ☎️ helpline *1043* since August 2014 for women run by women so they can put forward their queries, and make complaints related to harassment, property dispute, violence etc and seek guidance and legal advice? 🙄 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Women in Pakistan face discrimination and harassment at home, workplace and in public, however it goes unnoticed most of the times. And even though Pakistan has made progress in creating the right kind of  environment to empower women through progressive legislation, policies and interventions we still have a long way to go. There are so many obstacles in the way that belittle women, so the government needs to help this section of society by building a more inclusive Pakistan where women are treated as and feel like equals. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Anyway about the helpline, this is how it works. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you want to register a complaint, call the toll free number 1043. They have a [quote] ""team also includes three legal advisors, supervisors and management staff, who will analyze and process your complaints and inquiries on: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- #Workplaceharassment
- #Onlineharassment
- #Genderdiscrimination
- Property disputes and inheritance rights
- #Domesticviolence
- Hostels, day-care centers and other facilities for working women
- Increasing women’s participation in government decision making bodies
- Quota of jobs for women in the public sector
- Skill development
- Changes in employment policies
- Various other economic and social issues ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The team will record your complaints and forward them to appropriate departments for action. The system guarantees the protection of your data and that it will be shared with concerned authorities only."" ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I have been struggling for three months with a coworker who has thrown me so far off my game I am question much of the confidence I spent 5 years building!  Has anyone ever been bullied by being routinely interrogated?  I have come to loathe the word “why” because it is thrown at me so often, demanding me to answer her questioning all under the pretense that she is “just trying to understand” because she isn’t as “skilled as everyone else”. And let me say here.... I absolutely wouldn’t be affected by a kindly toned question of “oh, why did you do it that way” kind of question. Instead every single interaction is met with a biting toned question “WHY did you do it THAT way?” And when I explain my reasons I’m met with the next why question, forcing me to explain further and it continues until I am shook down and unable to calm my defenses.",90

288,"(Part 1) How can we deal with toxic people?  How can we face workplace harassment?  It's hard for me to answer those questions.  I am not a coach or psychologist, just a person who has suffered the consequences of my response to those two situations.  From my experience I will share some reflections.  As I mentioned in previous posts, I had a very hard last year because I suffered anxiety, depression and deterioration of psoriasis (derived from anxiety and the situation of workplace harassment). After a year with psychiatric treatment and with the help of my approach to yoga and mindfulness, I think the first conclusion is very simple, what we all always say, the first thing is health.  To avoid  those two situations do not produce a deterioration of our health, we must understand that what deteriorates health is our response to those situations and not the situation itself.  Obviously it is very difficult to tolerate toxic people and multinational companies that do harassment at work, but we must have the mental resources to face it.  Do not be afraid to ask for external help from professionals like the psychiatrist, to fear of anxiolytics and antidepressants, because they help us to modulate our response to those situations, getting rid of the vicious circle of negative thoughts.  Yoga and Mindfulness techniques help us to better manage our emotions.  We discover another world, our mind in way to feel and our soul, modulating the other part of the mind in way to think (I have to do, I have to answer ...). We learn techniques like meditation that allow you to focus your attention on the present and explore your senses. 
When you suffer the harassment of toxic people you can do two things (part 2). #love #yoga #mindfulness  #mentalhealth #peacefullness #lifelesson #purposeoflife  #workplaceharassment #humanresources #anxietyrelief #anxiety #depression #psoriasis #mentalhealthawareness #psoriaticarthritissucks #psoriasiscommunity #psoriaticarthritis #mentalhealthstigma #harassment #stopharassment #mentalillness #lifequotes #positivemindset #positivethoughts #traumarecovery #healing #selfcare #selfacceptance #soulgrowth #emotionalintelligence",workplaceharassment,|👋👌|I love this pic see bio,24

We are back from a short hiatus to bring you a story from an individual who survived an organization who protected their hostile CEO, even when alerted about patterns of workplace abuse. 
This story illustrates how abuse can flourish even when employees feel empowered to speak up and out.

Today after many, many years and many court days I am heading into the final closing argument of my case. So in the spirit of #mindfulnessmonday I am thinking about my journey that got me here. 😊 I am proud that I stood up for being mistreated by an employer and the system. 😊I am grateful for all the ups and downs of this journey because they have made me strong 😊I am thankful to my circle, my community, my friends, to those who showed me through their actions and support that they stand with me ❤️I am so thankful for all the love in my life 😊I am grateful for my anxiety because it has allowed me to see big pictures, to be empathetic, to see and value all humans beings as being human. #itsok 💪I am proud of this journey no matter what the outcome because I’ve learned to live my life on my terms and I’d rather stand up for what I believe to be right than to be struggling and suffering in silence.  #thankyou #mentalhealthishealth #stand #standup #workplaceharassment #workplacebullying #anxiety #support #friendcircle #love #perspective #life #respectthejourney #respectthejourneyofothers #mindsetiseverything #mindset #respect #wellness #health #employeerights",workplaceharassment,"|Sending lots of light, love and positivity your way ❤️|You got this! 🎉|Courage and bravery|good for you 😊|Best of luck! 👍 Thanks for sharing.

11,"Gina Rushton speaks to Sam Elkin from the St Kilda Legal Service about their survey of LGBTIQ people's experience sexual harassment at work: ""'The survey found lesbian women had experienced heterosexual male colleagues suggesting 'corrective intercourse' to cure them of their lesbianism. 'A real theme was lesbian women talking about sometimes quite frightening experiences they’ve had in the workplace of these so-called jokes,' Elkin said. 'We had a lot of gay men who talked about sexual harassment both from male colleagues and from female colleagues.' The survey found trans and gender diverse communities experienced sexual harassment differently as the outward presentation of their gender identity changed... 'There were reports of these really intrusive questions around genitalia, desire for surgery and relationship status in a way that would clearly be inappropriate if you asked a cis-gendered person those types of questions,' Elkin said.""

I came in contact with a prophetess by name Lisa. She told me all I needed to do so I did as she ask, I thought all of it was just another joke not until after three days just as the prophetess said, my husband changed totally for good, fix up himself and apologize to me for everything, stop his night outing, womanising, started his job again and always helping me out in every thing. It came to a point when Terry my son said he now have the best dad in the world. All the positive change affected the entire household because of Lisa the prophetess.

⁣⠀
Η σεξουαλική παρενόχληση ή η διάκριση στο χώρο εργασίας δεν είναι πάντα εμφανές. Εάν το αφεντικό ή ο προϊστάμενός σου, ζητήσει να ευνοηθεί σεξουαλικά σε αντάλλαγμα την προαγωγή ή αύξηση σου, είναι παρενόχληση. Εάν οι συνάδελφοί σου δημιουργούν ένα εχθρικό περιβάλλον, κάνοντας ακατάλληλα αστεία ή σχόλια με βάση την εμφάνιση, το φύλο, τη φυλή, τη θρησκεία ή την ηλικία σου, αυτό αποτελεί επίσης παρενόχληση στο χώρο εργασίας. ⁣⠀
⁣⠀
-----------------------⁣⠀
⁣⠀
How do I know if I have been sexually harassed or discriminated?⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Not all workplace harassment are obvious. In some cases, it may be difficult to tell if your rights have been violated. If your boss or supervisor requests a sexual favour in return for a promotion or raise, this is harassment. If your colleagues are making inappropriate jokes/comments based on your appearance, sex, race, religion, or age, this also constitutes workplace harassment. ⁣⠀

Thanks for sharing.|From Elementary School, to Middle School, to High School, I was Bullied, until one day a teacher suggested I learn Martial Arts to help gain self confidence and learn how to defend myself. The hardest part of that more than being bullied was taking that first class- that first step!
Eventually the Bullying stopped! 
A Sensei of mine once told me ....
“When you achieve a Black Belt, it does not mean your done learning that Art, whatever Style that may be, It means the real understanding of that style begins !
Martial Arts is a Lifetime of Learning.”
How true was that statement for me! 
Helping a person to overcome the issue of being bullied is important to me because it helps me to overcome the pain of me being bullied and to make peace with it so it does not become an obstacle in my life.
The reward of seeing someone succeed in life is well worth the time invested helping someone!",70
33,"Nurses deserve workplaces that are safe from sexual harassment and abuse: ""In this predominantly female workforce (more than 90 per cent of Australian nurses are female), there is an insidious culture, an unspoken expectation that we will quietly put up with being treated this way. ... Yes, some (but not all!) perpetrators have a disinhibiting condition that might explain their behaviour. But they mostly don't behave the same way in the presence of male doctors or nurses. It's much more likely to happen when the curtains are pulled, or in the bathroom, or when there are no other staff nearby. Which is often.

Despite their condition, these men know how to pick their moment. Part of them still knows when a woman is alone. And it's very rare to hear of female patients with similar conditions sexually harassing people.

This behaviour is not about their condition. It's about a long-entrenched culture of men believing that women's purpose is to provide for their needs, including their sexual needs, whether or not they are interested. It is about men feeling that they can use sex to assert their power."" Read more: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-23/australian-nurses-sexual-harassment-me-too/11032406

44,"Before sending that emoji, 😍 check out this blog from Phillips & Associates on “Emoji sexual harassment”: 👇
˙
Emoji are a set of small images that can be inserted into text messages on smartphones, as well as in emails and social media services like Facebook. Certain symbols have taken on specific meanings. An article in Wired describes the symbols as “a primitive language.” As a result of this, the inclusion of emoji in a text message can convey unintended meanings or plausibly-deniable meanings. Emoji symbols that depict objects that might be considered phallic, such as the corn and eggplant symbols, have taken on that secondary meaning. Even symbols that seem to have obvious meanings, like the “smiley face” emoji, can be subject to multiple interpretations.

Women in Pakistan face discrimination and harassment at home, workplace and in public, however it goes unnoticed most of the times. And even though Pakistan has made progress in creating the right kind of  environment to empower women through progressive legislation, policies and interventions we still have a long way to go. There are so many obstacles in the way that belittle women, so the government needs to help this section of society by building a more inclusive Pakistan where women are treated as and feel like equals. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Anyway about the helpline, this is how it works. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you want to register a complaint, call the toll free number 1043. They have a [quote] ""team also includes three legal advisors, supervisors and management staff, who will analyze and process your complaints and inquiries on: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

83,"(Part 1) How can we deal with toxic people?  How can we face workplace harassment?  It's hard for me to answer those questions.  I am not a coach or psychologist, just a person who has suffered the consequences of my response to those two situations.  From my experience I will share some reflections.  As I mentioned in previous posts, I had a very hard last year because I suffered anxiety, depression and deterioration of psoriasis (derived from anxiety and the situation of workplace harassment). After a year with psychiatric treatment and with the help of my approach to yoga and mindfulness, I think the first conclusion is very simple, what we all always say, the first thing is health.  To avoid  those two situations do not produce a deterioration of our health, we must understand that what deteriorates health is our response to those situations and not the situation itself.  Obviously it is very difficult to tolerate toxic people and multinational companies that do harassment at work, but we must have the mental resources to face it.  Do not be afraid to ask for external help from professionals like the psychiatrist, to fear of anxiolytics and antidepressants, because they help us to modulate our response to those situations, getting rid of the vicious circle of negative thoughts.  Yoga and Mindfulness techniques help us to better manage our emotions.  We discover another world, our mind in way to feel and our soul, modulating the other part of the mind in way to think (I have to do, I have to answer ...). We learn techniques like meditation that allow you to focus your attention on the present and explore your senses. 
When you suffer the harassment of toxic people you can do two things (part 2). #love #yoga #mindfulness  #mentalhealth #peacefullness #lifelesson #purposeoflife  #workplaceharassment #humanresources #anxietyrelief #anxiety #depression #psoriasis #mentalhealthawareness #psoriaticarthritissucks #psoriasiscommunity #psoriaticarthritis #mentalhealthstigma #harassment #stopharassment #mentalillness #lifequotes #positivemindset #positivethoughts #traumarecovery #healing #selfcare #selfacceptance #soulgrowth #emotionalintelligence",workplaceharassment,|👋👌|I love this pic see bio,24

Then, her employer refused to give Kamila the legal benefits that came with her job – but instead offered to marry her if she would become a Muslim, or he would give her the job benefits if she developed physical relationships with him and other officers.⠀

˙
This bullying is generally continuous and is at least predictable: you know that you’re going to feel awful if you see the bully.

However, intentional bullying is more likely to have a purpose (typically, the exit of the target), usually due to the bully’s desire for a different person to be in their team or in a particular position.

114,"I think so. Companies are made by people. The behavior, values ​​and attitude of managers and employees represent the soul, feelings and emotions of a company. Throughout my professional life I have been in several types of companies, small and family, multinationals, public and private sector. In recent years attempts have been made to impose corporate values, theoretically very valid and honest, but generally they are implemented from the top vertically and in many cases without the managers and middle managers setting an example with these values, because they only look for their particular goals and not the general interest. CEOs and Managers must also be brave and remove the toxic people who run departments. But for that, you have to be brave and not look the other way. I have known HR directors who are truly toxic to employees and to the company, but the CEO have continued to maintain them, either because they are used to threaten employees (CEO and managers  are also toxic) or because they look the other way to avoid changes (being CEO and managers cowards). Even now these HR directors are called Directors of People, as a euphemism and hypocrisy of a cowardly attitude of the company. I speak of my experience in two multinational companies in the last 20 years. I know that now there are companies that seek the happiness and well-being of the worker and the managers, not only because they increase productivity, but because they really encourage a happy atmosphere in the company and in the family conciliation. Everything depends on the people who run the company. Please be brave and get rid of toxic people from companies and especially from HR departments. Once a CEO asked me why I took my job so seriously, as if it were something personal. I answered that of course it was something personal, it had an impact on my emotions and feelings, it affected my personal life and I spent most of my time working, as it was not going to be something personal.

121,"Once acknowledged, the bully wound will turn you into a red-faced, empty, emotional puddle.
˙
This is just the start of it. Someone will ask you if you’re OK, and you’re going to feel like crying. You’ll need to make eye contact with someone, and you’re going to feel like crying.
˙
You’ll see a cute cat picture, and you’re going to feel like crying. This isn’t just an elegant moment with a tear or two sliding silently down your face.
˙
It’s going to be red and snotty and difficult to pull back. The only way to stop it will be to think happy thoughts, but don’t make them too happy or you’re just going to start again. Told you.

131,"When we only need to play music for our happiness and share it with people on the street. The most important thing is that whatever we do, we really want to do it  and do it with love. We decide to be happy with our attitude, and doing the things we want to do, regardless of what others think or say. The love we put into our acts, gestures and relationships with others is what will make us happier. We must do things with love and affection, instead of always looking for objectives. Happiness comes from the small acts of everyday life, from the activation of our senses and the elimination of the constant interference of our thoughts of obligation (what I have to do) or negative thoughts (failures, future fears ...). The more love we give to our actions, the happier we will be and the happier we will make others.  #love #psoriasis #mentalhealthawareness #psoriaticarthritissucks #psoriasiscommunity #psoriaticarthritis #mentalhealthstigma #harassment #stopharassment #workplaceharassment  #yoga #mindfulness #anxietyrelief #anxiety #workplaceharassment #depression #love #peacefullness #mentalillness #mentalhealth #love #peacefullness #lifelesson #purposeoflife #lifequotes #positivemindset #positivethoughts",workplaceharassment,"|Hey, that's a gorgeous post!

134,"April is a hard month for me. 
My grandmother’s birthday is on the 15th and in the years since she has passed, I am always consumed by a deep melancholy in the run up to the middle of the month.
But this is also the anniversary month for when Sashe proposed to me, in a manner that was not just unexpected but an absolute harbinger of what our life together was going to be like. It was from that moment that I realised that this was a man, who would move heaven and earth, to offer me a slice of happiness.
So yes, this is a month of loss, and love. 
But it’s also a month that brings quite a bit of change for what I want for myself.
I am going to be looking at leaps of faith, and stretching myself beyond what I think I’m comfortable doing.
And in the process, I will need to dig deep and be braver than I ever have.
In that light, I urge you to have a look at ANTIDOTE: Uncovering Skin and Soul, which is a project by Malaysian artist @ruby.subramaniam 
For 30 days straight Ruby invited 30 diverse women to be painted on their skin, in exchange for their stories. 
I am honoured to be one of those 30 who was invited to her residency at Rimbun Dahan and in due course, you’ll be able to read what I said to Ruby about my identity and being #bodypositive as a Saree wearing person.
The link to the project website is up on my URL, please do bookmark it. 
I’ll let you know as soon as my story is up of course.
Ohh and the beauties that you see in the shot are the resident dogs at Rimbun Dahan who decided to crash the photo shoot and made themselves quite comfortable 😂 I guess there is no running away from being a dog-person 😜",workplaceharassment,"|Waiting waiting waiting.... eagerly !

One of my fave topics to discuss, as an Amazon feminist, is the portrayal of warrior and action women in the media, both regarding their armour/outfits and their roles, plot and characterization. Last year I decided to start a series focusing on the Marvel movies of the MCU, so starting from the beginning and giving a throwback to my first post about Iron Man I.

˙
Bullying is a form of psychological (and sometimes physical) violence, and we see the same mechanisms in play in the schoolyard, in domestic situations and in the workplace.
˙
This is a sustained assault in which no polite attempts to defend yourself work.
˙
We often don’t recognise what we’ve been experiencing as bullying because it begins very subtly. We can get so caught up in trying to manage the situation and avoid anxious feelings that we don’t realise until we catch a break that the environment is so toxic.

154,"By the time a bully has finished with you (or you’ve managed to put the brakes on the situation), your self-confidence is likely to be somewhere around your ankles.
˙
This is what makes you feel on edge all the time, wondering whether you’ve walked in the door the right way.
˙
It makes decisions difficult because you don’t trust yourself, or the bully’s reaction. Because you doubt yourself so much, you start to wonder whether the bully might be right and is just the only person with enough courage to tell it to you straight.
˙
You start running over each decision and interaction of the day in your head (usually when you’re trying to get to sleep) and second-guess your intentions and your abilities. You may also start to blame yourself, and that makes it harder to tell anyone because you think they may take the bully’s side.

I fuelled up the patience tank and set off down the hard road, navigating the crossroads, turning corner after corner making it back to an oasis of self esteem. ALWAYS go with your gut instinct. And NEVER allow someone to bring you into their chaos. But run your own race even its ugly, don’t judge yourself. And you will be a winner in your own eyes.

162,"It's times like this that I'm so thankful for friends like this guy. A few weeks ago a coworker called me a bitch to my face in front of two other employees. I was just informed today that no action will be taken against him and I am now under investigation over a false accusation he made against me in retaliation. I am deeply saddened that even with witnesses this event was so thoroughly swept under the rug. What's worse is I now have to hear about him gloating about how he is untouchable and other choice words he has for me. I cannot believe that this is happening in 2019.

Jokes about “sleeping with the boss” are inappropriate... Often, sexually charged comments, especially when made by people in power, are used to remind a subordinate that they are not safe, that they cannot object, and that their boundaries are not going to be respected. •

165,"Type of Workplace Harassment to be aware of... 👀

Personal Harassment is a form of workplace harassment that’s not based on a protected category (race, gender or religion...).
It is not illegal but can be damaging nevertheless. 
Do you think it's fair that it can happen? Let us know your thoughts 👇

What benefit is it to your mission? Genuinely curious.|@shapiro2 #MeToo sparked a movement and inspired us to do something about workplace misconduct. While the #MeToo movement represents a pivotal moment in corporate America's history it does not provide a solution, a real tool.  Our goal at #NotMe is for people to no longer say ""#MeToo"". Based on our research and work with victims of harassment and psychologists, people want and would prefer to say #NotMe. Hence our choice of name for our brand. Our goal is to eliminate workplace misconduct. While the goal of #MeToo was to expose it.|@shapiro2 We totally agree that #metoo is absolutely about preventing sexual violence. #NotMe is a prevention tool because, in the workplace context,  things generally escalate slowly. It starts with an inappropriate joke or comments, then, for example, an inappropriate image and then it can get physical. #NotMe facilitates the reporting of micro-aggression as well.  Employees do not need (and should not need) to wait for behaviors to be severe and pervasive to report.  By facilitating the reporting (both qualitatively and quantitatively) and by providing employers with the proper tools to intervene early, #NotMe impacts behaviors and helps with prevention.  Not to mention the #NotMe harassment prevention training we also offer. We definitely are on the same team and have the same mission.  Eliminate workplace misconduct so no one ever says ""#MeToo"" again.|👌👍|Nice",89

179,"Last year our petition influenced the Australian Government to vote for an ILO Convention to end violence and harassment in the world of work.

But our job is not done.

ILO negotiations are continuing and some of the world's lowest paid, most vulnerable women are at risk of being excluded from the Convention. It has the potential to ignore informal workplaces, like women working in private homes as maids or nannies, or outside as street vendors, sex workers, and migrant farm workers.

We have an opportunity to ensure the Convention protects everyone, in all forms of work, everywhere.

186,"29-year-old Myat works as a Human Resources Assistant at a handbag factory in Myanmar.

Because of her role in HR, Myat's mobile phone number was made available to staff.

She started received obscene text messages and pictures from an unknown phone number. She had no idea which colleague was sending her the messages and she felt unsafe going to work.

Myat says, “When I saw the first message, I was shocked as it was an obscene text. At that moment, I felt ashamed, afraid and angry ... I felt unsafe as I did not know if this person was near me or not. I was also scared and worried that they might do something to me on my way home from work."" Myat attended training provided by CARE where she learnt that what happened to her constituted sexual harassment, and following the training she felt confident enough to report it.

Women like Myat deserve to be protected at work.

187,"So, no, the bullying didn’t happen because you weren’t paying attention or you were too naïve, or you did something to cause it. 
The behaviour was inappropriate and unreasonable. The only time we expect such behaviour is when trying to wrangle an overtired toddler into bed (or anywhere!). 😄

There is also rarely any way to predict what might be coming. The bully isn’t wearing a sign, and you’re not a poor judge of character just because you don’t have a crystal ball. 
Think about any relationship that has ended, whether it be a romantic one or a friendship: the qualities that have caused you to separate from that person are not the ones that were first evident. 
If you’d seen those qualities first up, you would have been less likely to pursue the relationship. Bullying is the same: if a person’s negative qualities were evident first up, you wouldn’t have stayed there—you’re not silly!

194,"Remember, bullying begins subtly. 
A bully will test you out to see where your boundaries are and how you respond to having them stepped on. 
You need to meet that attempt head on and early. You don’t need to assemble a firing squad. Just use a simple ‘I’ statement or a query about the person’s behaviour. 
It doesn’t have to be on the spot: it can be a little while later, when you’ve had some time to think about how you’ll approach it.

Here are some examples:
• ‘I think you said something earlier about X that seemed a bit negative. Is that how you really think about it?’
• ‘I was concerned earlier when you made that comment about my work because I wasn’t sure if you were serious. Could you please explain what you meant?’
• ‘It feels like you’re more stressed than usual when you’re speaking in meetings. Is everything OK?’

200,"34-year-old Sorya has been working in garment factories in Cambodia for 16 years, in that time she has experienced more than her fair share of sexual harassment at work.

Sorya is the sole earner in her family. Her husband is a stay-at-home dad and looks after their three children aged 6, 12, and 15. The whole family depends on her. So no matter how much sexual harassment she experienced from her colleagues, she still had to go to work. 
When CARE brought its Enhancing Women’s Voice to Stop Sexual Harassment (STOP) project to Sorya’s workplace, things changed. Sorya says, “Before there was no sexual harassment policy in my garment factory at all, but now we have one after CARE engaged with us. It helps us solve issues quickly. Workers now feel safe and secure because they can depend on the policy and other people.” Sorya is committed to stopping sexual harassment in her workplace, and now trains others in what is acceptable behaviour and the importance of reporting harassment.

.
We all might have seen or read about people complaining how they’re harassed at workplace. It might be mental or sexual harassment. Harassment has become very common these days and very few people raise their voice against this. The fear of losing job, management politics, inefficient top management are few of the reasons for this. Why do they think that it’s okay to trouble others and disturb their mental health? It doesn’t happen because of a single reason. Those who harass will be having multiple reasons or motives behind their actions. One of them is hierarchy in the organisational setup.
.
I have been working in corporate setup for almost three years now and I’ve seen workplace harassment at multiple levels. One of the managers in my organisation has the habit of stereotyping women. He is against women working, especially after marriage. I've seen him personally talking to women in an unprofessional manner. He asks them questions about their menstruation and personal life which is ethically wrong. I've seen him mentally harassing people by forcing them to do things which they do not wish to do. He tries to know everything about others' personal lives. Sometimes people will be forced to share this information even if they are not comfortable to get their leaves approved. And the senior management has remained silent even after raising concerns by multiple employees, just because that person has been working in the company from many years and so management trusts him more than other employees. This type of behaviour from management spoils the working environment. It also mentally disturbs the victims, which in turn affects the performance of those employees. I've seen this happening around me. At times it has also affected their personal lives, because at the end of the day if the mind is disturbed then it also disturbs other things in life.

218,"Alicia was just 14 years old when she packed her bags and moved from the Andean mountains in Ecuador to work as a nanny, cook and maid for a family in Colombia.

Alicia's employers would deny paying her as a cruel form of control and to coerce her into having sex with the men in the family.
When she denied them sex, the abuse only got worse.

Alicia’s story is harrowing, but it’s not uncommon. Across Latin America, 1 in 4 women earning a  wage work in someone else's home, and only 10% of them have a legal contract.  This leaves them completely vulnerable to harassment in the workplace.

223,"The Fuss over Aurat March
In response to the #auratmarch2019, men decided to hold a #mardmarch. It is a pity that men feel the need to strike back #menstrikeback when women ask for their rights. Men need to understand, #feminism doesn't equal hatred for men. It was against #patriarchy, not against men. It’s sad that a few individual placards, reflecting individual opinions, were all that these men saw.
I was also saddened by the way most people, including a lot of women, reacted to some of the placard slogans, the simplest and least offensive of which was ""khana khud garam kar lo"". In return women are being asked to shop with their own money. Isn't that exactly what we are asking for? Yes please! give us that kind of financial independence,  that would enable to shop with our own money. That kind of financial independence starts with good health, good education, good upbringing, no workplace harassment, equal pay, equal respect. Yes, that's what we're asking for when we ask you to heat up your own food. We're asking for empowerment to shoulder part of your responsibilities when you shoulder some of ours. 
I saw so many women voicing their concerns and dislike for the kind of placards displayed, terming them vulgur, anti-men, and against our religion. The statement these placards made were taken too literally, ignoring the underlying message. The sarcasm, the hit on our double standards was completely ignored. 
Hypocrisy, double standards, subtle or blatant subjugation of women places a barrier on their journey to being equal humans and equal citizen, it intensifies problems of equal opportunities and equal pay, it hinders their right to education and a safe workplace. Hypocrisy and double standards play as big a role, as honor killings, only it is worse because there is no dead body, no mayhem and it is not a crime punishable by law. Maybe the only way to put a stop to it is through controversial placards.

Society still sees Nary’s job as ‘a bad job for a bad woman’. She doesn’t dare to speak about her job to her neighbours due to this discrimination. Her own family doesn’t recognise her job either.

Everyone, in all forms of work, deserves to be safe from sexual harassment. Sign our petition and stand with women like Nary. www.caretoact.org.au

234,"It’s International Women’s Day in a couple of hours, in my part of the world at least.
If I’m being honest, I don’t totally buy into the celebration. Yes, I accept that merit needs to be recognised and maybe documented; as a television content producer, even I am a part of this.
But the overwhelming spotlight towards women once a year leaves an odd taste in my mouth.
I know I’m going to sound ungrateful if I don’t acknowledge my right to vote (because I had to bloody earn it I’m the first place) or the fact that I can now report rape as a crime in my country (ohh wait, only if I’m not married to my perpetrator).
I work in an industry that is male dominated but I try and achieve balance.
I write about issues that many think affect only women but in truth impact society as a whole.
I’m feeling jaded, because we talk about women’s rights and human rights and children’s rights, and yet, day after day, I hear stories of girls and women being marginalised and discriminated against BECAUSE of their gender.
I know all negativity takes a great big pause tomorrow as we mark #iwd2019; all i want is for the world to wake up on the 9th of March and recognise that we STILL need to work towards #balanceforbetter ❤️",workplaceharassment,"|#womensupportingwomen #genderequality #beyou #beyourself  #empowerment #selfempowerment #feminist #feminism #selflove #confidence #antibullying #saynotobullying #breakthesilence  #empoweringgirls #empoweringwomen #empoweredwomen #stopsexualharrasment #sexualharrasment #sexualassault #workplacebullying #workplaceharassment #speakup #standupforyourself #standupforyourrights #sareesandstories #iwd #internationalwomensday|This is exactly what I’m feeling right now too.

245,"➡ El artículo 164 de la LOTTT, define el acoso laboral como el hostigamiento o conducta abusiva ejercida en forma recurrente o continuada por el patrono o la patrona o sus representantes; o un trabajador o una trabajadora; o un grupo de trabajadores o trabajadoras, que atente contra la dignidad o la integridad biopsicosocial de un trabajador, una trabajadora o un grupo de trabajadores y trabajadoras, perturbando el ejercicio de sus labores y poniendo en peligro su trabajo o degradando las condiciones de ambiente laboral. Sin embargo, en atención a la doctrina del mobbing laboral, se ha precisado que se requiere de reiteración de la conducta abusiva u hostigamiento, pero dicha reiteración puede ser sustituida por la gravedad la conducta.

246,"Spoiler Alert: Brooklyn Nine Nine, 6×08.

This show never fails to disappoint. Repeatedly they've addressed issues that matter with sensitive well timed comic relief, proving the fine line between comedy and mockery.

This still is from the latest episode, 'He Said, She Said'. Not only does the episode explore sexual harassment in the workplace, it also brings to light how rampant it is and how ignorant men are of it, despite their best effort due to its targeted nature.

It explores how women can stick up for each other despite differences and displays how men can be healthy helpful and supportive allies.

It realistically highlights two sides of speaking up and coming forward, while acknowledging regardless of support or lack of it, it's always a difficult experience. Yet, I don't think it's triggering at the least.

By the end of those 21 minutes, there's a sense of empowerment and solidarity despite the bleak, horrifying reality that sexual abuse and harassment is.

It's so insightfully and sensitively done. It touches upon the little things, paints a full picture without taking anything away from the core issue.

248,"When I was a young adult, I had a hard time saying ‘No’. I was always afraid of hurting people’s feelings, or damaging relationships, or even seeming ungrateful, if I didn’t acquiesce to almost every (within tentative reason) request that came my way.
I used to hear out tele-marketers to the end of their spiel, agree to watching movies that I had absolutely no interest in and even ended up mellowing my stand in arguments to mitigate conflict.
Those were some of the most miserable years of my life.
Thankfully, since then, I’ve successfully learned the art of saying ‘No’ when it comes to situations that I do not want to participate in. And to be clear, I’m specifically referring here to communications between adults.
There seems to be a perception that saying ‘No’ immediately paints you up as a rude person. That you are cutting someone down, and being unfair and ultimately selfish, by issuing a refusal.
Now all of this might be true, but it is also possible, that you are saying ‘No’ to something, because you do not feel like doing it.
At this point, the person whom you have said ‘No’ to has the option of accepting your answer, or trying to change your mind.
And you’ve always got to ask, WHY are they trying to change your mind. 
Perhaps they think you don’t know better, and that if you agreed with them, your life would have added value.
Or, perhaps they need you to agree to their request to make themselves feel better.
Is there a third reason? I’m sure there are many, many more.
But I for one, feel that the only reason that matters, is why you said ‘No’ in the first place.
The question is, does the person you’re communicating with respect you enough to honour your ‘No’?
And if you’re the person who won’t take ‘No’ for an answer, are you willing to accept that you may be forcing someone to bend their will?
Ohh, it’s not so serious, I’ve heard people scoff. If you don’t want to do something, just don’t do it.
I can do exactly that now that I’m older and wiser. 
But what about those who feel beholden to louder voices?
Who will hear their ‘No’?",workplaceharassment,"|#metoo #metoomovement #metooindia #metoomalaysia #timesup #womensupportingwomen #genderequality #beyou #beyourself  #empowerment #selfempowerment #feminist #feminism #selflove #confidence #antibullying #saynotobullying #breakthesilence  #empoweringgirls #empoweringwomen #empoweredwomen #stopsexualharrasment #sexualharrasment #workplacebullying #workplaceharassment #speakup #standupforyourself #standupforyourrights #sareesandstories #minisareestories|Did you assume asking for help in choosing a saree amounts to not treating you as a human?

It's important to balance life out with some 'no's' for when the 'yes' comes it will be well worth it!|This resonated so deeply! When you learn to say no you begin to weed out the unimportant or that which may not be healthy for your well being, and make space for the truly important and meaningful things which then result in your life being a lot richer and fuller.

As shitty as it is to have what’s happening go on, it’s encouraging to know that I can speak up and feel safe in doing so.
.
Didn’t help that I was kind of down to start with as the only person on site I really spoke to left last night and this morning just made me feel really alone out here. Four weeks into a five week swing, I’m missing my pup and my own bed, all I want is a hot shower (my room doesn’t have hot water unless I shower in the middle of the day, which I can only do on RDO). Feeling really deflated by it all and have cried a couple of times but I know this too shall pass and by this time next week I’m going to be on an amazing high! Gotta have the downs to value the up and what an up it’s going to be... Fresh ink, a trip to Sydney, Download Festival and upskilling for a better future 👌🏼🖤🙌🏼
.
So to sum up, yeah things are fucking hard today, my mind is tired and my heart feels cold, it maybe the last day of summer getting to me too like it always does, but I know if I just focus on what I have coming up and my goals that I can take anything that gets thrown at me.

267,"There are not many films that fell relevant and right 25 years after their release. But Magalir Mattum is one such gem.

A comedy that tackles the sensitive issue of sexual harassment at workplace, is all the more relevant now, in the wake of the #MeToo movement in India, than it has ever been.

Celebrating the silver jubilee, Urvashi, the lead actor shared how Magalir Mattum was ahead of its time and spoke of workplace harassment and the male gaze. “To produce a project that tells the story from a woman’s point of view was an audacious attempt. And, he (Kamal Haasan) selected actresses who are not known for their glamorous roles,” said Urvashi crediting Kamal Hasan and  Singeetham for the movie's success.

286,"“I was 24 years old when I came to NYC to become an actress. I took a job as a waitress in a diner in Queens. There I encountered so much harassment from males that I can’t remember all of it. From nasty customers telling me all kind of things, getting offers to be in threesomes with their wives, the cooks asking me very personal things like “Do you shave down there? Do you have it like a baby?”, getting compliments or nasty comments everytime I would go to the kitchen. 
But, this is where it gets worse. My boss, the manager, often would pass by in the very tight kitchen and touch my boobs and my ass. I was so nervous every time he did that. I didn’t know what to do. I would laugh nervously and pretend it didn’t happen. He would do it anytime his girlfriend, who was also working there, wasn’t around. This lasted about a year, until I spoke to the owner and said that I will sue him for harrasment. The owner fired him and told me not to sue anybody. So I left that job. I cried so much everyday, feeling impotent and guilty with fear that he would do something to me one day. Also, I found out that I wasn’t the only one going through that. My coworkers, who were immigrants, were afraid to talk because they didn’t have papers and were afraid of being deported.” - @malena.ramirez
