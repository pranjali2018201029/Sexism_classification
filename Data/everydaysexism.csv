All the vile messages have come from people I didn’t speak to first. Often the second messages look like they’re in response to me replying to the guys... but it’s just their rage at seeing that I’m online or have read their message and not replied. Communicating with them seems futile.. either they’re trying to annoy me into responding then trying to Segway into lets fuck.

""To say the last couple of weeks around here have been intense, would be an understatement. ⁣🤯
⁣
Has anyone else felt like this September didn't feel like a *normal* September? Instead of nestling into a cozy new routine our has felt swift, transformational, and full of discomfort and lots of learning. But all of it is teaching us and we are actively listening.⁣ ♥️
⁣
Last week we installed our very first piece of REAL food manufacturing equipment at our newest social enterprise bakery, an organization called Stone Hearth Bakery in Halifax, NS. This packaging line will be an epic timesaver and also change the look/feel of our packaging (which I admittedly have slightly mixed feelings about...but more on that later). ⁣😂
⁣
With these investments we are building the capacity and skills capabilities of our social enterprise partners as we all 'level up' together. Committing to growing in partnership with social enterprises as manufacturing partners is an innovative model and really we've seen, there's no existing roadmap. ⁣😳
⁣
It's challenging and exhilarating and seeing the impact that our partnerships have on these community-led organizations reminds that I have no interest in building this purpose-led company in any other way. Because our food's more than about the food. ⁣

We've got social impact, baked-in.✨"" 💜

Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic infection after malaria. It's treatment is quick, cheap and easy but it's still horribly neglected and FGS especially has been largely ignored and unknow. One can't help but wonder if this is because it affects women, and specifically women in poverty. 👩

56,56,"""Letztens war ich in einem Park mit einem riesigen Spielplatz. Es waren sehr viele Schulklassen aus allen Altersstufen da und ich saß auf einer Bank und schaute dem Trubel zu. Ich beobachtete zwei Burschen, um die 13 Jahre alt, wie sie sich suchend umschauten. Dann entdeckten sie das Mädchen, das sie offensichtlich suchten und der eine Bursch sagte laut: „Da ist sie ja, die dumme Hure.“ Die Reaktion des Mädchens verriet mir, dass das nicht das erste Mal gewesen war, dass jemand sie so angesprochen hatte. Sie reagierte kaum und die drei Kinder gingen zusammen weiter Richtung Streichelzoo. Im Nachhinein weiß ich garnicht, was mich am meisten schockiert - die Aussage des Burschens oder die Reaktion des Mädchens. Offensichtlich haben beide Kinder gelernt, dass solche Aussagen nicht schlimm, banal, normal sind. Ich wünsche mir, dass genau diese Themen in Schulen angesprochen werden, von Anfang an. Kindern muss die Macht von Worten bewusst sein, sie müssen lernen sich zu wehren, laut zu sein und „Stopp!“ zu sagen - sonst werden sie als Erwachsene kaum können.""⁠

In this ground-breaking investigation, Laura traces the roots of extreme misogyny across a complex network of online groups extending from Men's Rights Activists and Pick up Artists to Men Going their Own Way, Trolls and the Incel movement, in the name of which some men have committed terrorist acts. 
Seeing boys and men groomed and radicalised to adopt an extreme and misogynistic mindset, Laura has spent months drawing parallels with other extremist movements around the world, seeking to understand what attracts men and boys to the movement, how it operates and considers what can be done. Most urgently of all, Laura traces the pathways this extreme ideology has taken from the darkest corners of the internet to emerge covertly in our mainstream media, our playgrounds and even our parliament.

.
Self censorship brought to you by Instagram, but truly enforced by societies fucked up ideals! Sometimes I feel absolutely invisible only up and to the point of objectification. Censorship takes a toll on your psych, on your physical wellbeing. As sex workers we are constantly excluded from conversations about our work and as human beings we are othered and aliened from general “society.” .
.
Even as said society worships our ideals, I find myself exhausted and run down more than I care to admit. Shame, stigma, fear, violence all of the destructive and abusive interactions can be boiled down to the fact that we do not allow ourselves to have a nuanced perspective on our own sexuality. We project! We Attack those we wish to emulate! I can’t even count how many times I was taught and did enforce sexism and self censorship myself in my younger days.
.
.
My sexuality and my body (nude or not) gives me strength, and power, and people seek out my time to bask in that energy. Constantly making me censor my own body only reminds me of how dangerous the world see’s me. This fear allows them to take away our rights and demonize our actions while they continue to see us in private. This post is all over the place because I am venting, and feeling sad after a bad shift. .

.
Livre magnifiquement écrit par Olivia Gazalé, qui aborde l'origine de la misogynie, du sexisme, du viriarcat, de l'oppression de la femme par l'homme...etc. à travers l'analyse de textes de l'Iliade, de textes religieux, de la littérature française ou encore de discours politiques. .
Un livre  intéressant et engagé qui permettra à certain(e)s de deconstuire le mythe qu'ils/elles se font de la virilité et les aidera à être de véritables soutiens dans la lutte contre le sexisme.
.
🇬🇧I only have 100 pages left to read 👍.

I do  not know if you can find this amazing book in english, but if you can, do so. The author explain to us the origins of sexism, misogyny using political discourses, religious texts...etc. reading  this book can be a good way for men to become  allies against sexism✊

The past year of my life has been consumed by a project that has felt urgent, terrifying and shocking. It has been really strange to be immersed in a world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women, to see boys being deliberately groomed and radicalised and to trace the ideology and messaging I was finding deep online right through our mainstream and media and into our politics and homes, all without much mainstream awareness at all that this is happening. I’m both excited and scared about this book coming out and will really appreciate any support as I am already starting to experience what I know will be a massive backlash from the communities this book aims to expose. If you think you might like to read it, pre-orders make a massive difference to authors as they help persuade booksellers to stock the book - link in my bio

106,106,"Shannon Maley had a seeming vendetta against a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities who was dating her sister. She barely knew him, yet claimed he sexually assaulted her and her friends. Maley then created multiple social media accounts under the young man’s name and sent herself disturbing and threatening messages in order to frame him. She has since pleaded guilty to “perverting the course of justice and also to harassing witnesses,” The Daily Record, a UK news publication reports. The young man, who will not be named by because he is the victim and will instead be referred to as John Doe, told the Record he was on the brink of suicide until he was acquitted last November on five charges of sexual assault. The outlet reported that he “sat on the ledge of his 14th-storey flat window seriously contemplating whether life was worth living because of the vicious lies that had ‘destroyed’ him.” Maley’s messages to herself included threats “to set you on fire and watch you burn alive” and claims that John was “not going to stop causing you pain.” Maley had apparently intimidated her friends into making accusations against John as well. One of those friends eventually admitted that the young man had not sexually assaulted her and that Maley had harassed her and tried to influence their testimony at John's trial. John was also accused of sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls who were also allegedly friends of Maley. A witness explained that John didn’t do what he was accused of doing, leading to acquittal on those charges. Maley’s story unraveled after she accused John of sending a threatening message while he was in prison without access to the Internet. No reason has been given for Maley’s vendetta against John, and the young man still fears for his safety. ""It feels like Shannon Maley has destroyed my life.

These allegations benefit no one except for the people using them.|Oh man this is fucked up from start to finish.

More info:
For this Dutch Design Week, Joes + Manon, a social design studio based in Eindhoven, put sexuality on the menu. Literally. They host a series of experience dinners in which they question norms and behavior in the context of sexuality.
During the dinner Joes + Manon will serve some of the challenges and opportunities within sexuality. As dinner guest you can expect an interactive experience in which the conversation about the topics is facilitated in an original and surprisingly delicious way. The orgasm gap will be cut away, taboos will be spiced up and stereotypes will be made into pulp. The experience dinners show the constructive and positive role of design in debating difficult and intimate subjects. The dinner is designed in close collaboration with Petra Tiemessen, Seksuologen in Spé and Rutgers, the Dutch authority on research & sexuality. Also, we are very happy to collaborate with designers Thieu Custers, Nienke Helder en Circus Engelbregt.",everydaysexism,"|.

#ICHPhotography: How many of you love capturing the varied expressions while travelling in a train in India?

@riddhi_parekh's brilliant photoshoot ""The Train story"" will show you the different thoughts, emotions, expressions & atmospheres you go through during a night in the train. "" As we entered we realized we were amongst the only three ladies out of five in the UP filled gang of men. With only two seats reserved and rest on RAC we started preping for our shoot in this over crowded train. The challenges were unforseen of course. Viji and Rebekah had to stand next to the smelly toilets to iron and curl the hair as that was the only working electrical point, also wait for the train to stop to put a correct eyeliner and change in the cramped toilets.
After all the craziness we did manage to start the shoot and boy it was a joy. ""

Last picture: typical stereotype female,ä.
This picture: more uncommon, strong looks due to the cosplay.
.
I've made the experience, the more stereotype female pictures I post, the more popular they are on this platform.
I want to hear what you think about this. What could be a possible explanation? Is sexism still present everywhere?
As you know I am not backing up from difficult topics, so I ask you to not be shy and do the same, tell me your experiences/ thoughts/opinions on this topic :)
.
In Kontrast zum letzten Bild, das mehr dem stereotypen Frauenbild entspricht hier ein starkes Frauenbild von mir im KDA Akali Cosplay. Ich habe die Erfahrung gemacht, je mehr das Bild dem Stereotyp entsprach, desto besser kam es an. Daher frage ich mich,  woran das denn liegt? Ist sexismus so omnipräsent? 
Ich würde gerne eure Gedanken dazu hören. Wie ihr wisst scheue ich mich auch nicht davor, kritische Themen anzusprechen. Ich bitte euch, das auch zu tun. Sagt mir doch mal eure Erfahrungen/Meinungen/Gedanken zu dem Thema :)

If a man can’t appreciate a woman’s strength, he’s not a man. For me, I’m always mindful of the compliments and comments I give people. Telling women and men different things (like women are pretty vs men are confident or smart) pushes the same sexist ideas even if you’re a ‘’well meaning’’ person. We all have to be conscious about how we contribute to the problem before we can be part of the solution.|Ich find dich auf beiden Bildern sehr hübsch und auch sexy!

Yes, sexism will be ever present, because we are different.  How many courts, all things being considered equal, give children to the father?  Not many, at least here in America.  We (men and women) are different.

149,149,"“Also, meine Geschichte ist von letztem Jahr. In meiner Schule hatten wir einen ziemlich sexistischen Lehrer. Er hat öfter unsere Sportstunden übernommen und ist dabei immer ""unabsichtlich"" in die Umkleidekabine gekommen und hat uns allen auf die Brüste gestarrt. Während dem Turnunterricht hat er uns immer mit den Jungs verglichen und jeden Satz mit, ""...dafür das du nur ein Mädchen bist..."" begonnen. Die schlimmste Situation war aber nicht im Turnunterricht. Meine Partnerklasse hatte ihn in einem anderen Fach und bei einer Schularbeit hat er einem Mädchen, das fast die ganze Punktzahl hatte, und somit eigentlich einen Einser, einen Fünfer gegeben, mit dem Grund das er sich nicht vorstellen kann, dass ein Mädchen das kann und sie bestimmt von ihrem Sitznachbar abgeschrieben hätte. Zum Glück wurde er gefeuert, nachdem sich mehrere Schülerinnen und Eltern bei der Direktion beschwert hatten.”⁠

She’s asking for it when: ⁣⁣
- she’s dressed in “revealing” clothing;⁣⁣

- she’s worked for years trying to make a career for herself and is in a meeting with her superior hoping for her next big break;⁣⁣

- she returns a smile to someone across the room, while sitting with friends at the bar;⁣⁣
- she owns the dance floor when she’s on it, her body one with the music; ⁣⁣
- she kisses someone after the first/second/seventh date; ⁣⁣
- she walks home alone after work;⁣⁣
- she paints her nails with a special nail polish that helps determine if her drink has been spiked;⁣⁣
- she’s home with an acquaintance / a new partner / a long-time spouse; ⁣⁣
- she walks down the street, goes to the gym, goes for a coffee, does her grocery shopping, goes to the beach, plays sport, stands still, walks fast, when she’s alone, when she’s with friends, in the morning, at night. ⁣⁣

Every single time she is absolutely asking for it! Without fail. Guaranteed. ⁣⁣

⁣
What she IS asking for is to have the safety and freedom to go about her life without the threat that she will be verbally, physically, emotionally or sexually harassed and abused in some way. ⁣
⁣
She IS asking to be taken seriously for being intelligent, strong, capable and talented.⁣
⁣
She IS asking to be seen for more than her body parts, more than a sexual object, more than a thing. ⁣
⁣
She IS asking for the simple respect that should come with her being a human being. ⁣
⁣
Women have to work so hard for all these things, because they are *still* not a given. Indeed, they’re often blatantly withheld from them, violently denied and murderously extinguished. ⁣
⁣
To be clear: ⁣
⁣
Women are not asking to live their life wondering if what they’re wearing will be considered the “wrong thing” in a court of law. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to walk home at night tightly clutching pepper spray or fashioning car keys into weapons between their fingers. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to be catcalled, felt up, harassed, followed home, stalked, threatened, abused, raped, murdered. ⁣
⁣
They’re not asking to be called liars because it can take years to find the courage to call out their harasser.|(... continued 2) ⁣
⁣
Maybe it’s time we stop blaming the women of the world; as though they are to blame for not behaving in the ways that would keep them safe. Let’s stop pointing the finger at them each and every time they are harassed, raped and murdered simply for risking to walk out of their front door - and, often, not even having to do that! ⁣
⁣
Disgraced “comedian” Louis C. K. once did a stand up about how unsafe women are in the world (and should expect to be unsafe), simply for the fact that they are women. He said that it was a given that women would be harassed because they are women. And he laughed and laughed! I did not. I found it disgusting, degrading and extremely non-humorous. That’s a vile view to hold of women. ⁣
⁣
We need to continue to shine light on the system that propagates its misogynistic views and supports the violence and violations against women. ⁣
⁣
We ARE asking for it. We are asking for respect and the right to live a life of safety and freedom that is not only our human right, but our very birth right! ⁣|....................................

Innsender legger til at hun hadde i profilteksten ""Er ute etter noe seriøst - fuckboys sveip videre!"" og uansett om begge kun er ute etter sex bør man allikevel respektere den man vil ligge med, som et menneske og ikke bare et objekt. Gutten får svar på tiltale! Legg merke til at denne Marius ikke bryr seg om hva innsender vil, men durer på med hva han vil - _på bekostning av å undertrykke henne og redusere hun til et objekt_. Det er også ganske trist at jenter må minne menn på at de har en mor eller søster de sannsynligvis respekterer, og at ""normen"" blandt mange menn i samfunnet er at de ikke respekterer kvinner som kjønn, kun sine nærmeste. Da har man ikke et greit kvinnesyn selvom enkelte av de liker å skryte på facebook 8 mars av at de har det! 🙄 Har du historier å dele?

166,166,"Pretty: “pleasing or attractive to the eye, as by delicacy or gracefulness”... This “cute” girls’ PJ set is currently available in Asda. Are we REALLY still peddling the message that a girl’s role in life is to look pleasing to the eye and delicate in nature?  If we prize outwards appearance over personality or actions,  we are not encouraging our girls to have their own unique personality, but rather to be pretty, demure and passive. 
We teach them that we value their looks above anything else about them. 
We teach them to create a false self and to people please. 
Ultimately, we teach them low self-esteem. 
Why then are we surprised when they start wearing make up and heels at 5, are dieting by 9 and having cosmetic surgery in their teens?

Low self esteem and body dissatisfaction creeps in early and this kind of slogan only adds to the toxic messaging. We have approximately 171,476 words in the English language, can’t we do better than “look pretty”? In the meantime, Asda, I fixed it for you.

167,167,"""Vor einigen Wochen habe ich alleine Urlaub in Spanien gemacht und wollte mich in Sevilla in einen Park lesen und in Ruhe ein Buch lesen. Es war ein sonniger Nachmittag und ich habe mich eher in einen ruhigeren Teil gelegt. Einige Meter entfernt, in Sichtweite waren noch zwei weitere Frauen, die sich ausgeruht haben und in der Ferne konnte ich auch noch weitere Familien mit ihren Kindern spielen sehen. ⁠
Irgendwann hat mich ein junger Mann, etwa 20+ Jahre, nach einer Zigarette gefragt. Als ich ihm mitteilte, dass ich nicht rauche, wollte er mich weiter in ein Gespräch vermitteln, mit Fragen wie: „Was machst du hier? Woher kommst du? Bist du alleine hier?“ Abweisend und widerwillig habe ich geantwortet und meine knappen Lügen so formuliert, dass er mich in Ruhe lässt. ⁠
Als ich dachte er lässt mich in Ruhe kehrte er zurück, und im Herkommen holte er seinen Penis heraus und begann damit zu spielen. Schockiert fand ich kaum Worte und noch weniger auf Englisch. Ich setzte mich rasch auf, er kam immer näher auf mich zu, grinste mich stolz an und machte solange weiter, bis ich etwas lauter wurde und ihm mehrmals angeschrien habe, er solle verschwinden. ⁠
Schockiert, wusste ich gar nicht was ich tun sollte und blieb noch kurz sitzen. Plötzlich kam er zurück und masturbierter weiter, bis ich des Öfteren lauter wurde und meinte ich würde die Polizei rufen, da mir nichts Besseres einfiel. Leider waren andere Menschen zu weit weg um die Situation mitzukommen. Immer noch entsetzt rief ich eine Freundin und als ich mich nach kurzer Zeit umdrehte, sah ich ihn hinter einem Busch stehen und weiter machen. ⁠
Wütend, machtlos, überfordert und hilflos packte ich meine Sachen und verlies den Park. Die einzige Erinnerung an diese wunderschöne Stadt, bleibt für mich dieses furchtbare Ereignis.""⁠

171,171,"🇫🇷 En ce moment, en France, il y a une crise de sexisme: 113 féminicides depuis le 1er janvier 2019 dans l’indifférence absolue du gouvernement et de la presse. Le féminicide est défini sur Wikipedia comme «le meurtre d’une ou de plusieurs femmes ou filles en raison de leur condition féminine, c'est à dire en raison de leur identité de genre. ». Ce 25 septembre, Sandra Muller, la journaliste à l’origine du #balancetonporc comparaissait en justice pour diffamation contre Éric Brion, l’homme qu’elle avait accusé de harcèlement sexuel dans son tweet. Il lui demandait 50000€ de dommages et intérêts, 10000€ de frais d’avocat et la suppression de son tweet. Le tribunal a heureusement considéré Mme Muller comme innocente, mais le fait que la question se pose prouve que nous sommes loin de la victoire sur les violences sexistes.
.
🇺🇸 [First image: “she leaves him he kills her”, second image: “we are the 10/02/2019. Since the 1st of January, 113 women were murdered by their partner or ex-partner”] Right now, in France, we are in a sexism crisis: 113 feminicides since the 01/01/2019 in the complete indifference of the government and the media. A feminicide is defined as “the murder of one or several women or girls because of their feminine condition, in other words because of their gender identity” This September 25th, Sandra Muller the journalist who created the #balancetonporc (later recreated in the English speaking world as the #MeToo), was in court because Eric Brion, the man she accused of sexual harassment sued her for libel. He was demanding 50000€ for damages, 10000€ for lawyer charges and the removal of the tweet. The court thankfully found her innocent but the fact that she was in court proves that it’s far from given, and that we are far from the victory on sexist violences.

175,175,"When people tell me feminism isn't relevant any more I have to take a long sharp breath. I could write a list as tall as I am with reasons why it's still 150% necessary. Working in pregnancy and birth, this terrain is where I see in minute detail the ways that unequal power-structures constructed around sex and gender are affecting every single woman and birthing person that engages in maternity services
.
One reason some clients have worked with me is because they're feeling powerless and stuck in their pregnancies. Maternity appointments leave them feeling lost and overwhelmed - a hot, sweaty mess. In the rest of their lives they're totally bossing it. They speak up in what they're passionate about, make important and difficult decisions, call things out, direct the way things run – in their personal lives and in their work
.
.
But there's something about pregnancy that leaves women feeling condemned to having no voice and no control. That's because maternity services and the birth-room is the place where rampant sexism, lack of consent, control over women's bodies and attempts to keep women in line all collide into one big microcosmic clusterfuck of the world around us. It's where the patriarchy rules. Every constructed belief and barrier that's been used to keep women in their place rears it's big ugly head here
.
.
So it's no wonder this is how pregnant women are feeling when they're treated like inept little girls who couldn't possibly know what's good for them and their babies. Who need to be told what to do and put back into their place if they dare step out of line
.
.
I'm not saying midwives or doctors are unethical people who consciously repress women. I'm talking about a birth-culture and system underpinned by patriarchal values, that doesn't trust women and their bodies. The midwives and doctors we interface with are a product of this culture and the 'rules' of the system force them to comply with it in order to keep their jobs
.
.
I also know it's possible to traverse through this system and shape your care around your pregnancy, your individual wants and needs. This is what I'm passionate about helping women to do.

Hier war es eine Weile ruhig und es sind viele, viele Dinge passiert. Nicht nur im Garten (davon in den nächsten Tagen mehr), sondern auch privat: Ich habe meinen alten, sicheren, unbefristeten Job gekündigt und beginne in zwei Wochen einen neuen, unsere Kleine hat einen neuen Eingewöhnungs-Rekord in der Krippe aufgestellt und alles ruckelt sich gerade irgendwie zurecht.
Was ich aber vor allem erzählen möchte, mal fernab von Garten-Content: In meinem Vorstellungsgespräch vor ein paar Wochen - ich war super vorbereitet, das Gespräch lief toll und alles war geplant und durchdacht - wurde ich am Ende tatsächlich gefragt: „Die Stelle ist explizit als Vollzeitstelle ausgeschrieben - und Sie haben zwei kleine Kinder. Wie wollen Sie das machen?“ Das wäre der Moment gewesen, in dem ich hätte fragen sollen, ob sie das meine männlichen Mitbewerber mit Kindern auch gefragt hat. Habe ich leider nicht, frage ich mich aber seitdem. Und find‘s unglaublich.

🌟By apologising unnecessarily, women are undermining their own work. If you keep telling other people your work isn’t good, they’ll start to believe it!
🌟Try and hold yourself accountable: talk with other women about this and aim to spot how often you apologise and support each other in changing this behaviour #UnderstandDareThrive

Il y a un gros Mais. Comme je l’ai partagé en Story, le sexisme est encore très présent dans la culture « tattoo » et la convention n’a pas fait exception : représentations hyper sexualisées et standardisées des femmes, stands avec des véritables « femmes objets » avec qui se prendre en photo, produits de tatouages vendus avec des logos « sexy ».. 😩😤 Ouais, y a encore du chemin !! Et je me suis sentie à plusieurs reprises franchement mal à l’aise 🤷🏼‍♀️ Heureusement les choses changent aussi avec le nombre croissant de femmes artistes et d’artistes queer/lgbt+, même si pour le moment les hommes (cis) sont une majorité vraiment écrasante sur ce genre d’événements. Prenons donc possession des espaces de création,  et faisons entendre nos voix dans une industrie en plein mouvement mais qui a encore un long chemin à parcourir ! ✊🏻✊🏽✊🏿 Au final cet événement m’a encore une fois convaincue de la nécessité de lieux tels que @sibylles.shop pour faire bouger les choses, ensemble 💖✨

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This memoir is giving me so much food for thought. Alya Mooro eloquently describes the pressures experienced by Middle Eastern women, some of which are achingly familiar and others which are unique to her culture. (Disclaimer: it's published by my employer.)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I just finished a chapter about attitudes to sex. Mooro describes how her mother explained sex to her: don't do it before marriage or no one will love you. ""Where was any mention of my desires or my feelings in that conversation?"" she asks. Her question made me reflect on my own learning experiences - and how I relied on fiction to fill the knowledge void.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
At school, we had (laughingly incomplete) sex ed focused on periods and erections. The baseline was set: for women the focus was procreation, for men their urges.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Then my father took me aside and told me that society was unfair: boys could sleep around but girls couldn't. 11-year-old-me was too naive to question WHO those boys were sleeping with, or why gender inequality was an acceptable status quo.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Years later, when my mother finally sat me down to have ""the talk"", it lasted all of one awkward minute where she obliquely asked if I was being safe. (As always, the onus falls on women.)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
No one taught me about love, about consent, about desire. If it weren't for fiction, I would have had an entirely one dimensional view about sex as a currency between genders. Something that my value would be judged on by, as Mooro puts it, the invisible jury of society.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But while books helped plug the void, all-too-often fiction (and especially fantasy) has a warped representation of relationships. It's only now as an adult that I realise how damaging fiction can be in romanticising unacceptable behaviour - particularly in genres targeted at teens. I can't help but wonder how many girls are learning about sex and consent through books like I did... and how much YA authors should take responsibility for changing the narrative of what a healthy relationship looks like.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I hadn’t read it but had read a few things about it that caused me some concerns. So I started to instigate a discussion about healthy relationships. Her response was basically “it’s fun to read but no way would I even want to be in that sort of creepy relationship”. So I breathed a sigh of relief. A friend banned her daughter from reading them. She of course read them behind her mother’s back.|Most books have a really terrible relationship dynamic which is romanticized. The first one that comes to mind is 50 shades. But most feelgood I've read falls into similar traps.|The invisible jury of society, I'll remember that because it's so true. While I do think most fiction relationships are not realistic, they are better than how real life works. I don't think authors should take responsibility for this, as books are fiction and fantasies. The society and double standards are to blame. And both genders are responsible for perpetuating the myth of what normal sexual behavior is. But hey, after all the whole society is based on fictional rules that are imposed on us everyday 😂|I read Mills & Boon and Jackie Collins as a teen (who allowed that?!) thankfully I matured as a reader and quickly ditched all those stories that I deemed glossy/unrealistic. It’s so easy to fall into that trap of ‘control or excessive compromising = love’ 🙄🙄🙄
P.S loved your review/teaser. Can’t wait to get my own copy of The Greater Freedom 😊|I was actually having a rant about this the other day, how YA (but also fiction in general) has a lot to apologise for in terms of normalising unhealthy relationships. For YA in particular I think it's easy to overlook, because we're trained to expect certain things from certain genres; so when we're presented with a broody, damaged boy who behaves erratically toward his female partner, we roll our eyes and go, ""YA, right?"" and keep reading. Twilight's a great (and probably the most obvious) example. Edward's possessive, jealous, attempts to isolate Bella and quite literally stalks her - behaviour that's characteristic of abusers, but which is written off because that's just how broody YA vampire boys are. And after all, he only does it because he loves her, right? The follow-up implication that he (and other broody, dangerous male romantic interests) can be 'fixed' if their partner overlooks this behaviour is just the dodgy icing on an already damaging cake|💯💯💯Your post is 🔥 
I loathe hearing “It’s only in a book!” because teens really look to media for cues. The biggest influencer on teen behavior can be media, whether books, shows, or social media.|Thank you for the support and so glad to hear you are enjoying and resonating with #TheGreaterFreedom !! 💙💙💙|I feel most of the books has some or the other flaw which you can easily pick out but lately you can see a few of the books changing this thing but even then the number is very low. As you have correctly pointed out, this mostly happens with teen fiction so there is a lot of things one should look into when relying on what is written in the book. I love reading romance but there are things that are outright insane and you can't help cringing over it.|Bad - Edward & Bella in The Twilight Saga.|Lovely cover!!|Well, we all know my thoughts on this by now! 😂 I’m seriously considering putting sticky-notes in the copies of ACOTAR/ACOWAR/Twilight in my local library. If only I could succinctly describe my disgust 🤔 But I do think that YA SFF is specifically prone to this, and I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the plot itself must be much more action-oriented than a contemporary read. There’s also simply less page space that the writer can dedicate toward a nuanced relationship because of YA book length limits, and so they go for quick, high-drama instead ... and the easiest way of adding in that tension is to go the enemies-to-lovers/basically predatory or abusive route. It’s lazy and imo very damaging to young readers who escape into books and use them as the basis for their own fantasies.|What a great post!⁣
I think I've had a similar experience (maybe all women had). My parents were always very liberal and open, but I only learned it was okay to be a woman AND have wants and desires through reading. It did start with fiction, but even at a young age I could sense something in the way some relationships were portrayed bothered me, and it took me way too long to figure out what it was and why. ⁣
As for bad examples of fictional relationships - all of them? 😂⁣
Not really, but, honestly, the way romantic relationships are written in fiction is one of my biggest pet peeves. I think that's why I started writing romance, because I couldn't find one that was ""real"". And I agree with one of your previous replies - realistic relationships are NOT boring, perfect ones are (and they don't exist). I also agree with Ross about the power of fiction in the real world, not only for society as a whole, but for us as individuals. We really shouldn't settle for stories and authors that perpretate such toxic notions because it's ""just fiction"". It's not. Stories have power, words have power, we should all be more mindful of that.|Loving this post and the comments. 
I definitely learnt more about the mechanics of sex from Channel 4 than I ever did at school. My memories of sex education are limited to a video where two animated characters chased each other with feathers and putting a condom on a plastic penis. Discussions of what constitutes a ‘healthy relationship’ were limited to the topic of losing your virginity with nothing about emotional abuse, gaslighting etc. Admittedly, that was all a long time ago now and I’d hope things have improved.
I think you’ve touched upon one of the reasons that I really struggle with YA fantasy (not that adult fantasy is immune). The pure, ‘untainted’ female protagonist and the angsty, angry, destructive love interest in need of taming/saving/enduring is such a tired, problematic trope. It’s the main reason I much prefer MG, no angst ridden relationships... just super cute, fluffy friendships instead. 😂|The one that immediately springs to mind is Edward and Bella from Twilight.|Wow, I love this book cover!|Such a great post. I never had any conversations with my parents about relationships, whatsoever, so my 'education' was mainly limited to horror books and thrillers written by men 🙄.|Such an important topic!
I cannot really remember when I first learned about more than the biological aspects of sex, about consent and female desire. I suspect it was on the internet or maybe magazines 🤔.
As far as I remember the things we learned at school were purely biological as well. Interestingly, only the boys in my class learned how to use condoms and we didn’t really learn much about contraception at all 🤔.
I can’t remember ever having ‘the talk’ with my parents (maybe because I already learned the basics in 2nd grade at school) but by now I do discuss sex rather openly with my mum 😄. Actually, I don’t envy parents regarding this issue. When is the best time to teach your child about sex? When they become old enough to have sex? Or before puberty, before it becomes embarrassing to them, even if it doesn’t have any relevance for their life yet?
. 
I surely also read about sex in books from a young age on but I think this was rather unhelpful. Too often sex scenes were either problematic or so sugary and unrealistic (especially ‘first time scenes’ in YA novels 🙄) that they didn’t teach you anything useful. I find it shocking how many problematic relationships are portrayed as healthy and romantic in today’s YA and New Adult literature. I don’t know where this idea of the ‘bad boy’ who treats girls like sh*t and is still ‘the one’ came from but I find it disturbing.",142
199,199,"3/3 I felt that there was only me and a great sense of disgust filling my interior. It's hard to guess how many springs must pass and how many times women will have their dignity stolen in order for the world to understand that we are more than just bodies and roles that are imposed on us; that we also have minds and souls, ambitions and talents. That a woman is not only an empty beauty with which you can deal as you please, disgustingly staring at and eagerly reaching out with hands.

Bei einem Meeting sitzen wir alle beisammen, mir gegenüber ein neuer Kollege. Während jemand spricht, schaut mich dieser Kollege (etwa 30 Jahre älter als ich) so eindringlich an, dass ich es spüre. Als sich unsere Blicke treffen zwinkert er mir zu und grinst mich lasziv an. Ich werde sofort dermaßen wütend, weil ich mich kleingemacht fühle.

212,212,"2/3 After a few days of intense rainfall, the air cleared itself, covering the nearby hills in a dense fog. We drove along an asphalt road all the way to the valleys. Stalls with hats and corn stood on the roadside. All identical. I have seen no one stop by. It seemed that the salesmen were not looking for money there, but for killing time, which flows differently in Armenia, sluggishly, like a river deprived of the stream. Following the faces of the drivers filling the frames of my world for a fraction of a second, I realized that there was no woman among them. Since then, I have sharpened my eyesight and tried to capture every passing car looking for representatives of my sex behind the wheel. Unsuccessfully. I wonder where it comes from. Is it a question of upbringing, lack of resources, determination or interest? Or maybe it’s my oversight? I didn’t know who to ask. There were men on the streets. -

One of them stopped offering a ride to the store. I was not alone. We agreed. I sat in the back seat while Jasiek took the seat next to the driver. I remember his dark hair, his low height and his eyesight reflected in the mirror. He asked about my name and origin. He smiled and turned to me. We parked next to the supermarket. I thanked him for the ride, grabbed the handle and at the same time heard a voice coming from the front seat. - Close the door and don’t open it. -

I looked at Janek, but his eyes shone with a similar kind of disbelief. The driver insisted that I stay inside. Afterwards, he just kept repeating my name and obsessively wandering with his eyes over my body. Overflowed with anger, I let Janek know we were going out and pushed the door. The car followed us, but after a while, it disappeared into the chaos of the streets. I felt that there was only me and a great sense of disgust filling my interior. - // Our dearest @florrie_wallace ready for a trad climb!!! #ProjectArmenia

She realized that although she was carrying a heavy backpack and creating new routes on virgin walls in a women's team, in the eyes of many men on the way to the base camp she appeared only as a sexual object. Nothing better. She also knew that when farmers come back at night with a few bottles of vodka and their hands wander in the wrong directions, only the word spoken by the man could stop them. The woman’s voice was hitting the wall, becoming silence. .

Before I asked, I knew the answer. There is no equality in Armenia. According to a report by Amnesty International, every fourth girl born in a country of endless mountains will become a victim of physical violence, and her colleagues will be even more exposed to psychological violence. However, we cannot see these images. We cover them with walls of houses and a curtain of tradition that teaches that: - A woman is like wool; the harder you hit her, the more delicate she will be. Generations of women whose mothers and grandmothers, locked up in harem and raped on a mass scale, have somehow escaped death during the Armenian Genocide, seem to be largely accustomed to this patriarchal order. They have been broken in spirit for centuries. . // @kimstagraham.mcg & @florrie_wallace (belayer) during the first attempt on their fresh & super challenging route! #MADEBYGIRLS

214,214,"This October 4th will be the fourth year that red dresses have hung from the trees in Centennial Park in remembrance of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Trans and Two-Spirits. The REDdress Project which is now a nation-wide expression of grief, outrage and loss, was created in 2014 by Jaime Black, a Metis multi-disciplinary artist. As poignant as it is powerful, Black’s installation art project: red dresses and garments hung in wild and public spaces, has become a national action to evoke the memory and honour the humanity of our stolen sisters. 
The REDdress project is a simple but profound way to honour the humanity and the memory of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Trans and Two Spirits. 
This year take a moment on October 4th to witness these silent representations of lives lost to violence in the intersection of colonialism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and classism. People are invited to bring red dresses or garments to hang in Centennial Park between 8am and 9am on Friday October 4th, or to hang a dress in their driveways or work place. The dresses will be up all day. There will be a vigil at 4:30pm in Centennial Park to honour our stolen sisters.",everydaysexism,|#saltspring #saltspringisland #bc #britishcolumbia #evabc #metoo #gulfislands #genderedviolence #solidarity #timesup #believesurvivors #womensreality #everydaysexism k#heforshe #yesallwomen #endviolence #endsexualviolence y#endviolenceagainstwomen #right2housing|#missingandmurderedindigenouswomen #mmiwg #mmiwgt2s #reddressproject,57
215,215,"DARK cold NIGHT 
by #doveyilang .
You left me lying on cold hard street
Pavements biting at my skin
As darkness consumed me
And pain ate at my limbs
After using my secret place
Opening petals once know as heaven
Now i feel so ashamed
I wonder if i became a public place
You didn't care about my screams
Nothing i did made me human in your face
I was an object of pleasure 
Only for this dark scary lonely night 
Where i ceased to be human
I think you hoped i will die
But here i am trying to heal
From the demons of that one cold night.
And one day if we meet in the light
I will look you in the eye
And tell you i forgive you for that dark night
Because yes, i forgive you
I am not willing to carry you 
From that dark night into the rest of my life. .

Happy Myth Bust Monday!

A lot of people have the belief that many rape claims are false reports. The truth is, studies show that only 2-8% of rape claims are false reports. And that’s the same rate as any other felony!

220,220,"Mother’s Day cards, they found, were much more likely to have cursive lettering and pastel color palettes, especially featuring purple and pink, while Father’s Day cards used more “bold” colors, like blue, tan, black, and red, and often had “whimsical” fonts. Mother’s Day cards tended to feature flowers, leaves, butterflies, bees and dragonflies, and Father’s Day cards were decorated with tools, stars, cars, and men’s clothing (like ties). In terms of content, Father’s Day cards emphasized supporting the family economically, imparting practical lessons, and being the best—far more “Number One Dad” or “Best Dad Ever” sort of cards than mothers had. “It was like they needed an award, but there wasn’t a lot of depth in what they were achieving,” says Auster-Gussman, a doctoral candidate in social psychology at the University of Minnesota.

221,221,"""The debate persists because in the United States, the resistance to public child care has never been mainly about economics. It has been rooted in a moral argument — that the proper place for mothers (at least certain ones) is at home with their children.⁠
'In the United States, child care is still at the political level viewed symbolically and not economically,' said Leah Ruppanner, a sociologist at the University of Melbourne. 'All of the discussions are around the sanctity of motherhood, preserving the traditional family. Women and families are living very different lives from that.'""⁠

225,225,"So, I did a thing today. I stepped far out of my comfort zone and wore a pantsuit to church today.
.
.
Yeah, I know. To most Christians, it may not be a big deal. I mean, one of the local churches I visited here, the head pastor wore jeans with holes above the knees!! But, in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we try to wear our Sunday-best. Which, traditionally, means a dress or skirt for women. And sometimes, pantsuits are negatively associated for women to wear to my church.
.
.
But, I found this adorable pantsuit at Wal-Mart for $7!!! I couldn’t believe the price tag. And when I tried it on, I couldn’t believe how flattering it looked on me! I have always loved and adored pantsuits and rompers and jumpsuits. But, it’s so hard to find one that covers my garments and looks flattering on my XL mommy-pouch muffin top. So, I immediately bought it.
.
.
Then had the idea to wear it to church. It stayed with me for two weeks (last week, Rhys had a double ear infection so I stayed home). I wanted so badly to wear it to church as it’s more flattering than some skirts I have. But my anxiety and fear of being judged made me to nervous to commit. But after many talks with my husband who is more conservative than I am in all aspects, with my mom who I always go to for advice, and my sister who sometimes wears pantsuits to church herself, I got the same overwhelming response from all three:
.
.
“Just wear the darn pantsuit.”
.
.
So I did. I felt pretty. I felt worthy. And, no one said a thing. Plenty of people came up to me and commented my hair (thanks again to @dholdy for the milkmaid braid suggestion for my LOOOONG hair).
.
.
I can’t believe how good it felt. How liberating. How freeing. How empowering. How sexy—yes, I felt HOT. It was wonderful to still feel accepted without a blip or hesitation from my congregation. To feel just as close to my Savior. To feel comfortable, progressive, and still in my Sunday-best. I am so glad I listened and just wore the darn pantsuit.”",everydaysexism,|#thehappynow  #livethelittlethings #sobestfriendsforfrosting #photosinbetween #theeverydayproject #womenwithambition #bloomyellow #therisingtidesociety #leanin #imagirl #womenempowerment #fem2 #tothegirls #everydaysexism #morninglikethese #howyouglow #solovelysofree #momentsofmine #inbeautyandchaos #lds #femmorm #wearpantstochurch #churchculture #bethechange #overcominganxiety #lovingtheordinarymoments #documentyourdays #momcommunity|It looks great on you!|I’m obsessed with this pantsuit on you! 😍 Also if I was ever called to nursery I’d probably wear pants 😂 Otherwise I prefer skirts/dresses even not at church haha!,34

Can't we be smart individually,
Can't we all be strong individually,
Can't we all be proud individually,
Why do you have to say i am acting like a man,
Can't I be as aggressive as aggressive is,

Why is man the tape measure of intelligence,

by #doveyilang .

Was it the length of my dress,
Was it my short skirt,
Was it my body shape,
Was it my walk,
Was it my talk,
Was it my smile,
Or the look in my eyes,
That made you,
Push yourself onto me,
That made you,
Strip me of humanity,
That made you,
Use my secret haven,
That made you,
Break and robe me,
That made you,
Use me like a sex machine,
Is it me,
Or is it you?
Did I do anything wrong,
Or did I force you
To see a sex tool in me,
Is it my dressing,
Or is it your MIND?
.
.
I could have called this poem anything, but I wanted it to question what goes in the mind of an abuser. That it is not a victims fault but an abusers mentality.
There is this argument about women dressing provocatively. Is it me who is dressing provocatively or is it your mind that thinks it is provocative. Is it me or you who has a pornographic sexualized mind that anything that looks like the women in your phone is asking for sex.
God did not punish Bathsheba for bathing outside where ""David"" would see but ""David"" for looking, and looking the second time and going on to look and then desiring and then acting on his desires. 
When you say it's my fault that i am assaulted because of my dressing that also implies the man who assaltued me is an animal with low self control and should not be allowed to walk on the streets. That man is a monster an animal who will want to rape and destroy that which does not belong to him or that which in his mind is dressed provocatively. .

Women, small girls and boys, young men, anyone can be a victim of rape not because of how they dress. Women in medieval times were still raped i presume but they dressed to cover themselves. It is the mentality that the rapist has. That he has power and can use it.|@busoladakolo",73

Many years ago, when I joined the board of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award and attended a drinks reception at Buckingham Palace, I put out my hand to introduce myself to my new fellow board member (a white man of a certain age!) and he put his empty coffee cup in my hand and walked away.  He presumed I was the waiting staff. I just took the cup, with my mouth hanging open in total shock. I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t want to come across as some overly sensitive young woman and I didn’t want to make a scene.  So, I said nothing.  I really regret that now as my silence sounded like acceptance.
-
This is a perfect example of unconscious bias in action. He hadn’t even realised what he’d done, and he certainly hadn’t meant to cause offence. Speaking up is difficult. What if it becomes confrontational? What if I get emotional when I try to explain how their words or actions affected me? Will it make any difference?  We have to push past these concerns and speak up anyway because it is the only way to make the unconscious, conscious.  So, if you find yourself in a position where you are being treated unfairly or unequally, try one of the three strategies I explain in this video. -
I’ve also put together a free PDF to help you to walk through the steps of speaking up. You can get it at www.debrasearle.com/bias . I’d recommend printing it and stashing it in a notebook or your top drawer at work, just in case!  The good news is that the thought of speaking up is always much worse than the reality and, in my experience running the Diversity & Inclusion consultancy MIX, most people are shocked to find that they may have inadvertently hurt you or caused offence and are open to being re-educated. -

246,246,"""Ich bin Lehrerin und arbeite in einer Schule, die nahe an meinem Zuhause liegt. An einem Freitagabend gehe ich zur Straßenbahn, als ich einen Schüler mit seinem Vater treffe, wie sie gerade aus einem Lokal rauskommen. Ich bleibe stehen und begrüße die beiden, der Vater schaut mich von oben bis unten eindringlich an. Er fragt mich, ob er mir vielleicht was zu trinken kaufen dürfte. Mir und meinem Schüler ist die Situation sichtlich unangenehm, wir schauen uns an, ich schüttle den Kopf und bedanke mich. Beim Vorbeigehen nimmt er meine Hand und hält mich fest - sagt, er würde mir wiiiirklich gerne was zu trinken kaufen. Ich ziehe meine Hand weg, lache verlegen und gehe schnell zur Straßenbahn weiter. Im Nachhinein ärgert mich diese Situation besonders, weil er nicht nur mich, sondern auch seinen Sohn in eine unangenehme Situation gebracht hat.""⁠

268,268,"Title: Beat the Puss y Up.

Hyper aware of the derogatory language our culture accepts without blinking an eye, this piece is exploring gender bias and sexism in language. “Beat the Pussy Up” is a commonly used phrase in rap lyrics and people are singing it without considering the repercussions of their words. To me, the phrase is literally referring to raping a woman, but according to www.urbandictionary.com, the verb means to f*** the pussy and is “commonly used in street talk and hip-hop culture”. This language perpetuates the idea that women are sex objects for men to conquest. The reproductive organs also loosely resemble a bull skull as a symbol of women’s strength and resilience. The painting is an anatomical view of a woman’s genitals and I chose to accentuate the fabric’s qualities by tearing and fraying the edges, which also serve as a comparison to “Beating the Pussy Up”. .

Leider stand ich nach diesen Worten dermaßen unter Schock, dass ich mich nicht mehr erinnern kann, was ich darauf sagte (meine BH-Größe erfuhr er natürlich nicht). Woran ich mich jedoch sehr gut erinnern kann, ist, dass ich daraufhin ins Schulgebäude ging und so schnell wie möglich zum WC der Mädchen. Dort fing ich sofort an zu weinen, ich konnte mich kaum beruhigen.

280,280,"Les først ⏬Så sveip⏩Om sinne hos kvinner:  Etter Greta Thunbergs tale i FN denne uken ser vi det igjen. Hvordan kjønn, utseende og lidenskap får mer fokus enn innholdet i det som formidles. Fordi en jente skal jo ikke få ha sterke meninger eller inneha mer kunnskap enn en mann. Det finnes flere studier som viser at kvinners sinne ikke tolkes og oppfattes på samme måte som menns. Samtidig oppfattes kvinner som legger frem kritikk, eller for eksempel ikke tillater andre å avbryte henne, som sinte, og dette ses på som noe negativt og ufeminint når det er en kvinne, men beundringsverdig og godt når det er en mann. Kvinner som er sinte omtales ofte som hysteriske, altså ulogiske og ute av kontroll, mens blandt menn er det mer berettiget og i orden. Før 1950 var Hysteria en psykiatrisk diagnose satt på kvinner som menn syntes oppførte seg vrange og vanskelige (for eksempel som ikke adlød dem, eller gjorde motstand mot å bli dårlig behandlet). Ordet «hysteri» kommer fra det latinske navnet for livmor, og blir først og fremst brukt negativt om kvinner også i dag, særlig mot kvinner som kritiserer makten eller snakker om urettferdigheter. 
Det betyr at sinne og å vise følelser kan diskvalifisere dine meninger og fakta du presenterer hvis du er kvinne, og at du lettere kan oppfattes som og kritiseres som sint, selvom du bare uttrykker uenigheter, innspill, harde fakta eller konstruktiv kritikk. Det er sexisme og kvinneundertrykkelse. 
De siste bildene viser hvordan de mennene som prøver å tie og diskreditere henne overdriver hennes standpunkt og tillegger hun ekstreme meninger og oppførsel hun ikke har, for å fremstille hun i dårligere lys og sverte henne og hennes sak. Denne formen for trakassering og undertrykkelse ser vi også motstandere av feminisme gjøre.

It was said innocently but I find views like this concerning in the context of an industry that has a disproportionate number of male winemakers and business leaders. Subconscious bias is a big problem, so little things matter. 
Fortunately, we tasted a GIANT Sagrantino a little later, and when the instructor asked us to comment, I told the class: “I find it feminine. Powerful and bold.”

I knew by then that if Sophie had been fifteen instead of twelve, they would have taken a different approach. They would have had to.

Defence couldn't ask this little girl about what contraception she was on, then draw inferences to her promiscuity by reminding her that she also didn't have a boyfriend. They asked her what she was wearing to actually test her memory, not to suggest a shorter skirt had been selected to indicate willingness.

You can't make a difference."" The young boy picked up another starfish and lovingly tossed it into the deep water saying, ""I may not be able to save them all, but to that one I made a difference.""

We might be more likely to suppress emotions, to maintain cycles of abuse due to fear of ‘rocking the boat’ and allow things to escalate.

We all have coping mechanisms, and the things mentioned in the post are part of our way of feeling safe. Safety is crucial for our wellbeing. But we have to realise when we are helping and when we are hindering.

As a result of these things we often sacrifice our own feelings, needs and desires. This can build up into anger and resentment.

304,304,"❌ “Women aren't good at maths or science” ❌

From a young age, women are subtly discouraged from pursuing maths and science due to their reputation as ‘boys’ subjects’. While this year more girls took science A Levels than boys, there were still many more boys taking maths, physics and computer science.

Research shows there’s a negligible difference in mathematical aptitude, and that poorer performance can be directly caused by awareness of this insidious and ill-founded belief that girls are somehow innately not as good. This undermining of performance has been researched across many groups who are stereotyped as ‘not as good’ at certain things. For example, a white 100 metre sprinter will not run as fast competing in a race against black sprinters because of the impact of this stereotype threat. 
We need more women in STEM careers, so let’s break down the myth, take away the stereotype threat and encourage women to thrive in *all* fields.

JO DET ER DU❗🔺Dette er bilder fra @everydaysexismprojectdanmark sin Facebookpage (følg!), og oppsummerer holdninger vi desverre ikke ser for første gang! Kjente metoder menn bruker for å unngå å ta ansvar for egne holdninger; Bagatelliserer det, prøver å rette fokus på andre som gjør kriminelle ting eller at det kunne vært værre om noen andre fant henne, tror at det ikke er et problem og prøver å selv gå i offerrollen for å bli called out som det han er!  Mange gutter som tror de er blandt ""de snille"" er ikke det i det hele tatt!  Flertallet av voldtektene skjer av noen kvinnen kjenner og hadde tillitt til, oftest i sammenhenger som dette hvor en ""venn"" skal ""passe på"" hun og utnytter situasjonen til å forsyne seg! Både overgriperen og venner rundt han vil bortfeie det og ikke engang se alvoret i at det er en voldtekt. Norske undersøkelser fra NKVTS og Amnesty Norge viser at hele 17% norske gutter mener at det ikke er voldtekt selvom offeret har motsatt seg samleiet eller ikke vært i stand til å motsette seg samleiet og 28% mener at kvinnen er delvis med på det og ansvarlig om hun har flørtet i forkant og blitt med mannen🔺❗Grenser og holdninger må inn i seksualundervisningen, og vi i samfunnet må snakke om disse samfunnsproblemene som vi snakker om andre samfunnsproblemer.Om noen kaller deg rødstrømpe el. sier det mer om de enn deg og understreker nettopp hvor utbredt slike bagatelliserende holdninger er og det store behovet for å få folk til å reflektere mer over det og aktivt forebygge det med holdningsendring. Dette er fullstendig uakseptable og svært skadelige,kvinneundertrykkende holdninger, og det er derfor vi trenger feminisme!❗🚩#sykt #voldtekt #voldtægt #rapeculture #gutter #jenter #fest #alkohol #russ2020 #helg #uteliv #venner #samfunn #seksualitet #psykiskhelse #helse #livsstil #sykepleier #politi #regjeringen #sykt #metoo #seksualundervisning #everydaysexism #jodel #jodelnorge #nyheter #norge #danmark  #feminisme #feminist",everydaysexism,"|😱🤢|😱😱😱😱|🤯|🤐|Ett sånt svin! 😱|😱🤮|Jeg håper denne personen ikke er seriøs...

⁠
""When mothers do seek high-profile jobs, whether in government or in the private sector, they’re often asked how they balance work and family. As NBC 10 reporter Alison King put it in an April interview with presidential candidate Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), 'If you were a woman, the first question I would be asking you is, how are you going to juggle having an infant at home and a presidential campaign?'⁠
⁠
But asking only women that question perpetuates the idea that child care is women’s responsibility, something for them to figure out without the men in their lives. So Vox decided instead to ask all the male 2020 Democratic candidates with young children at home to describe their child care arrangements — who was caring for their kids, we asked, when they were off campaigning?""⁠

Too often I've seen people arguing that mothers should not be asked that question. But I think we should be asking everybody. Then we should be considering what the hell needs to change with the workplace so that family and leadership can be combined without all the care work being outsourced or crammed in at the margins of life.|I LOVE THIS|Yessss 💯|Was just wondering today when I looked at all the profiles on a childcare app, why all of them are women looking for childcare. Why? Why are women left with the responsibility of searching for, vetting, interviewing, paying and organising childcare as if they are finding a replacement for their “role”. Surely two parents  made the kid. So if two parents go back to work, then two parents need childcare, not one.",103

321,321,"The same techniques that make callback jokes so next level epic, can be considered of of my marketing magic secrets. 
They’re pretty great on a number of levels. 
Callback jokes are where you refer back to something previously done within a set. A skilled comedian will, over time, hone their set to make sure the joke called back is one of their highest performing. 
A lot of the time, the reference isn’t even particularly funny. But because it’s been emotionally anchored to a previous moment.. it’s funny by association. 
PS. I’ve studied comedy and if you’re a marketer who hasn’t, you’re literally behind the curve ball. 
So. Why am I telling you my secrets that appear to have nothing to do with marketing?

322,322,"Consent is sexy.⁠ 👉🏽 What Consent Involves:⁠
⁠
Consent means the agreement given to a sexual partner at the moment the partners take part in sexual activities.⁠
⁠
This consent must be voluntary. This means that it must be given freely and not forced. Consent must also be informed.  Informed means that the person consenting understands the consequences of the decision. If the choice is not free and informed, then the person's consent is not valid.⁠
⁠
There is no consent if someone refuses to participate in a sexual activity but is forced into it anyway.⁠
⁠
Also, the consent must be clear, and it must be given personally by the person taking part in the sexual activity. Consent based on the words or actions of someone else is not valid.⁠
⁠
👉🏽 How Consent Must Be Given⁠
⁠
The law doesn't say exactly how consent to sexual activities must be given. It is enough that someone consents through words, through actions or both these ways. Therefore, consent doesn't have to be verbal or in writing.⁠

⁣
▪️ Almost 30,000 people have signed a petition to change the definition of the word 'woman' in the Oxford Dictionary of English and its thesaurus companion.⁣
⁣
▪️ The two resources reflect everyday language use, but still state that ""bitch"", ""baggage"", ""frail"" and ""piece"" mean the same as ""woman"". Online examples of the definition of ""woman"" include ""I told you to be home when I get home, little woman"" and ""Ms September will embody the professional, intelligent yet sexy career woman.""⁣
⁣
▪️ One campaigner, @mbgiovanardi, set up a petition demanding that these offensive remarks be removed. She is asking for all discriminatory language to be altered and for minorities such as trans women to be represented.⁣
⁣
▪️ But the head of content strategy for the company told @guardian that terms won't be removed just because they are seen as derogatory. Instead, it will be made clear that they are offensive. Many women will agree that this isn't good enough.

The day started with a symposium on painful intercourse seen from various angles. Most of the speakers there are still of big influence to my work and it kind of felt like meeting my heroes. 🦸‍♀️ In the afternoon, Reinhilde presented her dissertation ‘’Vaginal penetration: Pain or pleasure? The role of fear and sexual arousal’’ and she did a great job! 
After the ceremony, I still had one goal before I returned home; introducing myself to one of the speakers of the morning program: Ellen Laan, who is doing an amazing research on female pleasure and whose work I admire a lot.

Ariel Baillie♀️
Creative Artist

I have been drawing since I was able to pick up a crayon. I have always loved arts and crafts and creating anything that came to mind. Growing up as a very nomadic child I was exposed to different parts of the world at a very young age which opened up my mind to a whole new perspective.

I didnt start focusing on acrylic paintings until I moved to vancouver in 2018. The response I received from my pieces opened up opportunities I never thought could become a reality. It sparked something within me and I have never looked back.

As each piece I created recieved such different interpretations it hit me to want to portray a message that could mean more to someone than just ""I like that"". This is where I met the beautiful mind of Aubree.
I had done a couple sketches of females that I posted on an Instagram story and she asked me if she could use them. This being my first time that anyone has asked to collaborate on a piece I was Instantly intrigued.
The piece she created blew me out of the water and I never thought I could see my sketches come to life the way she merged them together and put colour into it. I feel like this piece is where it all started for TPIF to come to light.
To empower each other to create and be represented in the art world never has meant so much to me then this moment right now. To see creative minds of women come together and make an impact is exactly what we want to do with TPIF.
The time is now to go for our dreams and create a reality with our goals.
“Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.” – Meghan Markle

TPIF is created to empower women to use their gifts of creativity and show the arts community that they deserve the spotlight. Once we allow women to understand and exercise their power, they can remake the world.

344,344,"I don't often talk about my work here, because I like to use this page to agonize and cry over my non-existent academic carrier and feel like my hate-love relation with my current job would be just too much for one instagram feed. But I had a very interesting conversation today, which cannot be really explained out of the context of my daily job.
.
So I work for a membership organization facilitating a networking platform and creating events for young founders. It's a hip, friendly, informal bunch with successful companies, big visions and huge ambitions. And obviously, it's a boys' club, more specifically a privileged white boys' club. While individually they are pretty cool people, as an organization this is really not the direction I want the group to grow further. So when I started and pointed out that we had less than 15% female members (let's not even talk about ethnic diversity...), they crowned me with the fantastic responsibility of solving this. Yeey, I am a woman, so I definitely can get more women on board! 🎉 Surprise, surprise, it's not that easy. We are still struggling, but minor achievement alert! we actually acknowledge the issue now openly! There have been (and will be) a lot of ups and downs in this journey, but one of the things which always breaks my wings is the feeling that the management only stands behind me and this project because ""it is the right thing to say"". Because diversity and inclusion is trendy, and they want to jump on the bandwagon. I feel everyday that when they say ""we need more female entrepreneurs"", they don't say: we need to include successful business women because that's good for us; that brings value, knowledge and different perspectives. They actually mean: we need to do this so we cannot be picked upon. We need this so our pictures on the website look diverse. Look that's a non-white female on our landing page!  And it makes me f&%$ing mad. 
I had a conversation with a consultant lady today and she offered me a completely different approach. She told me straight-up: ""Ok what if they only let you work on this, because they want to be hip and liked? Nothing. Grab the opportunity and make it happen.""
(⬇️⬇️⬇️)",everydaysexism,"|The first paragraph - I feel that so much 😢|(post continued) As women so often do, I also want the men in the organization to really GET IT. I want them to understand the importance of inclusion and get truly excited about including different groups into this boys' club. And that leads me to argue and counterargue and get emotional or angry on many meetings (and you know the thing they say about angry, emotional women in leadership positions...what is that word?🤔). But she surprised even my Ms. Cynical persona by saying: ""It's okay if they are doing this half-heartedly. Just go with it, let them be for now. Because ONLY by exposure will they learn empathy and understanding."" I know it's a sad reality, but in my case, this is the reality. I know my reasons, and although they might focus on the wrong reasons, in the end I still have an opportunity to get them to where we should go. And hopefully, they will truly understand why equality and inclusion are beneficial, even if now, it's just a marketing stunt for them...So today was a good day.|#bibliophile #ragebecomesher #rebeccasolnit #menexplainthingstome #feministreads #feminism #proudfeminist #BadFeminist #everydaysexism #workplacesexism #readerslife #readersofig #booklover #readnonfiction #womenwhoread #womenempowerment #womenwriters #nonfictionreads #nonfictionbooks #bookishlife #readeveryday #readingaddict #readingwomen #bookishconfession|I applaud what you’re doing!!

You stand on the shoulders of strong women who had to fight tooth & nail for where we are now. And the fight is still far from over!! I & many other women are with you in spirit sis!!! 👏🏽💓📚|I love your post. Keep rocking. (And whoa nellie do I try to keep work grumbles away from my bookstagram, but it is TOUGH.) Your post was constructive and thoughtful.|I constantly express my anger over sexism, misogyny and patriarchy in my conservative society. I try to talk some sense into these brainwashed people and get them to see what’s wrong with men having all the power, with being submissive to society’s diktats and so on and so forth. I don’t care if I am labeled as an angry woman, I am sure my ideas will creep into their heads. Change takes time and patience. Even token diversity and inclusion is welcome as a first step to the real deal. Kudos to you for fighting for change 👍|Congrats, it's awesome that you made that progress even if it's far from the end goal 😅 I hate when businesses add diversity with the motivation being that it's the right thing and such be it usually means the company culture isn't going to change. They add women or poc and when they notice they don't perform as well as their white, male colleagues they're confused. They don't take systemic sexism or racism in account and the need for structural change. Good luck with your task and I hope you keep us up to date 😊|It's great if you can keep a strategic mindset, but definitely take care of yourself while working on changing the company one tiny step at a time ;) I was in a similar position a couple of years ago but the CEO of the company wasn't supportive of the move (beyond some shallow, branding initiative) and it was sometimes really hard for me to keep my cool, as you have expressed yourself. I hope you'll succeed - small progress is still progress, so use their weaknesses to your advantage ;) 🙏🙏🙏|@adolphathegreat - Kinda interesting. The 'window dressing' motive for creating more diversity is alive and well in even younger seemingly more socially progressive groups...|Love this. 💛|That's amazing that you're doing this at least even if it's just a ploy for them. You can get shit DONE! 💜💜💜|👏 I think that's a good point! But I understand your frustration and have been there myself, more than once. I felt disappointed in people's lack of effort and it hurts because it's connected to core values for me. But they can get on the train or get left behind, because I'm leaving the station of ""explaining and engaging with people who don't really care"". 👋|Well done you for putting up with this sh*t 👏🏻 I think it is thoroughly disturbing that it is clearly being done as a tick box exercise. I mean what it is really showing all the young white men who work at your organisation. That basically it’s ok to just do it because it’s what you do, without the why and most definitely about the why it’s important and why it should be the norm. It worries me that in 2019 this is still happening as I keep hoping we are more inclusive and have moved on from this. Sadly I think this shows we haven’t. I truly take my hat off to you as I would be hopping mad 💚|I love that you are working on changing things in your company! And I absolutely get why it makes you angry that they only want to do it because diversity and equality are currently ‘trendy’. I feel like the other problem with this attitude is that even when people work on diversity because they believe in it, they get comments like ‘They’re only doing this because they want to look cool and diverse’ which is very insulting. It implies that some people were only hired because of their race/gender/... and not because of their qualifications which is kinda racist/sexist/...
But I guess the woman you were talking to is right too that any change, however motivated, is better than no change at all in this case. And hopefully she will be right and after some time the people in your company will recognise all of the advantages of diversity.|One needs courage for doing what you are doing, Bori and I am so proud of you.

347,347,"Continuing this week's #JointheBookCult prompt for books that made me cry... Here's a (crap) photo from my archives of an amazing book you must read!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I finished EVERYDAY SEXISM a few days ago. One of the chapters reminded me of THE KNIFE OF NEVER LETTING GO, because it discusses the silencing of women. Todd grows up in an all-male world where everyone hears each other's thoughts. The dearth of women in all this ""noise"" is pivotal to the story.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In real life, our silencing is much more subtle. I was speaking to another woman recently who - with an exasperated shake of her head - said her husband jokingly calls her a raging feminist. And I wondered: why is it funny? Acting like feminism is a joke is a form of silencing so ingrained that even well-meaning men subscribe to it. I've hit the same wall when I challenge sexism: an unrepentant ""it was just a joke"". I'm silenced by the implication that I'm a humourless sourpuss. (Turns out I'm a raging #feminist too. Haha, the joke's on me. 🙄)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The worst form of silencing is taking away my victimhood. It's men telling me I'm overreacting or being offended when I spurn them. It's being told to think of the repercussions if I publicly complain about a man - how might it reflect on that guy, on myself, our acquaintances, our employers? Will I get into trouble?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The notion that women bring sexism upon themselves like lightning rods of calamity, that we are both victim and perpetrator, has shaped my existence. It informs what I wear, how I become quiet when a strange man makes me uncomfortable, and why I sometimes hesitate to challenge sexism, because when has speaking up ever gotten me anything?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
""There's her silence,"" Todd thinks, ""loud as a roar, pulling at me like the greatest sadness ever, like I want to take it and press myself into it and just disappear forever down into nothing.""

I had a colleague talk about touching my boobs in front of almost the whole (male dominated) company and no one raised an eyebrow. Just a sense of ‘oh we don’t go in for political correctness here’ and ‘you know what he’s like. He doesn’t mean anything by it.’ When I saw him a year or so after I left, the first thing he said to me was “Still a feminist?” I replied with “Yup. Still an asshole?”|Not a crap photo! Thank you for writing this. ❤️|I already own the third book in this trilogy. Can't find copies of the first two books. 😂 But I love Release and The Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness so I'll definitely read this trilogy. 😁|Not at all a crap photo!

And when you confront them, it's the same response 'it was a joke'.(and I cringe inside)|I’m always getting into arguments about my feminism I just shout even louder honestly it’s sad that telling someone off on what they say makes it seem as though your a rampant and crazy feminist when all you want to do is get heard|I have read only one book by this author and that was A Monster's Call|Wow!  Such an inspiring, empowering post!|I really love this post, Anna. 🖤|I had taken a photo for this week’s prompt but when I got home realised it was blurry and I have no beer in the house to retake it 😭 just a little behind the bookstagram for you 😂 Anyway - this book sounds like a must read!!|There is a random thing here that a fair number of people do that I really don’t like: the kiss on the cheek as greeting. I guess it’s because I never grew up with it, but to me it sometimes feels like an excuse for a guy acquaintance to get a bit handsy and I just. Loathe it. Guys don’t do that with other guys! Don’t do it with me! *end rant*|What a sharp and beautiful caption! ❤️ It makes me want to reread this series; I read them when I was 14 - I wonder how I will look at the books now.|So many important things that you mention here!
I hate the ‘It was just a joke’ excuse. Firstly, it probably wasn’t ‘just a joke’ because that person could’ve made a non-sexist joke instead but deliberately chose to make it a sexist one, secondly, by making jokes you still normalise sexism and thirdly it’s the offended party who gets to decide what’s offensive, not the offenders. It’s like white people making jokes about black people and then saying it was ‘just a joke’. Just because a joke that is not about you is not offensive to you, doesn’t mean it can’t offend anyone else. And instead of thinking at least one second about why this joke might’ve offended someone, people just brush you off with this ‘It was just a joke’ comment to tell you your opinion isn’t valid and they don’t care about it.|Oh wow, what a thoughtful post and powerful quote! I have also never liked the ""it's only a joke/you can't take a joke"" thing. And the implication of course that you are completely humorless/stuck up/prudish. That and the ""everyone does it"" excuse. Also, work is supposed to be professional - would people please act like it? It would make life so much easier for everyone!|🙌🙌🙌|Great (and sad) caption! I relate so much with the ""you're no fun"" thing. I've been excluded of so many circles, including at work, because people (men, mostly) couldn't ""joke"" with me. And your last paragraph just sums up the whole experience of being a woman (again, sadly).|Brilliant brilliant post. Will add this to my tbr, it sounds fascinating (and horrendously sad/terrifying).
I left my last job due to a mean, sexist bully that masqueraded as a Nice Guy. He went out of his way to belittle, intimidate and humiliate me. He made the male-dominated office (was finance) even more boys club - not letting any women out for drinks after work with them. He cornered one woman at the Xmas do and asked ‘shall we go have sex now’. He hugged me against my wishes and often made weird comments about my appearance. Yet when I reported this to HR (and filed a grievance), it came down to his word against mine, and maybe I was just too sensitive. He was utterly vile and I’ve spent the last six weeks having the worst anxiety attacks and rebuilding my self-confidence. But yknow boys will be boys and he was obviously just bantering!!!!! Makes me so mad. So mad.|What a great review. Patrick Ness is one of the few authors who can really hook into my emotions.|I've had this on my shelf for a while but having read this review I will definitely try to get to it in October!|Yes yes yes. I have somehow missed this. What an amazing review. I too am tired of being a feminist and being made to feel shitty for having the temerity to speak out.  I too am tired of being made to feel insignificant, of being given shitty assignments at work because apparently I won’t need to think too much about those and could do them from home (I don’t work from home...). I have recently read Emilie Pine’s Notes to Self and her last essay spoke about her thoughts on feminism, the silencing of women in the work place and how it’s not ok for us, women, to just stay quiet but at the same time how tiring it is to continuously be fighting the same fight.|Great post!!

⁣
In light of the recent documentary on BBC that revolved around the story of @jesynelson from @littlemix being cyber-bullied to the point of a suicide attempt, I thought it was appropriate to highlight my post 'Why You Don't Get To Comment On Her Body' (LINK IN BIO).⁣
⁣
After watching the documentary myself, I didn't feel angry like I thought I would, I felt sad and disappointed. Jesy is a beautiful young woman with a smile that radiates pure sunshine, why anyone felt the need to shame her, I don't know.⁣
⁣
I'm fed up of seeing fat-shaming, skinny-shaming, slut-shaming and all other forms of shaming become a normal part of everyday life when online. I have had to start taking time off social media because it has impacted on my mental health in a detrimental way. Unfortunately, my blog and writing/editing career both rely on social media so I do have to be present.⁣
⁣
What does anyone have to gain by spreading hate? Just be a bit kinder it isn't that hard or better yet keep it shut and don't comment at all.⁣

373,373,"""Zum 50. Geburtstag feiert meine Mutter ein großes Fest. Viele ihrer Freunde und Freundinnen kenne ich schon seit ich ein Baby bin, ich freue mich auf die Feier. Nach ein paar Stunden lassen etliche Freunde Kommentare fallen wie: „Ah, die Feministin, eh klar!“ „Vor dir darf man ja garnichts mehr sagen!“, wenn ich zu einem Gespräch dazukommen. Ich sage nichts dazu, möchte bei der Feier keine unangenehmen Situationen zulassen und daher keine heiklen Themen provozieren. Später bin ich dann mit einem guten, alten Freund meiner Eltern und meiner Mutter alleine bei der Bar. Er legt seine Hand um meine Hüfte - aus dem Nichts heraus, ich sage kein Wort - und sagt: „Naja, du hast den Mund ja nie halten können, Frau Ober-Emanze!“. Ich drehe mich von ihm weg und sage: „Entweder du hörst jetzt auf oder dieser Abend wird ganz einfach schlecht enden.“ Er lacht und dreht sich zur Bar, die Konversation ist beendet.""⁠

The bottom line is that Kavanaugh now faces (AT LEAST) THREE separate sexual misconduct allegations. ⁣

Each of them is corroborated to some extent, but during his confirmation hearing Kavanaugh issued BLANKET denials. ⁣

And in addition to detailing the new allegation, the Times reporters who spent months digging into the Kavanaugh allegations also note they found two previous allegations made against him to be credible.” - Aaron Rupar, Associate Editor @voxdotcom ⁣

377,377,"I won't stop talking about equality until the micro aggressions in our daily lives stop taking place. It's rampant, seeped into our language, daily chores, habits and behavior. It is nearly impossible to not be sexist. We are all, by default, sexist. 
I have come across men and women taking pride in ""giving/getting freedom"". Because women and free will, don't go hand in hand. But you can't give anyone freedom! That's patronising and frankly, demeaning. ""Girls in our family get married by a certain age. We ""let them"" wear, talk or pursue education so you can't call us orthodox!""
.

News Flash: You are worse than the obvious sexist ones. You are stuck in a stale set up. You refuse to unlearn the old ways only because you lack the ability to question tradition and culture. You're logical at your convenience and time. You are the reason these micro aggressions pile up and turn into something malignant called, gender inequality and deny women and other minorities their rights. You are part of the problem. We are part of this problem. .

378,378,"Beautiful little boat spotted on the Thames. I was running past it towards Blackfriars and I spotted it. It wasn’t a great run. I was catcalled twice by groups of men. Unfortunately not an isolated experience. First time was I wolf whistled at which was unpleasant and made me feel quite self conscious - but I kept on going. Second time it was slow claps and direct eye contact, right in my face as I jogged past (I was jogging slowly because I was stuck behind a group of tourists). That time I felt really threatened. The slow claps felt quite sarcastic. The eye contact felt threatening. It rather took my energy away and I didn’t complete the whole distance I wanted to because of it. Easy to say - ignore it. Hard to do and I don’t think I should. But hey - I went out for a run anyway and I kept on going. I could probably out run those men that’s for sure.

They I tell them they're so smart, or that they must be so strong if they do sports and other stuff. I try to compliment their skills.|You’re so well behaved; you’re so kind; you’re going to be a strong girl; you sure know how to be gentle; etc.|Talking about their favourite toys|So I realized this and constantly try to compliment them on their intelligence or attitude and talk to them about school or what they're upto and think of things instead of generic compliments|I love this! Also, fixed mindset vs growth mindset theory encourages us to compliment the efforts amd actions instead of placing labels on the child themselves. Like, when first meeting a kid at a gathering, asking questions like about what activities they like to do, and then connecting with the kid over the merits of those activities.|@gayatrir.93|Oh..that's so smart! How did you get so smart so young? Watch out for her everyone!|I’ve been told by a family member (a woman) at age 11-12 that my boobs were too big for a young girl my age and I should get them operated, So why limit socializations around appearances to just little girls. I had the sense to use fair judgement and realised that she was a total nut job. It also helped because my parents told me to ignore loose talk, both of whom who set very strong examples of what mattered most to them - their work and what they make out of their lives. The type of examples they set for me, helped filter out a lot of the other voices. I suppose it didn’t matter what other people thought. My comment is not to bring anyone’s experiences down but to engage in a dialogue about how we need to conduct ourselves as 20-30 year old somethings to bring up the next generation of girls!|I am however not saying that you ever come out full proof and well guarded against comments like that when you are a young person. Having an example in front only helps in better managing your feelings about such comments when they’re thrown at you, completely out of the blue. The reason why I’m sharing this today is because I realised how stupid people can be and decided to find my own path, never say another word about a persons appearance no matter what age, color, or gender *end of rant*|Compliments about their school work and hobbies.|@tunes_retuned do read this! ❤️|""Oh wow! You're so smart/intelligent""|Words like smart, intelligent, good leader, responsible, determined, strong,|you like the yellow flowers on your dress ? i love them 😍|You pick up early, you're smart/strong/brave/loving|Smart. Important. Playful. Loving. Cared for. Courageous. Curious. Helpful. Creative. There are so many!  We ❤️ this post!|I once complimented my niece for being kind and generous. I somehow never thought I should have  complimented my nephews on kindness and generosity. Sometimes even compliments on attitudes can be gendered, I guess. I think just being really mindful around children helps and most apologising or correcting ourselves when we have engaged in gendered behaviour.|Simple rule of thumb when you're addressing children, people... Keep it genderless. Your comments or questions or any form of conversation with your kindergarteners should not be based on their gender. Talk to a child that is assigned female at birth like you would to a child that's assigned male at birth. (That's right. Your child should choose it's gender or even the lack of a gender, at an appropriate time decided by it. You really don't have any right to impose gendered norms on your child).|E.G. 1 I see you can standup and walk on your own. 2. You have silky brown hair. 3. Your smile makes me smile.|I use words like smart, clever and strong to compliment children. Have taught my 5 yo daughter to focus on skills instead of appearance|Bruh they didnt even comment on her weight they said she looked cute and they liked her dress. It'd be really fuckin weird to compliment someone you don't know on something other than their appearance|You look so happy 😅|@weunlearn this is a great post, as great as every other posts of yours. Came across your page through @indian.radical.feminists story. But I would like to point out with respect to this post that, children will begin questioning their body, when they hear their parents speaking about not eating a certain food, going into diets because they are fat. Remember the kids at age 3-6 clearly don't understand the term fat completely, they may even term a kid who has inhaled air and kept his lungs full to show a bloated stomach as fat. You guys haven't pointed out that as parents, what we speak, what we act as for a topic, will be learnt by kids. Calling a girl pretty/cute or a boy handsome/cute doesn't make them think about their body. Yes it is necessary to make sure kids don't get worried about their body and consider calling themselves fat.",486

Of course, if you tell your other half that ’I’m really not coping well with all this and I really need your help’ and he shows no care or interest, there might not be much left in the way of love and caring for each other? And if so, MAYBE a divorce could be a happier solution for all involved including the child. 
But to tell a new (or even not so new) mum that she should get rid of her husband because he’s acting the same as he was before they had children seems harsh. I don’t like the tone either, with the ’if you don’t step up you can get out and I’ll get myself another man’ talk. 
Sometimes life feels totally shit and worthless, and you might even think of ending it because you can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel. But you stick around and it gets better and tou have wonderful days when you are SO grateful you didn’t end it. Marriage is like that too.|Yep. When people tell me ‘You’re so lucky to have Dylan. He does so much’, my usual response is ‘Does he want a medal or a chest to pin it on?’ 🤔🤔🤔|Love this 🙌👏|This is so perfect. I work 30 hours a week at my job, plus mother my almost 5 year old. My husband works 40 hours a week and somehow, I think it is ok, not only ok but warranted, that he get to sleep in on the weekends (even though in work at night and get up at 6am with our daughter) that he get to have as much free time as he needs, and that I don't place any undue burden on him by asking him to do equal to me. I feel like it is my duty to pick up the slack. I know this is bullshit. It is so frustrating, but I don't know how to change it.|A MILLION TIMES YESSSSSSS who the fuck wants a man child for a husband?

Fab night with my mama catching the Downton Abbey movie event, drinks and canapés galore and the Everyman cinema even left wee gifts on our seat ❤️. So many laugh out loud moments and tears. 
I was thinking, why do I freaking gleefully love Downton Abbey when it stands for everything I'm against? 
Too much patriarchy 
The monarchy 
Living a life of obligation 
Sexism

Crazy harmful aristocratic parenting methods 
Pointless etiquette 
The pomp and ceremony 
The list goes on. 
And I realised it's because of the women. 
The strong women. 
The women who are brave enough to live their truth and speak their minds against that backdrop. 
Because of the love stories of people finding some happiness against all the odds in that society and time. 
Because of the moments where people break through the injustice. 
But most of all, because Maggie Smith's quick wit is the gift that keeps on giving 😉 .

396,396,"Let’s talk about objectification.
.
I added some of the photos from this set to my modeling portfolio. I got a message from a random older man I have never met or interacted with, who started off by recommending I create a portfolio of more “tempting” photos, and went on to say “your poses look awkward, and don’t show off your figure”. As he went on to talk to himself in my inbox, it became increasingly clear he didn’t like my style because it wasn’t sexually appealing to him. He didn’t like the suit because it didn’t “accentuate my assets”. And I’m sure he hated seeing a young women not looking 100% feminine.
.
Let me be clear, I am not a product to be consumed. I refuse to be objectified. I am a person with feelings and goals and desires, and I deserve respect.
.
Almost daily I receive explicit messages and comments. Things like “I want you”, “show me your body”, or even “f$!k me”. THIS IS NOT OKAY. And as a woman in this field, it can feel like you have to just take it in order to get work.
.
If you know or care about a woman in a creative field, send her some love today, and if you see someone acting inappropriately, call them out.

Wir kamen dort an und ziemlich schnell traf mein Vater auf alte Kollegen. Ein älterer Herr kam auf uns zu und begrüßte ihn. Mein Vater schüttelte seine Hand und stellte mich als seine Tochter vor. Der Herr sah mich an und während er noch die Hand meines Vaters schüttelte wandte er den Blick wieder zu ihm und sagte ""Glückwunsch!"".⁠

431,431,"“I started @wearethensfw because there is so much that is available to men that is just not available to women at all. A lot of female sexuality is demonized and repressed and I felt that was unfair. And I myself being bisexual, I would like to be in an environment where I can find both. I want to know if I make out with a guy, it's not going to make everyone uncomfortable. All the guys are not going to lose their boners. So part of it was a little bit selfish.
-
At the same time, I was in fashion and beauty, working with Louis Vuitton, Burberry, and all these brands. I felt like I was wasting my life to convince women to buy things they didn't need to make them feel happy for a temporary period. I decided I’d rather spend my life helping people find true happiness through fulfilling sex lives.
-
And weed became part of NSFW because I think sex and cannabis are two of the greatest gifts that God has given us. They both have been demonized by people - religious leaders mostly - as a way to control people and use that as a way to shame people. And that way, they can get more money. That is the reason why religions are billion dollar industries.
-
I grew up as a Jehovah’s Witness. I consider myself a true Christian. What Jesus taught was focused on your love of others as you love yourself, but so many people hate themselves because they have been shamed and feel like everything they're doing is wrong. They feel like every thought they have is an inclination towards evil and they're constantly stressed about very normal thinking.
-
I wanted NSFW to be a place people are proud to say they go. Five years ago, no one would've posted to their Instagram, ‘I'm getting ready to go to the sex club.’ Now people do. Women especially love that they can walk around naked and no one is going to do anything to them. It is a safe, judgment-free space and people want to share that. We have a lot of members who bring people. One person said, ‘I brought my cousin. I hope that's okay.’ And I’m like, I don’t know your family dynamic but sure. I even had one person tell me they wanted to bring their mom because she would love it and I was like, okay maybe not.”",everydaysexism,"|omg, i just laughed so hard at the last paragraph.|#lgbtquotes #wellnessquotes #christianquotes #growingupchristian #jehovahswitnesses #bisexualpride #bisexualdating #bisexuality #feminismisforeverybody #feminismisforeveryone #fucksexism #everydaysexism #pride🌈 #weedhumor #marijuanaisnature #godquotes #livefree #nojudgment #shamefree #wellnessjourney #wellnessthatworks #wellnessadvocate|yay, thank you|🙌|😍👏🙊🤣😍👏👏👏",130

436,436,"Sono appena tornata da una settimana in Italia. L'ho passata principalmente al Festival Letteratura di Mantova e in sconosciute località emiliane dove l'unico scopo del mio passaggio era cambiare treno.
🚉
A parte le tante bellezze viste, le persone incontrate, i discorsi meravigliosi e letture di cui probabilmente parlerò ancora, c'è una cosa che mi è venuta spontanea condividere ieri, un aspetto dell'essere donna in Italia a cui non sono più tanto abituata: gli sguardi insistenti che mi scansionano dalla testa ai piedi.
Sentirmi un pezzo di carne da valutare e soppesare quando entro in un bar, in un vagone del treno, cammino per strada accaldata e scollata. 🐾
Succede anche a Barcellona, come no, succede ancora dappettutto a tutte; ma mi sento di affermare che, quando capita, il contesto qui è molto specifico e circoscritto. 
Mi rendo conto che invece in Italia, da nord a sud, la vivo come una specie di pegno da pagare, un ""funziona ancora così"". Sono sguardi innocui, la maggior parte delle volte, ma pesano tanto, comunque. Macchiano in qualche modo la spensieratezza con cui mi piace girare per strada; non voglio essere una cosa da guardare quando cammino per i fatti miei.
🐾
Ieri ne ho parlato a lungo nelle stories e ne è venuta fuori una conversazione interessante, e tanta condivisione (le salverò nella categoria ""Machismi"").
🐾
Come ciliegina marcia sulla torta, il #totalfail del personale @ryanair
sul mio volo di ritorno (descritto nelle storie ""Machismi""), durante il quale lo steward ci ha invitati a desiderare due COSE: la sua collega Paola e il catalogo profumi che aveva in mano. Amara realizzazione che i comportamenti sessisti sono ancora MOLTO presenti anche in contesti professionali e di servizio all'utenza.
🐾
(In foto, io che cammino in una Mantova piovosa, con zaino sulle spalle e poncho che mi copre da capo a piedi. Non passavo inosservata nemmeno così, e stavolta per ovvie ragioni, visto che il poncho viola a pois è bellissimo ma tutto tranne che anonimo 🙈). .

438,438,"""Einige Zeit habe ich als Empfangsdame in einem bekannten Restaurant gearbeitet, wo der Großteil Kellner sind und somit Männerüberschuss herrscht. Da man als einzige Frau und dann auch noch in Rock und Bluse dort arbeitet, ist es generell schwierig sich zu beweisen und ernstgenommen zu werden. Meistens wird man als dumme, sexy Restaurant Püppchen angesehen, die nur dekorativ da ist. Mit Schlagfertigkeit und Selbstbewusstsein, kann man dennoch darüber stehen. ⁠
Eine Situation hat mir dann aber wieder gezeigt, wie man wirklich gesehen wird und von da an, bin ich wirklich nur mehr für das Geld, solange wie nötig zum Arbeiten gekommen und hatte keine Freude mehr daran. ⁠
Als Empfangsdamen waren wir auch dafür verantwortlich zu Sanitäranlagen zu kontrollieren, ob beispielsweise Papier nachzufüllen wäre. Einer der arroganten Kellner kam zu später Stunde, wo nur mehr wenig los war, auch dazu und meinte aus dem Nichts, ob wir jetzt Sex hätten. Ich dachte zunächst es wäre ein Witz, den ich einfach nur unangebracht und unlustig fand. Aber er meinte es tatsächlich ernst und führte seine Frage fort mit: „Warum nicht? Du bist doch eh single?!“ Nach meiner schockierten Abfuhr wollte ich nur mehr aus der Situation und vor allem aus dem geschlossenen Raum, da ich langsam etwas Angst bekam.⁠
Seit meiner „Abfuhr“ hat er mich nur mehr vor allen beleidigt und abwertend behandelt.""⁠

It's not ""you're either with us or against us"". Some people have a non-traditional divide between their values. As a result, they choose neutrality rather than vote against their own self-interest. Forcing someone to go against their own self-interest is just as bad as not allowing them a choice, which is why not voting is a valuable right and a choice I respect.|YES. Saying ""I'm not political"" is defending the status quo.|thankyou|I think voting 3rd Party is much more effective because it doesn’t just show protest but also the intent of your protest.

452,452,"Auszug aus meiner Masterarbeit (Müller 2019:15) zum Thema Sexismus: •
Es lässt sich feststellen, dass Macht und Überlegenheit des einen sozial konstruierten Geschlechts immer in gewisser Weise auf die Minderwertigkeit des anderen angewiesen sind. So hatten Männer früher schon das Recht, anhand von Literatur, die sie über das andere Geschlecht verfasst hatten – also diskursiv – „Frauen zu definieren und zu interpretieren, aber nicht umgekehrt“ (Assmann 2012:22). Diese Vormachtstellung von Männern in der Gesellschaft kommt auch anhand der Theorie des sogenannten „ambivalenten Sexismus“ zum Ausdruck. Sie beruht auf zwei unterschiedlichen Arten von Sexismus, die gleichzeitig und nebeneinander existieren. Während die eine Art – der „hostile sexism – HS“ als feindseliger Sexismus von Männern gegenüber Frauen zum Tragen kommt, ist die andere – der „benevolent sexism – BS“ noch tückischer, denn sie äußert sich in eigentlich positiven Einstellungen und sozialem Verhalten Frauen gegenüber. Tückisch deshalb, weil diese positive Haltung nur jenen weiblichen Mitmenschen gegenüber gilt, „die sich entsprechend ihrer genau umgrenzten, stereotypen Geschlechterrolle verhalten. [...] Ungeachtet der positiven Gefühle, die wohlwollende Sexisten Frauen entgegenbringen, bleibt BS auf der ideologischen Ebene insbesondere deshalb problematisch, weil nach wie vor von Frauen erwartet wird, ihre „häuslichen Pflichten“ zu erfüllen und sich als das schwächere Geschlecht zu gerieren.“ (Fiske/Norris 2012:74)

475,475,"‘It’s about bloody time’ @emmabarnett new book is about PERIODS - at last more discussion about women’s health! And it’s thanks to women like Emma, that I recently felt very comfortable to show my 11 year old boy a tampon and a sanitary towel and explained in depth how each is used. He was relaxed and happy to discuss as if it were a normal everyday habit. Which it is, and I hope his future girlfriend/wife will have his full commitment and empathy during their period. I also did this because at his school the boys were not shown the products in real life when they had a discussion about their bodies and sex education. 🤔
I’ve been on a period for 11 weeks since having the mirena coil fitted in June, and I’m exhausted! I’m persevering because eventually the periods will stop 🛑 I’m menopausal and on HRT which was resulting in continued very heavy flowing periods, which are debilitating, hence having the coil fitted. I’d not bargained for 11 weeks and counting tho! I’m currently writing a blog about my 8 year menopause journey! In the mean time I will be buying a copy of Emma’s book and be sharing it with my 11 year old boy.

Normally I’d walk away but I felt so upset and they weren’t moving, so I stuck my middle finger at them in frustration. Immediately they burst into laughter - this horrible devious laughter. We were on a street with a lot of traffic so they kept slowing down or speeding up to get next to me and verbally harrass me. I turned onto the nearest street the first chance I had just to avoid these men. I am so upset that I can’t walk to work without feeling dirty and violated. #submissions #fuckthemalegaze #everydaysexism #thecatcallcollective",everydaysexism,"|This is when you take out your phone and start recording. 🔴|While walking home today, a man probably in this mid 60s drove by and stuck his tongue out at me.

484,484,"""Ich hatte mich entschieden mein Auto zu verkaufen und nachdem mein Vater davon erfuhr, wollte er es mir abnehmen. Nach vielem Herumtelefonieren und in Warteschlagen von Servicehotlines stecken, hatte ich irgendwann alle Informationen über Unterlagen die wir bei der Ummeldung des Autos brauchen werden zusammen. Bei der Versicherungsfirma angekommen, fand sich schnell ein Herr der sich meinem Anliegen annahm. Ich erklärte ihm, was mir zuvor am Telefon gesagt wurde. Nach längerem Nachfragen des Herrn und Unverständnis seinerseits, stellte sich heraus, dass die Information die ich zuvor am Telefon erhielt falsch war. Dann fragte mich der Herr ob ich den Käufer meines Autos kenne, ich sagte, dass es sich dabei um meinen Vater handelt. Daraufhin veränderte sich die Tonlage dieses Versicherungsmitarbeiters und er sagte, mit einer Stimme die man heutzutage nicht einmal mehr bei Kleinkindern, sondern maximal bei seinen Haustieren verwendet: ""Na dann, muss der Papa kommen und sich selber darum kümmern"". Daraufhin stand ich auf und wollte einfach sofort diese Filiale verlassen, als er mir, in derselben Tonlage, beim Weggehen noch sagt: ""Ich kanns dir auch aufschreiben, wenns dann einfacher verständlich ist"". Ich war so wütend auf die Art und Weise wie dieser Mann mit mir sprach, dass ich kein Wort mehr heraus bekam und einfach ging. Nachträglich bereue ich, dass ich ihn nicht gefragt habe, wieso er es nötig hat, mit einer Frau auf derart respektlose und degradierende Weise zu sprechen.""⁠

488,488,"I’ve been in bed since Monday and have had a lot of time to think about things. So now I have some shit to say- 
1. We can’t pretend to be having #womensupportingwomen and #liftherup conversations if we’re not addressing the fact that the large majority of women in this country still work for someone else. 
Your #girlboss hashtags are cute and all but they don’t do jackshit for the 75 million ladies who don’t have control of their own schedules. (according to 2018 statistics bc a bitch in bed has nothing but google)

2. We just came off a holiday weekend and I have the flu. I called my clients to reschedule appointments. If I’m being real, I was also a little scared to “call out” because I worried they’d think I was just extending my vaycay. That’s what 15 years in #corporateculture will do for ya. In fact, one of my best friends WAS FIRED for calling in sick the day after a holiday weekend, so I know just how detrimental 1 sick day can be. 
3. Not every woman CAN or even WANTS TO work for herself. Remember that when you’re pushing the #beyourownbossbabe mindset. 
4. Pre-K pickup times ARE BULLSHIT. These 2:00 pickups are really killing my productivity and I’m lucky enough to set my own schedule. For those who are required to be at work during set hours, they’re impossible. The effect? Women are often forced to stay home with their children for an additional year, causing further setback in their careers. Those who return to work often do so at an entry-level salary. Otherwise, 25% of women in the US return to work within 2 weeks of giving birth because they can’t afford the UNPAID leave. 
It’s time to overhaul our work culture in this country. It’s time for employers to start treating their staff AS HUMANS + accept that we all get sick, have lives to which we must tend, and above all, we are the backbone of this country. Women aren’t expected to raise the kids, make the meals, and tend to our homes anymore. We’re expected to do ALL THAT + contribute financially. If the crusaders of #womensliberation knew how all this would play out, they’d be disgusted. We have to do better. #paidleave #writeyourcongressperson #supportmoms #equitynotequality",everydaysexism,"|Yeah you said that! ❤️|#fem2 #everydaysexism #theeverygirl #womeninbusiness #thefutureisfemale #goaldigger #womenwholead #liveauthentic #womenwithambition #tcctribe #womenwhohustle #momsupportingmoms|I’m always blown away by what mat leave is like in the US.|So much yes!!!!

I appreciate that culture is pushing women to be brave and start something in regards to businesses- but it’s making almost every woman I know feel like they have to have something on the side. Like we don’t have enough under our belts as it is! And it’s like if they don’t have a side business they aren’t living their life’s passion because that’s what society is telling them.

492,492,"This statue has a kinda sad and beautiful story, but the one I'm going to tell you today is another one, it's the one that happened when I was taking this photo. I was making the best of the moment since there was no tourist groups there at the moment and I could take some clean shots, I walked down a bunch of slippery rocks to try this angle because it seemed a nice one, when I was ready to take the shot, feet secured in gaps to be stable and not slide down and fall to the rocks and then the river because I couldn't grab on anything as I was holding the camera, I heard a tour guide from above, on the bridge, saying to his group of tourist ""yeah there is the fish-man statue, blah blah blah, yeah some girls enjoy snapping his crotch, very well very well"" so here I was, apparently risking falling down and get some nice injuries just to snap a pic of the crotch of a statue.  It probably was just a funny comment, there was not evil in it, I'm not even 100% sure if he said it because of me or if it's something he always says, it probably shouldn't be a big deal, but I don't care. (1/2)",everydaysexism,"|It made me feel stupid, like if the photos I was taking didn't had any value, like if a girl couldn't take things seriously (because before and after me there were several people, several men, in the same spot and several tours with no comments like that one), but it mostly made me mad, I know that my photos aren't great, but at least I try my best. This might seem like a unfortunate comment heard by a overly sensitive girl, but it isn't, I wouldn't be complaining if that was the case, this is one of the hundreds of comments we have to hear every day, for everything we do, and I'm tired, tired of being judged without knowing my situation, tired of having to have to be beyond perfect, tired of being underestimated to the point of underestimating myself. This is not an unfortunate event, this is something that we have to face every day and I'm tired of it. Said that, I thought about dedicating this photo to that jerk, but I changed my mind, I rather dedicate this photo to every girl and women that has to deal with this comments, to every girl and women that, as the fish-man, didn't give up their because of the comments of the ones that didn't even know them.

500,500,"Review: Everyday Sexism by Laura Bates ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⁣
⁣
This amazing piece of feminist literature is based on a project called Everyday Sexism. Hundreds of women, and even more unfortunately, girls, wrote in to share their experiences of sexual abuse, catcalling, physical abuse, and pure fear, which they have experienced, simply due to being female. These included in the family home, school, work and just on the street. ⁣
⁣
This book is one that will stay with me forever, and that I think everyone should read. I have only knocked it a star because sometimes I found it so hard to read, but pushed myself as I think it’s so important. Feminism is something that many people have strong feelings about. And I urge anyone who thinks feminism is pointless, or a hate crime against men - to read this. ⁣❤️

Jeg er afsted et par timer en-to gang om ugen. Det er det. Jeg ved ikke om det er en forargelse over at jeg, som kvinde, vælger at bruge min tid på noget andet end mine børn engang imellem, eller en vurdering af at mænd ikke magter forældrerollen alligevel, men jeg føler mig rimelig overbevist om at køn spiller ind på spørgsmål og mangel på samme.

.
The first post of our #MythbustingMonday series is here! Why is it that women are branded as “hormonal”, when hormones are simply essential to human functioning? Evidence from the field of neuroscience shows that the male hormone testosterone has a detrimental effect on the cognitive ability to assess risk (an essential aspect of leadership). Plus, studies show that men and women have an equal ability to be logical in decision making!

When writing her book, Diana realised she needed to understand the psychology behind women’s struggles in the workplace. So, she did a psychology degree! 🧠  Her expertise allows her to break down these outdated myths using factual, scientific evidence. .
In the book, she delves further into the psychology of gender biases to provide you with practical solutions #linkinbio #MythbustingMonday #UnderstandDareThrive .

Die Kolleginnen und Kollegen eines Partnerunternehmens sitzen gemeinsam mit unserem Team in einer Besprechung. Vorstellungsrunde.

527,527,"Hey there everyone please help me speak out for equality and call #timesup on everyday sexism in the workplace. I’m responding to a recent interview with @marcopierrewhit  a highly successful and well known Chef. I am  paraphrasing here, but Marco says Male Chefs are faster, stronger,and better under pressure then their female counterparts (#dinosaursareextint 🦕) He does throw in a few patronising compliments to women many of which describe how obedient and con-formative they are, turning up wearing the right uniform etc. Basically giving a patronising pat on the head. Here are some quotes from the article so you can see for yourself. 
Marco Pierre White on Women in the kitchen “They are more consistent than men, when it comes to cooking, because they respect the house more, they do their job. They may not be as fast, they may not be as physically strong,"" Marco Pierre White again: ""The real positive with men is that men can absorb pressure better, that's the main difference, because they are not as emotional and they don't take things personally."" “What tends to happen with females in the kitchen is that they tend to go to larder or they tend to go to pastry, they are not in the main kitchen, and so that's why you see a lot of female pastry chefs... they haven't got the pressure."" So faster, better under pressure and stronger! All good grounds to pay higher salaries and promote men faster!? Sounds like rhetoric for discrimination to me. This is so wrong. Female chefs are a minority in the catering industry and here we have someone in a position of power and influence sending out this message how are things ever going to change? 
Why make the comparison in the first place? Is it; to put women off? To pay them less? Or to put them in their place! Or a combination of all the above? 
I also love the bit where he says woman respect the home 😂 it’s not the1950’s Marco!

532,532,"""In der siebten Klasse war ich gerade 13 Jahre alt geworden. Zu meinem Geburtstag bekam ich einen Jeans-Minirock geschenkt, die Wahl der beliebten Mädchen im mittleren Westen der USA. An einem schönen Sommerwochenende machte ich mich auf den Weg zum Haus eines Freundes, nachdem ich eine halbe Stunde lang das perfekte Outfit ausgewählt hatte. Ich ging die Straße entlang, auf der ich mein ganzes Leben lang gelebt hatte und fühlte mich zum ersten Mal als Frau. Sobald ich die nächstgelegene verkehrsreiche Straße erreicht hatte, bog ich um die Ecke. Ein Auto kam mir näher, aber ich dachte mir nichts, bis es langsamer wurde und ein Mann sich aus dem Fenster lehnte. Die Zeit hat die Erinnerung an die genaue Formulierung des Mannes verblasst, aber sobald ich seine Worte hörte, sank mein Magen. Er sagte etwas in die Richtung, er wolle mich mit nach Hause nehmen und unter den Rock greifen. Ich fühlte mich schmutzig und nuttig. Ich fühlte Wertlosigkeit und Scham. Meine Füße drehten sich um und ich ging sofort nach Hause, um mich von dem schändlichen Kleidungsstück zu befreien. Es lag jahrelang in meinem Schrank und wartete auf den Tag, an dem ich mich bereit fühlte, um es noch einmal zu versuchen.""⁠

. 
Back in Jan 2018 when Beaux Gris Gris was booking shows in the UK, we were told by a venue that they do not book female-fronted bands as headliners. (One of the many surprising challenges for female bands.) The story blew up and @classicrockmag even invited me to do a guest article. After seeing my post, @greatbritishrnbfestivalcolne reached out and said they were shocked that we were being treated that way and committed to book us for 2019. Little did anyone know that in that short year #BeauxGrisGris would grow and we would be one of the headliners of that festival. Thank you Jason & Paddy for giving us a chance and for supporting women and men in music. Because you believed in us, now other people do too. Forever grateful. ♥️ Greta + BGG & The Apocalypse

I believe it also prevented me seeking full time work because I could see a way of being able to juggle. I’ve been working on re-addressing the balance. I’m hard wired to ensure the jobs in the home are completed, because I’ve always done it. However, over the last few years things have shifted. Thanks for posting @unwomen .

It isnt that woman judge other woman (not that the judgements are a good thing) but the systemic undervaluing of caregiving that is the root of our problems.|🙌🙌🙌 I so agree with this quote. Equality/Feminism isn’t about women not being in the home and caring for their children, it’s about women being able to CHOOSE to be at home and care for their children if that’s what suits them and their family situation. Care giving as a valid choice 🙌🙌🙌|100%. Work CAN be liberating but it isn’t inherently. How many people hate their jobs and would rather spend more time with their family? (Women AND men!) Now we outsource care for pay (those who can afford childcare, house cleaning, etc) which also gives the government something new to tax that previously wasn’t. Rarely do I see that aspect reflected in feminist theory, at least in my experience. I love my work, but it’s only PART of my life. Being a mom and raising my kids is equally important.|We also need equality in the home. My husband and I both work full time but I still do a huge chunk of the caregiving.

Die Bar ist voll, es ist kaum ein Tisch frei, der Freund sagt uns, seine Runde ist gerade am Gehen und wir könnten ihren Tisch haben. Wir holen uns ein Getränk und folgen ihm. Dort sitzen zwei junge Männer, wirken recht betrunken und müde, an ihrem Handy. Einer der beiden sieht meine Freundin, blüht sichtlich auf und steht sofort auf, um ihr seinen Platz anzubieten. Sie setzt sich hin und wir plaudern mit meinem alten Freund weiter. Ich zünde mir eine Zigarette an, worauf der junge Mann, der jetzt hinter uns steht angewidert das Gesicht verzieht und sagt: „Du rauchst?“. Ich lache und nicke, er dreht sich zu meiner Freundin und fragt, ob sie das auch mache. Sie verneint, woraufhin er ihr über den Kopf streichelt und sagt: „Bist ja ein braves Mädchen.“ Ich starre ihn an und werde unglaublich wütend. Ich sage ihm, er solle das zurücknehmen, er verdreht die Augen und wirkt genervt. Unser gemeinsamer Freund, der uns zum Tisch gebracht hat, sagt ihm er soll gefälligst aufhören und still sein und entschuldigt sich bei uns für das Verhalten seines Freundes.

I had a few surprises though, I often buy books from the site so I know it’s really random exactly what kind of condition you get and whether you get a hardback or paperback. So when I received a hardback signed first edition of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness I was shocked, like how cool is that when I expected a paperback. Also I randomly got The Little Book of Lykke and I didn’t order it so I have no idea what happens there, but I’m not complaining because it looks interesting (maybe it was supposed to be thrown away or something because it looks pretty shabby and has coffee rings all over it). 🤷🏻‍♀️

I og med at kun 10 av 100 voldtektsofre i Norge i det hele tatt anmelder betyr det at mer enn 99% voldtektsmenn går fri❗En Amnesty rapport viser at det er nærmest straffefrihet for voldtekt og vold mot kvinner i Norge og resten av verden.

Det viser politiet og regjeringa hvor høye tallene er så de blir nødt til å prioritere sakene mer og straffeforfølge flere!

a hotline to protect Spanish speakers afraid to report sexual child abuse due to the threat of being deported was released 1800-248-4100. i was asked to speak at the press release “No Te Quedes Callado” meaning “Don’t Stay Quiet”.
.
what words could i possibly express to bring light to ones present or tuning in? i closed my eyes, felt a sense of formlessness & asked God to use me as his instrumet bringing love and healing in the form of words.
.
i allowed the pen to skate on snowy white paper. it wouldn’t come off until past midnight when it was finished. As I read the swirls that manifested into rhyme, i felt a warm sensation expand within my entire being. i was reading it for the first time, as though it had been written for me. what medicine, what healing. the same i felt again when speaking it out loud at the event.
to have some come to me and express “I have never told anyone”…left me astonished on the power of love in form of words. what devine gift to receive these words. what blessing to witness such courage and healing happen before my eyes. that miracles are our lifestyle…constantly manifesting.
.
i met a man who told me that he believed that love was being heard and seen. So, i say thank you for hearing me, for seeing me, and ultimately for loving me. i see and hear you too.

Just in so-called “liberal” academia women & esp #poc women are excluded mainly thru: 1. Men’s preference for men 2. Skepticism about women’s abilities (“prove it again”) 3. Harassment 
I personally left both academia & corp America because of the constant “prove it again” BS I had to face as a woman (not to mention the harassment). That’s why I’m starting a new arts org🙌@mosaicnycart🙌with @federico_solmi @johannesdeyoung & @kjbaysa_life.lived to promote a more inclusive arts ecosystem based on the idea of the artist’s artist. 💥Stay tuned💥

Harassment in the first degree is a class B misdemeanor.

Sexual assault includes attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. For example when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.

Consent occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. For example, a person under a low mental age, or under the legal age of sexual consent may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law.

Some people don’t understand the mental anguish a person goes through when they feel defenseless.|Oh no I would cop his dick off! This conversation is still rapey, kick rocks fucker eww wtf I am sorry you went thru that. Your lucky you weren’t my friend then I would’ve killed him! 💯",13

.
Who is YOUR hero? I think I just found my new one😊
.
Honestly guys, up until a few days ago, I really didn't appreciate Cher. I knew her face, I'd heard her biggest hits, and I enjoyed her in ‪Moonstruck‬- that was about the extent of my familiarity.
.
WELL. Last weekend I went to Vegas for a work trip😏 On the itinerary was a critical, completely work-related function ‪Friday evening‬...at the Park MGM...in the theater...Cher was there...you know, singing and stuff.
.
Y'all....I was FLOORED by Cher's talent. Like, still trying to pick my jaw up off the ground, amazed.
.
The woman is 73. She's up there, doing her thing, and doing it WELL. Her music moved me. She exuded confidence unlike anyone I've ever seen, but her stage presence isn't even what impressed me the most...
.
Cher kicked off the show with a personal story, filled with words of encouragement to all women. She described times when she was rejected for not being adequately ""sexy,” told she was too old, that somehow, even being the POWERHOUSE that she is, that she wasn't ""enough."" She told the audience she keeps performing to show girls out there that they DO NOT have to meet society’s timeline or expectations. That it’s NEVER too late to pursue your dreams. To press on, despite the haters.
.
Lemme just say that Cher is one FRIGGIN' strong bee if I've ever seen one. I hate to speak for her, but I'm confident she'd tell you to look in the mirror and you'll find one there as well.
.
SO, now I wanna hear from you, bees! Who are your heroes? Who has inspired YOU lately?
.
.
.
.
PS- This is my official plea to feature Cher on @armchairexppod She would be SUCH an interesting interview and I'm quite positive the universe wants the Cher-Miniature Mouse connection to happen!🙏🙏🙏

Even though I could not see it in this photo it may have been there hiding in the shadows and a (female) nipple in the shadows is still a sexual nipple according to Instagram!

571,571,"Ligestillingen er helt på røven i Danmark og det kan være vildt svært at vise og forklare alle de små situationer, man som kvinde oplever hver dag, hvor man bliver underkendt, modarbejdet eller framet af sit køn. Men her er et eksempel. Nu har Jeppe Hein lavet et nyt konceptuelt værk som minder utrolig meget om Sophie Duponts Marking Breath. Det påpegede jeg over for Michael Touber som frejdigt delte Jeppes forstående tur til NY med værket, helt uden at nævne Sophie. Min tanke bag min første kommentar var, at hvis det var mig der var blevet så tydeligt kopieret, og overset, ville jeg ønske der var nogen der sagde noget, så jeg ikke stod alene med problemet. 
Michael Touber er en magtfuld hvid mand der sidder centrum af København og har sit på det tørre. At opfordre mig til lige at trække vejret er utvetydigt at indikere at jeg er hysterisk. 
Naturligvis spiller han på det kort, at værkerne handler om åndedræt, men han indikerer at jeg er opfarende, skal tage en chill-pill, og dermed at jeg gør et stort nummer ud af en lille ting. Dermed forklejner han det reelle problem og forskyder det fra sagen - som er at vi har en kultur hvor kvindelige kunstneres værker er til fri afbenyttelse uden behørig credit - til mig som person. Jeg ødelægger den gode stemning og får en utvetydig mikroaggression lige i ansigtet, endda med Kysseemoji til dessert.

Det gør det utroligt svært at trække vejret. 
Det er med til at tage stemmen - udtryksmuligheden - modet fra mig. Det er et eksempel på de små modstande, man som kvinde møder.

Det kunne have været så fedt, hvis Michael Touber bare havde sagt, ja, vi husker at tage Sophie med.

573,573,"""Ich gehe zu meinem üblichen Gourmetladen am Markt nebenan. Der leicht alkoholisierte Koch und Verkäufer kommt mir schon lächelnd entgegen und fragt, was ich heute möchte. Im Laden sitzt noch ein anderer Mann bei einem Glasl Wein. Als ich ansetze meine Burrata zu bestellen, sagt der Koch „Könntest du mir nur einen Gefallen tun? Bitte nicht falsch verstehen, aber biiiiitte nimm doch deine Brille ab! Damit schaust du so gscheit aus. Ohne Brille schaust du so erotisch aus. Nicht falsch verstehen! Tut mir ja Leid. Aber echt SO EROTISCH(mittlerweile schaut der andere Mann auch her). Sorry, das sagt man nicht. Ich mein ja gar nix. Aber echt, ist nur ein Kompliment, aber ohne Brille schaust du SO EROTISCH aus…“
Ich hab versucht, die unangenehme Situation mit einem Scherz zu beenden, weil ich einfach K.O. war und keine Lust hatte, jetzt die richtigen Worte zu finden – nämlich, dass er bitte aufhören soll und mir das unangenehm ist, aber halt möglichst auf eine Art ausgedrückt, die nicht dazu führt, dass ich mich dann dort nach einer unangenehmen Konfrontation nicht mehr wohlfühle. Habe mich dann aber erst Recht nicht mehr in dem Laden wohlgefühlt, nicht zuletzt weil ich „mitgespielt“ habe und mich so halb dafür schäme, und gehe seither nur noch selten hin. Klassisch lose-lose.""

« Ta jupe est super courte »
« On dirait une pute »
« Tu vas quand même pas sortir comme ça ? »
« C’est pas la peine de mettre une jupe si tu tires dessus quand tu marches »
« Faudra pas s’étonner si tu te fais toucher la teucha dans le métro »
« C’est à cause de filles comme toi qu’il y a des violeurs »
« T’es pas un peu vieille pour mettre des jupes avec des mots dessus ? »
« Et après on s’étonne qu’il y a des filles qui disparaissent »
Voilà, voilà le quotidien des filles qui s’habillent comme elles veulent. De ces « putes » qui osent mettre des mini jupes. Putain mais elles sont folles ! Elles se croient où là ?
C’est dingue qu’en 2019 on soit encore obligées d’entendre de genre de remarques, qu’on les répète dans sa tête, qu’elles nous blessent, qu’on finisse vraiment par croire que « ouai j’avoue c’est sûrement trop court ».
Une veille amie à moi dirait « ALLO ? NON MAIS ALLO ? » 😲 si tu veux sortir avec un short à la Nabila c’est TON CHOIX. Que les autres approuvent ou pas ce n’est pas TON problème.
Dans ma rue il y a souvent ces gros porcs qui passent leur journée à boire des cafés et fumer la chicha. Quand ils me voient passer ils bloquent et me regardent comme si je m’étais transformée en Big Mac dégoulinant de fromage fondu.
Souvent, pour ne pas avoir à monter en pression à cause de leur comportement, je change de trottoir et je fais un détour pour rentrer chez moi. La vérité ? Je voudrais leur brûler les yeux pour toujours.
À toutes les mamans, sœurs, épouses, c’est à NOUS d’éduquer ceux pour qui on pense que c’est peine perdue. J’y crois plus que jamais. A tous les hommes qui sont ici, je sais que beaucoup d’entre vous sont du même avis, c’est votre rôle aussi de blâmer vos potes, cousins, oncles, parents, enfants qui manquent de respect aux femmes et qui font des raccourcis inappropriés. #AllMenCan

575,575,"Viel häufiger als direkte, sexualisierte Zurufe erhält man in Graz vermutlich unnötige Kommentare zu seinem Lebensstil und öffentlichen Auftreten. Oft sind es ältere Menschen, die meinen, es gäbe eine bestimmte Art zu leben und auszusehen und jede „Abnorm“ davon sei unangebracht. Als hätten sie das Recht, die Jugend mit ihrer Lebenserfahrung zu belehren, tadeln sie einen, wenn die Hose zu kurz und das Tattoo zu groß ist oder eben die Hand die Hand des „falschen“ Geschlechts hält.
Als wir „Schwule Sau“ auf die Sackstraße schreiben, kommt auch ein älterer Herr vorbei und fragt, was wir hier machen. Wir erzählen ihm geduldig was Catcalls sind und das jemand genau hier auf Grund seines Auftretens beschimpft wurde. Wir wollen darauf aufmerksam machen, dass sowas nicht in Ordnung geht.
Daraufhin nickt der ältere Herr lächelnd und sagt: „Na, dann bin ich ja froh, dass jemand euren Freund eine schwule Sau genannt hat, sonst hätte ich euch zwei Mädels jetzt gar nicht ansprechen können!“ Wir stehen mit großen Augen da und wissen nicht, wie reagieren. Botschaft überhaupt nicht angekommen..
Er bleibt noch eine Weile bei uns stehen, fragt beharrlich immer wieder ob wir noch zur Schule gehen oder studieren — als würde er eine zusätzliche Bestätigung brauchen, dass wir definitiv noch so richtig jung sind — und geht dann irgendwann weiter, denselben dummen Satz nochmal lächelnd wiederholend.
Wir hoffen inständig, dass der Großteil der Menschen, die an diesem Tag beim Kastner & Öhler vorbeigegangen sind, unsere Botschaft richtig verstanden haben: Als die Beleidigung, die „Schwule Sau“ ist, als eine Aussage die man sich sparen kann und in unseren Straßen nichts verloren hat. Wir dürfen aussehen wonach wir uns fühlen, Händchen halten mit wem wir wollen und lieben wen wir lieben. Das zu akzeptieren können wir von unseren Mitmenschen erwarten.

I grew up the youngest of four, two of which are boys.⁣ I shared a room with my brothers on and off ⁣
until I was 22. ⁣
⁣
As a kid, I knew no difference between my brothers and I. ⁣
My father would sit me down next to the car as he was working, teaching me everything he would my brothers. ⁣
⁣
He taught me to drive big boats, fix things on cars, fish, and navigate charts. ⁣
⁣
He taught me I had a right to understand the machinists⁣
 He taught I had a right to fight for justice.⁣
⁣
 I was 21 I went through a  relationship, and breakup that left me hollow.⁣
⁣
I didn't know my worth yet.⁣ I didn't know how to navigate my body ⁣
to listen for when its time to leave.⁣
⁣
My fears where so loud,  crushing my intuition.⁣
⁣
I’d wind up at his house post breakup, waking to my skin covered in shame moulded with regret. ⁣
⁣
Slowly shaving pieces of the self worth I had left.⁣
⁣
I called ⁣
My father ⁣
Please pick me up.⁣
⁣
He’d come scoop me up into his car. Holding space while his baby girl crumbled to dust in the passenger seat. I’d eventually settle from a hurricane, to a looming thunder. ⁣
Thats when he would look at me straight in the eyes saying,⁣
⁣
“I know honey, it hurts like you couldn't image. I know.’’⁣
⁣
Unjudged, not shamed, simply understood.⁣
⁣
When I’m asked, or better yet told. ⁣
“there are good ones out there.” “not all men are bad”⁣
or my personal favourite, ⁣
“Your just a broken hearted girl who's had a bad experience with men, a disgrace the word feminist” ⁣
⁣
No, Im a woman who knows exactly what a strong feminist man looks like. ⁣
I was raised by one who showed me how to walk with my spine straight, head high.⁣
I do not have room, or time for men who try to push my head into the water. ⁣
⁣
I’ll bite your fucking hand off, my daddy showed me how.⁣ ⁣

585,585,"[ For you, Woman ]

The enemy of the modern woman is not men. It is not women who like cooking and fashion.

The enemy is stereotypes that come from all places and that tell you to be one way or the other. The enemy is really sexist people. The enemy is the version of yourself that does not stand up to it.

Last month I was on call. I called an on call colleague of a different specialty for an urgent patient consult. Before I was able to say anything, he refused, saying he is busy, and hang up.

I called him back and explained my patient’s case. He asked me to save my breath, hand him someone else because he cannot take a “woman’s talk”
...
I did not. He came to see the patient briefly after our conversation.

What matters is not how I handled it.

To me, what matters is to share a lesson learned. Maybe be a reminder to someone. Perhaps an awakening to another.

Dear woman, Speak up.

Do not shut yourself up.

Because for every little victory, you contribute in creating a new, fair, just and mostly correct stereotype for all Women.

590,590,"Yesterday a poorly misinformed man at the beach seemed to think he had the right to take pictures of myself and my roommate without our consent (and then lie about it...and refuse to delete all the pictures). I know in the grand scheme of things, this is lower on the list of invasive behaviors, but it’s still incredibly violating and nerve wracking.  Incidents like this reinforce the notion that our bodies are somehow meant for the enjoyment of others, and that certain outfits/actions/words forfeit our right to privacy and respect. 
This is just a friendly little PSA to remind everyone:
1.  Your body is yours, and yours alone
2. If you see something speak up. Trust your gut because you are probably right
3. And lastly, if you like the swimsuit, buy the damn thing, rock the hell out of it, and don’t take sh*t from anybody

605,605,"How much for a night? Part 3/3. By Kamana Rai. #powerinme #selfassertionmonth -------------------
In the end, he offers me an apology for asking my price for the night. The apology is mostly insincere so I walk back to the room. I continue fuming with anger, but I am also feeling a twinge of shame and embarrassment. This part feels the worst. I do not want to feel shame but I do. 
My thoughts immediately run to my attire. Despite being a proud feminist, the shame I feel weakens me. My mind goes to a place I do not like. I start questioning my choice of outfit. I regret wearing what I am. I regret hanging out with so many men. I regret being there. It takes me much longer than I would like to realise that it was neither my outfit nor my behaviours that caused the incident; it was the man, he was the problem, not me. 
I need to disown the blame for it has no place in my mind or body. Unfortunate as it seems, the horrible incident has given me knowledge and strength should I face harassment again in the future. I know if any of it happens again that I won't need time nor the help of men to defend myself and my choices. .

Nach vielen Jahren habe ich hier auch zum ersten Mal meinen Großonkel wieder gesehen, der am Anfang gleich ein paar rassistische Witze zum Besten gibt. Die Feier ist lang, die älteren Herrschaften werden betrunken. Zum Abschied gibt er meinem Bruder die Hand und sagt: „Schön, dass wir uns gesehen haben!“. Dann setzt er sich hin, ich gehe zu ihm und will mich verabschieden. „Du hast dich eigentlich ganz gut entwickelt,“ sagt er. „Hast ein schönes Gstöll gekriegt.“ Dabei legt er die Hand um meine Hüfte. „Aber dein Rock könnte schon ein bissl länger sein!“. Mir wird heiß und ich erstarre vor Wut und Schock. Ich bringe mit leiser Stimme hervor: „So kannst du nicht mit mir reden!“, bis seine Frau laut über uns drüber redet und ihm sagt, er solle nicht immer so konservativ sein. Ich gehe.""⠀

Abortions though seemed as safe are not good for your body and I don’t think any woman really wants to put herself through that. Besides getting pregnant  for pleasure and fun just to then rip out the embryo out of you like it’s nothing it’s a outraged. As a woman and as a human being I would never want to put my self through that. Unwanted pregnancy’s happen because Woman and men act like irrational beings, we never stop to think of why we are doing is right and about the consequences. Unless of course you experienced forceful sexual  interactions (rape ) that’s different. If that’s the case a woman should have the right to decide other wise please ladies it’s your body and your  emotional, spiritual ama mental state that will suffer and pay the consequences with time as safe as you have been told  abortions are. Stop having sex with man who don’t understand how sacred and precious you are.  stop having sex and unprotected sex just because you are sad, lonely, depressed, bored, drunk, high, under pressure and desperately in need of attention and affection. Liberate yourselves and learn to give that to your self first, learn self love self respect self admiration and then you will attract the right person for you. Someone who can see how precious and amazing you are. Someone who you can share your thoughts, feelings, dreams, hopes and your body the responsible way with.

My men expect so much of me because of the image they have made of me and that I have made of myself, as a sex symbol. 
Men expect so much and I can’t live up to it. 
They expect bells to ring and whistles to whistle, but my anatomy’s the same as any other woman’s.

Swiftly moving on to another book this month after the disaster of the last book, ‘Sometimes I Lie’ by Alice Feeney 🤦🏻‍♀️ up next is ‘Girl Up’ by the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project @laura_bates__ 💪🏻💚 a feminist non-fiction work that discusses body image pressures, false representations in media, the complexities of sex and relationships and of course social media, to name a few! I received this book as a gift just before Christmas and I’m so glad I’m finally getting round to reading it - I always love a good unapologetic book so I have no doubt this will be added to my collection of favourites 👏🏻📚

625,625,"""Meine Klasse in der Schule hatte einen ganz besonderen Kochlehrer. Er war grundsätzlich sehr freundlich, zu den Schülerinnen war er zum Teil ganz besonders 'freundlich'. In kürzester Zeit wurden anzügliche Kommentare und Angebote seinerseits alltäglich und mit einem beschämten Lächeln abgetan. Nach und nach ging er jedoch einen Schritt weiter und es kam zu 'Streicheleinheiten' an Rücken und Armen. An eine Kochstunde kann ich mich noch besonders erinnern - der Kochlehrer sagte mir, ich soll ein bestimmtes Küchengerät verwenden, dieses befand sich in der untersten Lade meiner Kochzeile. Ich drehte meinem Lehrer den Rücken zu um das Gerät aus der Lade zu holen und bückte mich. Anstatt zu warten, dass ich es hervorhole, bückte sich dieser Lehrer über mich drüber, wodurch seine gesamte vordere Körperhäfte an meiner gesamten hinteren Körperhälfte lag, und griff nach dem Gerät. Ich spürte alles und sagte aber nichts. Nachdem sich Vorfall an Vorfall reihte, schwankte die Stimmung in der Klasse von einem 'Weglächeln' zu Ärger. Es wurde dem Direktor mitgeteilt, dass er sich bitte die Zeit nehmen soll, um zu uns in die Klasse zu kommen, da wir etwas mit ihm zu besprechen haben. Der Direktor kam, nahm sich einen Sessel und setzte sich vor unsere Klasse und fragte, was wir ihm denn sagen wollen. Stille. Keine Schülerin traute sich den Anfang zu machen. Nachdem ich meinen ganzen Mut zusammen nahm, fing ich an zu reden und erzählte von dem oben beschriebenen Vorfall und betonte, dass Situationen dieser Art regelmäßig passieren. Darauf folgten ein paar Mitschülerinnen mit ihren Geschichten. Nachdem die letzte Schülerin, die bereit war etwas zu sagen, fertig sprach, sagte unser Direktor: ""Also, das ist mir jetzt sehr unangenehm. Ich weiß nicht genau wie ich damit umgehen soll. Ich werde das an euren Klassenvorstand weiterleiten"" und sofort verließ er die Klasse. Es passierte überhaupt nichts und dieser Lehrer unterrichtete uns bis zu unserer Fachprüfung.""

Whilst on a walk with our dogs, we once again told each other about our latest unpleasant experiences. But this time, our frustration became unbearable - it had been one sexist remark too much.

633,633,"In recent years, feminist movements have attracted significant attention in Europe and North America. So why do so many young women still say they do not identify with the term? Fewer than one in five young women would call themselves a feminist, polling in the UK and US suggests. That might come as a surprise to some, as feminism has seemingly been steadily gaining mainstream attention lately. So it is perhaps unexpected that the identity ""feminist"" has not gained more popularity among young women in the Western world. Across Europe, fewer than half of men and women polled in five countries agreed they were a feminist. This ranged from 8% of respondents in Germany, to 40% in Sweden. However, people do not appear to reject the term feminism because they are against gender equality or believe it has been achieved. The same study found that eight out of 10 people said men and women should be treated equally in every way. If many believe gender equality is important, and still lacking, then why do relatively few people - including young women - identify as feminist?It could be that they do not feel the term speaks to them. The term feminist is less likely to appeal to working-class women, polls suggest. One-in-three women in higher income brackets identify as feminists while one-in-five women in lower income homes reject the label outright. These same women say they support gender equality but don't see the feminist movement as particularly helpful or relevant to them. Research into the views of US millennials found 12% of Hispanic women, 21% of African American women, 23% of Asian women and 26% of white women identify as a feminist. Many of those polled said they felt feminism had been helpful to white women but not to other minority groups. The greatest factor involved in women rejecting the feminist label however, are the negative connotations associated with it. Many of the women polled see feminism as associated with lack of femininity and synonymous with man-hating. These negative connotations have been fueled by the actions of the feminist movement itself. The image of feminism will improve only when feminists themselves decide to change for the better.",everydaysexism,"|Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-politics-47006912|This isn’t even close to being true lol|#feminism #feminist #metoo #everydaysexism|They’re all in my town|Few fads are actually true.

641,641,"[PARENTING TIPS]: how to raise a feminist son - part I ⁣
⁣
Q: “Why does the mother in the “Berenstain Bears” always wear a housecoat & rarely leave the house?⁣
⁣
A.. Mama 🐻 (@berenstainbears) can wear a housecoat (or whatever she damn well pleases) because her kids ride the bus. 🚌 ⁣
⁣
As for Mama 🐻 leaving the house, a BETTER question is where are Mama 🐻’s friends?⁣
⁣
I think Mama 🐻 & Mommy 🐽 (@officialpeppa) would have plenty to chat, chuckle, & commiserate about: both of their husbands are directionally challenged  mansplainers who rarely listen, & are also rarely right. ⁣

Although, I do think it's simplification of matters. Benefits to whom? There could be a side that benefits while the other suffers. But yes, the end result of an action might be beneficial yet the way an action is brought in existence may be questionable. Like eg, exploiting resources might be beneficial for an economy but the action  may severely damage the environment and compromise on various human rights.|Non-consequential, there is always a middle way⚖️|Non consequentialist. How can I sleep at night knowing that the comfort of my bed has been stained with the tears of others? The food in my stomach is there because others are being denied food in concentration camps right now...so how do I swallow it next time without guilt? Many people think non consequentialist decisions at the end of the day originates from having lofty ideals and living in an utopian society. No. I feel it is a selfish choice you can make for yourself. I am selfish. I cannot unsee things...or unhear things...or even unlearn the hard facts. The truth is that I am privileged if I belong to the majority who aren't facing any human rights violations. Privilege speaks. If the world population becomes half due to a massive genocide - you're privileged and you feel the end result is great and the Earth is going to be amazing now and we'd have beaten Climate Change to an extent.

649,649,"From a young age, girls are told that they cannot be feminine and powerful at the same time.

In adulthood, most career women worry that if they look too feminine, they will not be taken seriously.

That ends now!! It is time to get rid off those ugly suites (you loathe)and dark coloured clothes in your closet and embrace your femininity.

You do not have look manly to prove you are intelligent, capable and smart.

Awareness is what’s going to change the world and how we treat one another. .

Cette étiquette-là s’attache à nous souvent bien avant la ménopause de toute façon. Mais la ménopause, c’est comme un remake de tes pires SPM, avec Charlize Theron dans le rôle-titre.
C’est impératif de comprendre qu’il n’y a rien de personnel dans ce comportement aléatoire. Que c'est pas moi, ni toi, mais un cocktail d'hormones unhinged dans mon corps. Qu’il y a des moments dans la journée où j’ai l’impression de devoir physiquement tenir tous mes morceaux par en dedans.»

692,692,"This is Little A on his way home from his fifth camp of the year. He has eight weeks summer holidays but I don’t have eight weeks leave.⁣
⁣
In a few weeks, he’ll go back to school, which starts every morning at 9am but I leave for work before 7am.  His classes will finish at 2:30pm but his little brother’s classes finish at 1:30pm (yes that’s two separate pick up times) the school has no after-school or before-school childcare available and I don’t get home from work until 5:30pm. ⁣
⁣
So we implement a chaotic and costly system of unpaid leave, finely tuned schedules, private childcare and relying on the kindness of family.  And in this situation I am really totally #blessed - we can afford to pay childcare to allow me to work, we have enormous family support, we can take unpaid leave, we are a two parent family,  the boys are in a lovely crèche.  All the stars have aligned in that respect.⁣
⁣
But despite my very fortunate circumstances and  amazing amount of support: I am constantly exhausted and consumed by guilt because this situation makes me a substandard parent and a substandard employee. ⁣
⁣
It has occurred to me that our entire society - from working norms to school timetables - is entirely set up to accommodate two-parent families where one parent (guess who that tends to be?) stays at home: to cook and clean and shop and iron and do homework and raise children...that’s a full time job right there. ⁣
⁣
For many families, it is more financially viable, more logistically feasible, better even - if a mother (because it’s usually a mother) stays at home, often giving up her career entirely.  All the forces of society work constantly against the model of a two-income family.⁣
⁣
It’s almost as if they don’t really want us to go back to work. ⁣
⁣
In modern Ireland, a mother being able to work is a luxury.  How fucked up is that? ⁣

I could rant all day about this. My husband works in education so we are ‘sorted’ school holiday wise. However, as our children are currently in different education institutions to their father, and due to school still being in an era of working on site alone rather than remote, all drops offs and pickups need to be done by one parent. Having a two year period of the kids being in two different systems and locations and operating hours equates to a logistic migraine. I am very grateful to have a spouse that ‘works’ with me to get all the non paid work done. Yet, it feels like society has a long way to go and that my career will flatline for twenty years because it just is all so archaic|I totally agree! it is f... up! Great read. 👏|All of this.

703,703,"Fellas, fellas, fellas 🤦🏼‍♀️ We’re going to bust a few myths for you right now:

1) Women AREN’T better at multitasking - they just have to do more of it! A new study shows women’s brains are no more efficient at switch between/juggling tasks than men’s are.
2) Women are NOT better at seeing mess than men. In one study, researchers found men and women equally rated a space as messy. The reason men do less cleaning than women may lie in the fact that women are held to higher standards of cleanliness than men, rather than men’s “dirt blindness”. The lesson? We need to dismantle these myths in the workplace. The assumption women are better multitaskers can influence the allocation of administrative tasks. Tasks like taking minutes and organising meetings should not be allocated based on gender.

This little excerpt comes to you from A Trial of Sparks & KIndling. I wrote it quite a while ago, but because of the conversations I've had in the last two weeks and since this is a theme I've also explored in A Study of Ash & Smoke, I just had to share the quote.⁠
⁠
Unfortunately, too many of us reach a point where we no longer know any woman who hasn't been sexually assaulted, belittled, or seen as *lesser* because of her gender. It sucks.⁠
⁠
I want to build a world for my daughter where this isn't the norm anymore. Where rape culture doesn't exist, where the saying 'boys will be boys' won't apply to the harassment of a woman, and where women aren't given the job based on how big their breasts are, but are given opportunities because of their intellect, willpower, and hard work.⁠

715,715,"If feminism fights for equal rights and opportunities, why is the name sexist?

I believe most feminists have been asked this question at least once.

First of all, feminism does not equal equality.

Equality, is among the things feminism fights for.

Feminism is against patriarchy, toxic masculinity, rape culture, eurocentric standards of beauty, period poverty, gender based violence etc

Feminism is for women emancipation, body positivity, body autonomy, equal rights. ""Why not call yourself an egalitarian or a believer in human rights?"" they ask

#icallmyselfafeminist because calling myself an egalitarian will be dishonest!

It will be denying the fact that women and girls for centuries have been the victims of gender.

It will be denying the fact that patriarchy is a problem in itself.

722,722,"""I was discussing feminism once with a guy I was seeing at the time, and he told me that Western feminism doesn't exist, and that we don't need feminism here in North America, that the women on the picket line fighting to close the wage gaps are just complaining about nothing, and that there's nothing in North America that a man can do that a woman can't. I was so enraged I couldn't even tell him how wrong he was. Do men regularly feel unsafe walking alone at night? Do men lack full bodily autonomy and control over their reproductive rights? Do men have to work twice as hard to prove themselves? Do men risk being regularly objectified and sexualized no matter what they're wearing? Do men make less money than women in the same position as them? Do men contend with gender roles that put them in an oppressive or powerless position? Is men's sexual wellbeing grossly misunderstood and considered secondary to women's? The list goes on and on and on....People who are privileged by the very system that serves them are usually blind to it–because that's privilege! They don't have to think about it. And I'm not saying we haven't made progress, and I'm not saying I as a white woman don't have ANY privilege because I know on certain levels I do, but we cannot fix the problem of privilege, sexism, racism, transphobia, or homophobia if the people involved in those systems of oppression don't realize or won't recognize that they are in it. Suffice to say, I dropped his ass immediately."" ⁣

725,725,"Ever wonder why the line is so long for women’s restrooms?⁠⠀
1. Pregnancy and menstruation cause women to have to use the restroom more frequently⁠⠀
2. Women are often responsible for bringing their children to the bathroom⁠⠀
3. Young moms need the space for breastfeeding⁠⠀
⁠⠀
⁠⠀
So why haven’t architects considered the accessibility of women’s restrooms? In newer buildings this is beginning to be addressed, but in old buildings, the building codes required more space for men since women were primarily restricted to the home at the time. Until 2011, even the U.S. House of Representatives didn’t have a women’s restroom near the Speaker’s Lobby, while the men’s closely located restroom had a fireplace, a shoeshine stand, and televised floor proceedings.⁠⠀

#pottyparity #everydaysexism #genderinequality",everydaysexism,"|THIS! As a breastfeeding and postpartum mom these struggles are all too real for me! So many little details in life now make me feel unconsidered by the powers that be. Parking lots, bathrooms, entrances, the list goes on.",47
726,726,"We “leant in”... but did it fail us? I was one of a generation of women who devoured Lean In (and other similar literature). I embraced the ethos. I joined the circles. I didn’t “lean out” before I had “leant in”. As per Sandberg’s advice, I didn’t think about how having children would impact my career. 
I’m lucky: my employer is a great support for working parents. But for so many, this isn’t the case. Many parents (particularly mothers) look to workplaces for flexibility, be that part-time work, the ability to leave early, or working from home. But in so many traditionally “male-dominated” industries – those which Sandberg encouraged women to lean into – there’s a reluctance to cater to those requests. Or if flexible working is accepted, it’s often offered begrudgingly and frowned upon behind the scenes.

Compare this to stereotypical “female” professions, where employers are much more open to flexible working. This means mothers are more likely to want to – and feel that they are able to – stay in their career, and progress while having a young family.

On the flip side, women in inflexible industries/companies seem to face one of two choices. The first is to accept full-time work and outsource childcare: fine if that’s what you want, but research shows that many mothers don’t, especially when their partner also works full-time. There are a multitude of studies on the negative impact of this forced choice on women’s mental health and stress levels. The second choice is to take time out, or to find a flexible alternative elsewhere, both of which tend to negatively limit future earning potential. These women often end up forcibly leaning out more than women who had considered the impact of children on their career pre-pregnancy.

This isn’t how it should be, but how it is (depressingly). It’s what campaigns like #FlexAppeal aim to address (hurrah!). But with so many employers so stuck in the past, is the reality that without thinking about “leaning out”, many women have jeopardised themselves? Would planning for the impact of a family and being realistic about the state of today’s workplace allow women to navigate long-term career prospects more effectively?",everydaysexism,"|•

Planning is good but dual income families and long hours are the norm and we all (businesses, governments & families) have to figure out how to make that work...|Such a tricky question. I fear planning wouldn’t make a difference. I left the corporate workplace when my first child was born and I haven’t gone back, not because my workplace didn’t want to be flexible, but because I MYSELF don’t see how I could have effectively done my job and continued to progress, without working full time, and like many other women in the research you mention, I didn’t want to work full time. Even now at 5 and 7 when my kids are in school I don’t want to - because in our country the kids come home for lunch and they don’t have school two afternoons a week and they want me to be there for them in those times. And I want to be there for them.",32

That in the 21st century this is still a problem is almost too ridiculous to be believable. It’s also ridiculous that it took me years to realise that what I experienced at 14! was sexual assault and not in any way, shape or form normal! This is a collection of stories that sparked many different emotions in me: I felt angry, defeated, hopeless, sad and powerless... but by the end it also gave me hope, it helped me gain perspective, it ignited a fire in me and it inspired me to find ways to be more active and to use my voice for the causes in believe in, even if I have to shout to do so. ✊🏻✊🏽✊🏿 Questo libro mi ha aiutata ad avere un quadro più completo riguardo il sessismo che molte donne devono sopportare quotidianamente ed è straziante, disgustoso e ripugnante. Il fatto che nel 21esimo secolo questo sia ancora un problema è quasi troppo ridicolo per essere credibile. È altrettanto ridicolo che mi ci siano voluti anni per rendermi conto che ciò che ho subito a 14 anni fosse violenza sessuale e che non sia in alcun modo ok! Questa raccolta di storie ha scatenato molte emozioni in me: mi sono sentita arrabbiata, sconfitta, senza speranze, triste e impotente... ma alla fine mi ha anche dato speranza, mi ha aiutata ad avere più prospettiva, ha acceso un fuoco in me e mi ha ispirata ad essere più attiva e a usare la mia voce per cause in cui credo, anche se significa che devo urlare. •

742,742,"@sikemi.o describes herself as a change catalyst, one devoted to making positive changes in her life, the lives of all around her and most especially Nigeria. She frequently describes herself in the words of Donovan Livingston as “being a thorn in the side of injustice”. She graduated from Louisville Girls High School in 2017 and recently graduated from @oxbridgetc where she completed her foundation and recently made top ten results with all As, and also joined the @swortetalks Team. 
She is going to University to study Law, as she hope she will later work with the International Court of Justice to ensure that leaders who violate human rights or do not serve as proposed face consequences of these actions, due to her believe that leaders form the government and the government indirectly shapes the lives of the citizens, nonetheless she believes that citizens should act if their governments fail to. 
Her zeal for justice is a defining and evident attribute of hers, proof of this comes from her selection as one of the 6 GirlChampions across the nation awarded with the GirlChild Award 2018 by the British High Commission. She also graduated with the the Ambassadorial award from her school. 
She believes in making changes in areas even those that may not directly affect us and thus she co-founded theilluminatemvmnt, a growing platform to educate people on diseases, disabilities and all related with the major aim of pushing for inclusion and empowerment of disabled persons. 
Her favorite quote is by Martin Luther King Jr. which says that “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter” °

Since I started Weightlifting I've struggled to understand what it must've been like for female lifters training before women were allowed to lift in the Olympics, which again was only in 2000.🥇
.
It's totally normal for me to have elite lifters of my gender to fangirl at 😍 but they didn't have any.
.
Imagine being told by society that it doesn't matter how strong/fast/skilled you are, your sport doesn't count because you don't have a Y chromosome.🙅🏼‍♀️🏆
.
Even though I have my own issues with CrossFit, I feel like I have to give some due to the sport with popularising Weightlifting, for women especially, and with glamourising strong women.
.
Yes, sport is about physical ability. And yes, men are typically naturally stronger/faster than women, but come on, the attitude that says female sporting achievements deserve less recognition is seriously dated. You can't get away with asking us to make the tea for a meeting anymore ☕, so cut this crap out too. 👍
.
Besides, I'm a little 50kg girl and can outsquat half the guys in my work gym, so if it's some of those lads who are sneering at women's professional football/tennis/swimming, they haven't got a leg to stand on. #stopskippinglegdaylosers

748,748,"Half of female tech workers have been told they’re “too pretty” for the industry, The Independent reports.
•
The survey, carried out by tech recruiter CWJobs, revealed all kinds of everyday sexism that women in the industry have experienced.
•
58% of the 2000 women surveyed said they’d been asked or overheard someone asking if their mood was related to their “time of the month”, and over a third have been asked by a male colleague: “Sorry, am I being too technical for you?”

When we found her designs it was MANDATORY to get at LEAST one of them - we would be lying if ONE didn't turn into 4 - but who's counting, right? She designs them herself and puts a lot of love into - well - EVERYTHING - the package we received our pins was simply amazing and we thought we can't keep her a secret for so long. This is totally not an Ad -we are just fangirling over here and thought you'd appreciate it too. So hop over to her Etsy store.

751,751,"Blame her dress:- @homicidalwriter
A beautiful charming lady stepped in line
In temple to get blessed 
The guy behind her back touching her private parts cleverly, making her stressed 
If she complains people's arrow is on her dress 
She can’t scream she can’t fight her in the middle 
Escaping this type of society is a riddle
One girl working hard for her family 
Want to build her home 
Like bird makes a nest 
She really feels uncomfortable 
When her boss is staring at her breasts 
One lady walking down the street 
She had a long day in office 
Driver looking deliberate at her legs 
She wishes him to stop it 
When she notices 
Wolf craving for her body, she smells 
And one woman turned into a rebel 
Whose skin was like honey 
Some guy kidnapped her and sold her for money 
And society making statements 
None of them is true 
She came late because of her work 
She deserves respect on the basis of her virtue 
And even if she was with boys 
Eating drinking or partying all night 
Why you’re making points about her character 
It is a democratic nation, she knows what's wrong or what's right •

755,755,"I've had my bra straps snapped and swimsuit strings untied in a public pool by guys ""just being guys""
I've taken a lift home with one of my best guy friends, only for him to stop in an empty field and force me to give him a blowie. I didn't want to be raped, so I did it. It was my first time. I didn't tell anyone, because I didn't think anyone would believe me. 
I've walked home alone, not sure if I'd make it there alive. 
I've been catcalled (even when with my kids). I've had men whistle at me from cars, only to be sworn at if I didn't respond to their ""compliments"". I have sat in a train car while a man masturbated while looking directly at me. 
I've been slapped on the ass while waitressing. 
I've had my drink spiked while out with my girlfriends. I locked myself in the bathroom before everything went black. 
I've had a famous rugby player who is twice my size pick me up against a wall in a club, and grind against me while trying to take my panties off. 
8 years ago, on my birthday, I went out with two girlfriends. I just had my daughter 8 months before, and wanted to feel part of the world again. A man slipped his hand into my dress by the bar and started groping me. I struggled to push him off, everyone could see - no one helped. I slapped him, and he threw me to the ground and swore at me while his friends laughed nervously. I was too afraid to leave the club, I was afraid that he would follow me to my cab. My husband and 8 month old daughter had to come fetch me in town, in the middle of the night. If things took a turn for the worse they would say that it was because I was showing off my cleavage, or because I had no place being in a club as a mother. That I deserved it.  I haven't gone out with friends since.
Womens month is nothing to celebrate. We should be angry.

We also need to be afraid. Fear helps us run. It helps us avoid unsafe situations in the first place. It is a critical survival emotion for human beings to access in healthy, appropriate doses.

We need our anger too. Anger protects us, and it restores us. It gives us our dignity. It sets boundaries. It takes action. It insists on change. It makes a scene. It demands attention.",everydaysexism,"|Thank you for posting this, saying it as it is.

762,762,"Earlier this year I was privileged to speak @hubdot @petershamnurseries about how really connecting with people was my number one focus for 2019 and beyond. So often, it’s easy to meet with friends, family and work colleagues and pass pleasantries. We British love to greet with ‘ How are you?’ But not intend an answer other than ‘fine thanks’! I find this tradition can lead to conversation devoid of meaning, as often the opportunity to connect deeply is lost with the first exchange. 
What if with each interaction we intend a deep connection that can enhance our belonging and filter out any feeling of isolation? And what if we can be inspired, learn, help others, or just laugh out loud through these deep connections. 
I’ve just finished reading Melinda Gates book ‘The Moment Of Lift’
@melindafrenchgates 
In her closing paragraphs she talks about connection being more important than equality. And I have to agree, however, in order to understand Melinda’s point fully, read the book, it is one of the most important books I’ve read in recent times. 
If you’d like to attend a @hubdot event where people come together devoid of labels, so that deep connection can be made through the stories told, then Scroll through to see the date for their next event @londonkindred partnering with one of my favourite brands @thomsonandscottuk Some of my best connections have been down to the excellent work @simona__hub_dot and team do. ❤️❤️ .

766,766,"""It was just a few weeks after we had given our twelfth board exams and were preparing for entrances.
One evening, I was talking to a school mate over the phone, who happened to be a friend back then. Like usual, we were generally joking about the school days and discussing the exam strategies and the expected grades in final exams. 
Out of no where, to my surprise, he said something that was the least expected of him and that left me blank for sometime.
Well,  in the most casual manner he said- "" why do you girls these days work so hard in all the possible fields, when you know that in the end you have to marry a rich man who is well to do?""
I was at first shocked to hear such a statement for i was always taught the importance of being independent by my parents; but I also wondered about the audacity he had to make a statement so audacious without any thought and shame.
We did have an argument on that; yet he stuck to defend himself. 
We hardly spoke after that day for he went a bit too ahead in order to just prove himself right .

But what's more is the fact that this incident made me realize how sexism is deep-rooted and exists in the most casual forms which we at times tend to ignore or not make a note of;  and this goes on to degrade the mentality even further."" #EsaTohHotaHai

767,767,"""Few weeks ago, I met a male friend at a cafe. 
When we went to pay up for our drinks, my friend had some loose change, but I had a 500 rupee note, I asked my friend to give me his share and I paid the bill for the both of us. We had this conversation in front of the cashier, who saw the exchange of money happen as well. I paid her the money, but when it came to returning the remaining amount and giving the bill, she gave *both* to my male friend despite me clearly stating ""Please give me the change.""
It felt like a classic case of people assuming that if a girl and a boy are out together, the boy has got to be the one paying the bill, or is somehow the one in charge.

Common as such incidents may be, they highlight the underlying issue of casual sexism being normalised in our society. The very assumption that if a man and a woman are out together, the man is the one necessarily providing for the woman, by paying her bills, is not only demeaning to the woman, by undervaluing her status of being someone who can look after herself, and pay for herself, but it also places an unfair burden on the man to be the one providing/paying for a woman, while she can look after herself.

Sexism, like most social evils isn't always necessarily blatant. It creeps in little ways like these, where it becomes easier to brush off the problem and say ""Esa to hota hai"" instead of confronting it, because who wants to pick up a fight on something seemingly petty?"" #EsaTohHotaHai .

768,768,"""Back in school, I was working on something with a couple of male friends of mine and instead of helping, they were just sitting there and exchanging ""dank"" jokes and memes. I remember one of the memes was that there were two washroom doors, one had ""men"" written over it and the other said ""kitchen"". I told them how sexist that was. I was completely vexed because it starts with a joke that normalises this patriarchal ideology that we’re holding on to. I told them to go out of the room if they aren't working. And one of them said- “Hum kyun jaaye, teri kitchen hai yeh?"" #EsaTohHotaHai

780,780,"I read somewhere that alpha women like to dominate sexually

Well- I’m an alpha woman - and -

While I love the sense of control I have sexually (she who has the pussy has the control)- I actually enjoy the submissiveness of sex to an alpha male.

For a control freak like me-  this is the only time I am able to let go of control and still get my needs met (and ohhhhh- how they get met 😈) With the right man

With the right communication

With the right level of trust

There is a power in submissiveness- the act of letting go - trusting another person with your body - with your heart - with your soul

To “allow” yourself this level of vulnerability - this level of powerlessness - is the ultimate in intimate power

Chris and I have an agreement - Fuck safe words.  They don’t exist or you are practicing “controlled submission”. Sometimes you have to “let go” and fuck - be controlled - let yourself become totally free and totally immersed into the pleasure of the experience !!

789,789,"Про “единичные” случаи домогательств.
⠀
Наверное, я плохая женщина. Недостаточно суровая. Не могу себя поставить в жизни как ту, которая пресекает все поползновения как только чует их. ⠀
Первый случай, что я помню, произошел, когда мне было 6 лет — левый дед шлепает меня по попе, говорит «какая сладкая девочка». Мне уже тогда стыдно.
⠀
Второе воспоминание — мне 8, гуляем около дома, откуда-то сверху начинают сыпаться монетки, рубль, два, пять — огромные деньги для ребёнка! В какой то момент поднимаю голову узнать, что же это за манна небесная. В окне стоит голый мужик, дрочит и кидает нам монетки.
⠀
Переносимся в мою взрослую жизнь. Я, уже усталая, еду в лабораторию на метро. Удалось сесть, я пытаюсь не заснуть. Напротив стоит мужчина приличного вида, в пальто, руки в карманах. Поезд дергается, полы пальто раздвигаются, я вижу член. Его носитель пугается и как ошпаренный выбегает на следующей остановке.
⠀
Самый запомнившийся случай — я иду в наушниках. Ко мне подходит дед, что-то говорит. Я достаю наушник, чтобы его услышать, спрашиваю «что случилось?». Он жестом предлагает мне наклониться, чтобы сказать на ухо. Я, нехотя, наклоняюсь. Он мне шепчет: «доченька, а можно тебе полизать? Там» и тычет пальцем в сторону моей промежности. Мне противно и стыдно, аж плакать хочется, я быстро ухожу. Но почему-то потом весь день чувствую себя грязной.
⠀
И это не все. Это только то, о чем я захотела рассказать.
⠀
И у большинства девушек/девочек/женщин есть такие истории, только они вам не рассказывают.
⠀
Надеюсь, кто захочет — поделится своими историями в комментариях. Потому что — я не “одна такая”.

Я вспомнила раннее майское утро около ГЗ и мимо проходящего эксгибициониста в плаще. К сожалению, от этого не спрячешься. Всегда будут люди с психическими отклонениями либо просто козлы. 🙄|Жесть 😲. А у Вас все эти случаи происходили в мегаполисе?|Мой мозг из чувства сохранности многие вещи потёр, но из запомнившихся.1) Мне 13 лет.Я на отдыхе ем мороженое  с клубникой ложечкой из красивого бокала на ножке. Мама ушла в туалет. И какой-то изврат за  пару столиков от нашего снимает меня на телефон 2) Мне лет 16. Иду в метро и возле входа в него стоит тачка с распахнутой дверью, где сидит самого обычного бизнесменского вида мужик-в костюмчике,с хуем наперевес 3) Мне 21. Еду в метро в институт.Дикая толкучка.И на выходе кто-то смачно решает потрогать меня за задницу.Я успеваю только повернуть голову и увидеть мужика, который прячет глаза, прежде чем толпа меня вынесла из вагона|Пишите лучше про вино😁|Испанский стыд за мужиков 🙈|Ох, ты совсем не одна. 1 - мне было лет 9, когда на рынке в толкучке кто-то решил целеустремлённо ""помять"" мне попу. Была маленькая и впала в ступор. Потом, когда уже вышли с рынка, пожаловалась бабушке и услышала ""Пф, подумаешь, что такого?"" Было вдвойне обидно, аж до слёз. 2 - уже лет 12 было, когда в электричке какой-то урод решил полапать. Закричала на весь вагон, но тоже никто особо не дернулся на помощь, хотя тот урод отстал. Вот из-за таких случаев (когда всем пофиг. А их было слишком дофига, хоть и большинство не про домогательства) у меня теперь ярость берсерка, если кого-то обижают. А если меня, то тем более) и напоследок - success-story. 3 - уже на 2 курсе в давке в метро чувствую, что кто-то пытается рукой мне между ног залезть (была в джинсах). Красный туман перед глазами, хватаю первое попавшееся - ключи, и, пока в давке он не может отойти, держу его за ворот, а длиннющий ключ прям у глаза. И проникновенно рассказываю, что целостность его зрения зависит от искусства машиниста и того, как сам он быстро уберёт руки (в ""здравом уме"" я б забоялась так делать, честно, это всё слепая ярость). Ну и что ты думаешь? Урод и те, кто стоял рядом и всё слышали, свалили с криками ""психическая"". Ну и имхо, всё будет плохо (и не только в этой части), пока люди как страусы себя ведут: я ничего не видел, не слышал, это твои проблемы, что такого, сама виновата.|Аж передернуло. Увы, тоже сталкивалась. Мозг тоже потер многое, как выше написали, из чувства самосохранения. Но помню лет в 10 на пляже мужика на мостике через реку Анапка, с яйцами, высунутыми из плавок. Стоял и смотрел на детей. Мы убежали, было очень мерзко и страшно. Домогательства всякие потом уже в более взрослом (скорее подростковом) возрасте от незнакомцев - дофига. Причем я даже юбки не носила, всегда в стиле «пацанка» была. Всегда это мерзко было и страшно. За жопу хватали в давке много раз, но это так.. жопа почему то не так страшно😂 а вот эксгибиционисты конечно люди-говно, жаль что реакция у нас не «пнуть по яйцам», а скорее скрыться|Дело было в Грузии, но, полагаю, это не особенно важно. Мне уже было 20+, ехала я в автобусе, внутри была толпа, и вот я почувствовала, как стоящий сзади мужик положил ладонь мне под колено и принялся протискиваться вверх под юбку. Отскочить было некуда, и я возмущённо сказала что-то вроде ""мужчина, вы охренели?"", на что он, нисколько не смущаясь и не прекращая своего занятия, ответил: ""я скоро выхожу"". Что в переводе означало: ""потерпи ещё, пока я тебя полапаю, уже немного осталось"".",60

Throughout my life I have had a series of sexual fantasies. Most I learned about through watching porn

My ex-husband (married for 28 years) wasn’t very sexually confident - so although we watched a little porn together - he wasn’t a fax of sexual exploration

So sex consisted of mostly in the bedroom and mostly in the morning - two times a week.  He felt this was sufficient - I was sexually frustrated for at least two decades

So - when I left - I swore - “no more”. No more living my life by someone’s standards - no more having unfulfilled fantasies - no more “sexually average”

So that’s how I met Chris - a one-night stand who immediately challenged and accepted my sexual fantasies - no matter how “perverse” my ex told me they were

So now we sexually explore both our fantasies - together and with others (sometimes lots of others 😘) We no longer have “fantasies” that we dream about - we have fantasies to set goals - sexual experiences to have and to share

It’s time to question your limiting beliefs about sex - increase your sexual confident and break the chains of “sexual boredom”. Time to get your sexy back !!! #thequeenvexperience #getyoursexyback #fuckordinary",everydaysexism,"|#womencharacter

802,802,"TL;DR I enjoyed this book. 
I’ve just finished reading #EverydaySexism by Laura Bates. It was a real eye-opener! I found the chapter on women in politics particularly interesting: “Around the world, women are enormously underrepresented in politics... in February 2013, just 20% of parliamentary seats in the world were held by women”. With women being largely outnumbered while ideas are being discussed, it comes with the consequence that policy decisions often disproportionately disadvantage women. For example, women make up two thirds of public-sector workers so budget cuts in this area result in an larger increase in unemployment for women than for men. And, since the majority of primary careers of children, the disabled and the elderly are women, “around three quarters of all cuts to benefits come out of women’s pockets”. Previously I didn’t pay much attention to politics. But I am now pledging to pay attention and to support the women in government who are fighting to ensure that the impacts on women are taken into consideration! Hopefully one day we will have a government with a #diversity which is representative of our population as a whole and people of colour, LGBTQ people and disabled people are also represented!

to see this incredible painting by Artemisia Gentileschi, 'Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria', 1615–17, recently restored and acquired by @nationalgallery 
The labelling is bullshit though 😡 Apparently the work ‘recalls the style of her father’ whom she trained under and the ‘lighting and crop owe much to Caravaggio’ 
Obviously all artists are influenced by their teachers and peers but upon checking EVERY other single label in the room, none of the other works, all by men of course, cite anything other than a description of the work. So before you go slapping yourselves on the back @nationalgallery for this acquisition or the major exhibition you’re planning on her in 2020, maybe give it a little more thought. She had enough to deal with in the 17th century, we should be able to give her the respect and credit she deserves in the 21st century.

Boy of about 8 playing opposite my girl. He’s piling on sand to create a hill to stick a house on. One of the volunteers says to watch out scooping too much sand up from around the hill as the flood is coming m. He carries on scooping and chucking more sand up there energetically.

His mum says as she watches him: “well, I’m raising a boy! Ha!” It struck me that such an innocent comment was heard by about 5 other children of both genders. What’s the message? Boys don’t follow rules? Boys are unstoppable? Boys build big? The inference being that girls don’t do those things?

Whatever it was it just made me think, why did she feel compelled to mention gender. Was that particular bit of playful behaviour anything to do with his gender? 
Unnecessary reinforcement of stereotyping that she probably didn’t even register. In my view at least.

Don’t do it because what happened to me is that I went from fairly sober to paralytic in under 10 minutes.
Dont’ do it because I stumbled and fell round New York at midnight, an unco-ordinated mess as my body stopped functioning.
Don’t do it because I lost my memory and couldn’t find the subway station I use every day, although it was 100 yards away.
Don’t do it because when I finally managed to get on a train, I screamed at a total stranger for nothing, because your drug had turned me insane.
Don’t do it because as I weaved my way to get home, you left me vulnerable to attack.
Don’t do it because when I got home, I spent the next two days alternating between vomiting and lying broken on the bathroom floor.
Don’t do it because, three days later, I still feel like I’ve been stabbed in the kidneys.

GHB can very easily kill - did you want to murder someone on Tuesday night? I don’t know why you’d do this to a stranger, a human being with thoughts and feelings of their own.

At 16 years old she was sex trafficked by a man who consistently beat, threatened, and raped her. She was forced to sell her body for this man. She was forced to give her money and freedom to this man. At 16 years old she was forced to have sex with a 43 year old man whom she felt threatened by and killed. Anything past that reasoning doesn’t matter. She was 16. She was trafficked and being raped. Her sentence did not account for either of those factors.

842,842,"Дорогие товарищи,присядем за гармонию.Сказ сий поведали мне в комментариях, считаю своим долгом разобрать всё по пунктам и лишний раз продемонстрировать, зачем нужно нам страшное слово на букву Ф, которое если произнесено вслух, активизирует всякого рода личностей,чьи горящие зады спешат заставить своих владельцев убеждать оппонентку в том,что всё хорошо и вообще всё по природе.
⠀
Приступим. 1. Женщины (желательно все) созданы для того, чтобы ублажать его взгляд.Свободные в своем самовыражении женщины, которые перестают ориентироваться на хотелки и предпочтения мужчин во внешнем виде, становятся неликвидом и их тут же маркируют ""неженственная"", что, естественно, должно устыдить непокорную, но если мы вспомним, что понятие ""женственность""-это манипуляция и к ""красоте"" не имеет никакого отношения...
⠀
Мы разные, говорит он нам. И это не плохо, просто... Просто должно быть так, как мне хочется. А мне хочется, чтобы женщины сидели и не отсвечивали(да, я тут домысливаю, но реально же понятно, о чем он)
⠀
2.Сложная тема домашнего насилия. Тут все по классике: бьет – самавиновата, самавыбирала. Святая убежденность во всемогуществе силовых органов, которые плохого дядьку заберут. Человек сидит в бункере и не в курсе о ставшем крылатом выражении ""Убьют-тогда и звоните"".Ну и плюсом давайте вспомним прекрасный закон о декриминализации благодаря которому можно лупить,а иногда-и очень сильно бить, но только раз в год без последствий.А так, полупцевать-со спокойной душой. По сути, закон защищает агрессора,а не жертву. Листаем➡️
⠀
3.Перекладывание вины с насильника на жертву. Ведь настоящая девушка всегда может сказать твердо:""Нет"" и мужчина отстанет.
⠀
В каком мире живёт этот человек, который не слышал ни про сталкеров(видимо девушкам нравилось, что их преследуют,а не то иначе они сказали бы ""нет"" строже),ни об изнасилованиях женщин в бурках, весь вид которых кричит о строгости,ни о классическом ""женское нет-это да"", из-за которого отказы со стороны женщин игнорируются

I have been quite pissed off when people talk about 'baby brain'. It's a term I find infantilising. Linguistic every day sexism. How about chronic lack of sleep and your body dealing with something akin to running a 15k for months on end?

It's not quite as snappy though is it.

I have to admit though with 6 weeks to go, or maybe less, I am not tip top Kirsty consistently enough for my liking. My concentration is shot. My decision making ability is deteriorating. And multi-tasking can really go and do one.

845,845,"What do you recommend people read this summer?

As a twist on #tenonmytbr, I put together this stack of 5 fiction + 5 nonfiction picks that I think are great for summer. They are best enjoyed in a park/on a beach/near a pool 🌞

#HowToBeRight by James O'Brien is a short + quick read about the polarisation of politics. Using example conversations from his (very good) radio show, he demonstrates how to ask the right questions but also shows how big a role the media play in determining people's views.

#EverydaySexism by #LauraBates is essential reading for everyone. That's it, that's the sell.

#Educated by Tara Westover, the memoir you've probably seen everywhere by now, but for good reason! Beautifully + candidly written, this book will consume you.

#DontSleepThereAreSnakes by Daniel Everett aka my absolute fave nonfic book. A linguist goes on a mission to a small tribe in the Amazon, + the more he learns about their life + language, the more complex his relationship with his mission becomes. Fascinating from a linguistic perspective + a great memoir!

#HalfofaYellowSun by #ChimamandaNgoziAdichie, a gut-wrenching read about the Biafran War + its effects on everyone.

#Sapiens by #YuvalNoahHarari - everyone needs a doorstop book for summer + a history of humanity is a good one to go with. Provocative + engaging.

#Homegoing by #YaaGyasi aka the novel unfairly scorned by all literary prizes. An epic family saga executed perfectly in 300 pages.

#StayWithMe by #AyobamiAdebayo is another emotional read, but this time about one woman's desire to be a mother. I sobbed.

#NormalPeople by #SallyRooney. Do I need to tell you to read this? Probably not, but just in case you need to hear it: these characters will stay with you for a long time + Rooney can put into such simple words such conplex feelings you'll be left reeling.

#Circe by #MadelineMiller, because who doesn't want to imagine themselves as a witch on their own Greek island?",everydaysexism,"|#books #bookstagram #bookstack #reading|Stay with me is wonderful, and so sad; I also read Normal People recently and appreciated Sally Rooney’s writing.

850,850,"To inspire and empower future generations to grow up to be anything they want to be, free from limiting stereotypes around gender and other aspects of identity, we need to do two things.

First, we need to stop children from forming the self-limiting beliefs that dictate later life choices, and continually try to ensure that traditional stereotypes aren’t formed.

Next, we need to give children easy access to relatable role models that counteract those traditional stereotypes – for example, women in STEM and men in caring professions (and that’s just the tip of the iceberg). If children can see it, they’ll believe they can be it.

Those were the words that clung to my brain as I fired up my @dewalttough table saw for the first time. The image of squirting blood and a lifeless phalange burst to life before my eyes, then disappeared with a shake of my head.⁠

Dramatic? Maybe. But these are the images conjured when receiving well meaning, albeit patronizing, advice. ""Those are sharp"" DUH. 🤦🏽‍♀️ ⁠

I took woodworking in college and felt so badass.|Right?! EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to Home Depot I have to pull a Matrix move to dodge men in every aisle who insist on trying to educate me on paint types, materials, etc as though I haven’t moved 638374 times or remodeled buildings on my own before.

My favorite encounters are when I’m comparing things in an isle, and someone(🙄) standing next to me who DOESN’T work there asks if I need help.. and I explain what I’m doing and they sheepishly respond with an “oh, um, yeah sounds like you know what you’re doing”.|😂 but actually plz don’t cut your digits off.

860,860,"Are witches a ‘goodie’ or a ‘baddie’ in your house?
➕
Part 2 of feminist chats with my kid 😂 My little asked me this the other day -“why are witches bad?” I agree with them. Why ARE witches always the scary baddie? Wart on the nose, eating very odd concoctions of vermin and herbs, poking kids with long nails, trapping them in cages, having delusions and chatting to mirrors...
➕
Here’s a few reason why witches are ALSO a goodie in my house (and ALWAYS a goodie when I’m playing the game 😂)
1: Because witches are awesome
2: Because goodie female characters don’t get much of a look in beyond ‘Princess’ 🙄
3: Because witches are awesome
4: Because it’s a great opportunity to show little people that powers can be used for bad or good 
5: Because witches are awesome (you get the idea right?)
6: Because many women were murdered, violated, ostracised, assaulted, financially and socially ruined through witchcraft accusations. Feels kinda dark to reinforce that negative perception which facilitated this to happen through games we play with kids...
7: Because knowing about herbs, medicine, midwifery, putting a middle finger up to social norms, farting at the patriarchy,  embracing the sisterhood, and caring for animals are all things I want my little people to emulate
8: Because being able to cast spells and fly on broomsticks is bloody awesome!
9: Just because a woman is powerful, a bit scary and uncontrollable, that does not make her ‘bad’
10: Because there are many people who identify with “witch” as a religion (Wicca, Druid, Pagan etc) and we shouldn’t portray this group through stereotypes and negative images
11: and finally, because witches are AWESOME!
➕
So scrap the witch stereotypes. Who’s your favourite witch? I’m particularly enamoured with Angelina Jolie’s Maleficent 😍🔮🧹🌿

863,863,"Что не так с рекламой, шаурмой и кляпом во рту.
⠀
Долго думала как бы по-правильному написать этот пост. Про объективацию, сексизм и хайпующих на больном рекламщиков.
⠀
Вышло бы слишком много текста и большинство бы не поняло.
⠀
Поэтому напишу про себя и, почему именно, я считаю что такой «рекламе» (см. в карусели) не место нигде. И почему такая реклама — не смешно. И почему на такое нельзя закрывать глаза.
⠀
Как мне показалось из ответов в сториз, почти никто не посчитал эту рекламу оскорбительной, непристойной и демонстрирующей насилие над женщиной.
⠀
«Настя, да брось! Какое насилие??? Это же реклама, смешная! Шаурмой рот заткнули ахахах 😂»
«Настя, я в таких рекламах уже ничего не вижу, и вообще их не замечаю, это норма, не стоит так бурно реагировать!»
«Какой-нибудь остроумный в своей двусмысленности комментарий»
«Why not?!» - как написано на бутылке зинфанделя, который сейчас помогает мне писать этот пост.
⠀
Уважаемые мои соседи по планете!
Такая реклама как раз и норма, потому что никто не замечает и относится к этому спокойно. Так быть не должно. Эти «картинки», как и любые другие, влияют на общество и формируют мировосприятие каждого из нас. Так же они формируют восприятие одного пола другим. «Всем женщинам нравится секс», «нет=да», «каждой женщине нужна сильная мужская рука», «бьет значит любит», «баба моя опять меня пилит, вот бы ей кляп в рот затолкать», «а ещё лучше на привязь посадить», «вон, в рекламе же показывают».
⠀
Я бы не хотела чтобы меня воспринимали как человека которому можно заткнуть рот и это норма. А вы?

Зато на предложение этикетки с мужиком с бутылкой в заду - сразу ""фу-фу-фу, ты перегибаешь"" и ""ты не понимаешь, реклама ж должна привлекать"".|Блин, с одной стороны я бы глядя на эту рекламу подумала о хорошем сексе, но с другой стороны: наши мужчины все под другим углом на это смотрят.|Мне не понравилась реклама даже внешне. Она отталкивает. Даже потому, что там есть «намек» на насилие, и трусы из лаваша - это пошло (ну для меня это точно не современное искусство. Далеко им. Грань потеряна). Человек, который придумал, потом другой одобрил, просто как животные на каком- о там отклике, решили - прикольно!... но, мы ж , хочется верить, живем в разумном обществе, и за каждым действием должен быть смысл, не нарушающий чьи-либо права.

869,869,"Women’s sexual liberation should not be about fending off men’s sexuality, but rather, about women embracing their own. It’s no secret that we need to reset the culture of sexual politics. Women should not be intimidated or coerced into sex. Women should be free to sleep with people because they WANT to, not because they owe them anything, or have been coerced into it, or because they were forced. I can be pro sex and anti rape. The obvious (or should be obvious) difference is explicit consent. Changing rape culture is not about sheltering women and hiding them away from men. It is about changing the culture that allows, or even encourages, rampant sexual assault. Just because a woman is sexually active does not mean she is for the taking. It means she is in control of her own body; she chooses who she fucks. Sex is about both individuals actively choosing to engage in sex, simple as that.

875,875,"As we gear up to launch something new and (hopefully) exciting, it's probably time for a little intro. Here's a bit about me, and I'd love to hear about you - please comment below!

So, yes, hello! I'm Claire: a 30-something mother of one, currently on maternity leave from a career in advertising. I love writing, baking and hiking; I've got the biggest sweet tooth, and also a serious case of wanderlust (40 odd countries and counting). I live in London with my husband, our daughter and our very friendly (but very stupid) cat. And I've been passionate about gender equality for, well, pretty much as long as I can remember. 
I’ve always had the urge to do something more – a feeling that I too have a bigger role to play in the pursuit of equality. I’ve explored a lot of different ways in: from Women’s Marches to Lean In groups, from running workshops in schools to podcasts on women’s leadership, and from 50:50 Parliament events to Women of the World conference workshops. Oh, and of course a steady stream of heartfelt and passionate chats with friends, co-workers and family over tea (…and usually Pret gingerbread men, my weakness in life). These have all been brilliant (especially the gingerbread men), and I’ve met some amazing people along the way who are doing truly incredible things. I’ve been inspired, and awed, and frustrated, and excited. But, for all of this, I still can’t help feeling that I haven’t quite found *it*. When I became pregnant for the first time, I had a bit of a revelation. Many years ago, in an excited conversation with a friend and after perhaps slightly too much wine, we ambitiously debated what we thought the answer was to gender inequality. Naive grand visionary as I was back then, the broad answer I landed on I believe still stands: that if we really want to affect change, we have to start at birth, before gender preconceptions are set.

If we want our children to succeed in a variety of careers, we have to enable them from a very early age to believe that they can be anything, igniting their ambition and redefining what careers are open to them and what leadership means. I’m on a mission to do that! 💪",everydaysexism,|#rolemodels #womensupportingwomen #quotestoliveby #wordstoliveby #inspirationalquotes #genderequality #genderstereotypes #nomoregenderstereotypes #stronggirls #everydaysexism #raisingthefuture #pbloggers #motherhoodinspired #feministmum #raisingfeminists #raisingdaughters #beyondpinkandblue #equalityforall #intersectionalfeminism #bethechange #lettoysbetoys #letkidsbekids #smashthepatriarchy #feministblogger #gendernorms #genderequity #parentingbloggers #mummybloggers #ukmumblog #raisingequals|Lovely to hear more about you!

876,876,"Dear boys (yes, you are boys, you are so very far from being men), it’s not just what you did that fucked me off, it’s who you did it to. I saw you. And you know you did it. Because, as the meme goes, there’s nobody who protests harder than a guy accused of something he very definitely did. And when you tried to bully - yes, you definitely did that too - a woman who is older and wiser than you, and you challenged her to seek out a member of authority to back her up, you thought she wouldn’t. So yes, I did it. And I felt shit about it, because not only was it unnecessary, but if it had been literally anyone else in the gym (for I was the only woman there at the time) who challenged you, you wouldn’t have dared to bite back. Not a chance. So not only did you breach some etiquette, but you were also utterly sexist about it. And this, dear world, is the kind of shameful behaviour that puts people off. This is a barrier to entry for those who are even a little bit scared, never mind the ones who are downright intimidated. I am a woman of extraordinary privilege: born and raised in a first world country to a middle class family; Caucasian; well-educated; never unemployed; generally healthy and, when not, able to readily access healthcare which is free at the point of use... and yet there’s this fuckery. Something no man will ever, ever understand. It’s almost intangible. But this shit goes down almost daily. And, in fact, since I’ve got older and fitter, it’s got worse. The unsolicited passing looks when I’m innocently going about my business; the smiles and comments; the fucking behaviour. It’s desperately irritating. And I’m one of the tough ones, I’m the one who’ll call it out and let you know that it’s not ok. This must happen thousands of times per minute, is it any wonder it persists when it goes so unchecked? And this is the face I pull, when I have to confront it yet again. Because I’m tired.

Every time I and a friend of mine come across a bad driver and she turns out to be a woman, they do not wait to point it out to me that women are bad drivers. The same “evidence”, however, is not pointed out when the driver is a man. May be just a comment about how he is a bad driver, but not a sweeping comment about the entire male gender! What is this? This is confirmation bias. Can you give us some more examples?

888,888,"Casual poser. 
A little bit of an essay today... with the intention of highlighting why harassment campaigns are so necessary.

Last few days has been a bit of a trip with Catcalls account and a heightened gaggle of insane people out in full force. Had a day or two of slightly losing my shit. Alongside rape and ""I can ruin your life"" threats, my looks have been attacked, my size and weight have been torn apart and I've had my old address sent to me alongside a rape threat. 
Next to those, an overwhelming amount of belligerent douchebags requiring I justify every statement or choice of engagement. 
More hearteningly, were over a thousand messages of support from amazing people with stories about what the account means to them, which made my heart super happy. 
It's amazing how our self-worth can be challenged by complete strangers and also completely uplifted. The lesson learned from all of this however, is that my self-worth isn't attached to a bunch of awful people from the internet, but in the work that I'm doing and the incredible community that has been built around it. 
Every single one of the 342 messages of abuse I received in the course of 2 days are from someone's child, parent, sibling, co-worker, friend... maybe even you. When you  dismiss the campaign you're dismissing that every single day womxn across the world are faced with harassment in all its forms - both out in the real world and online. We need to be shining a light on this kind of behaviour, and calling it out, educating our young and old alike that it is unacceptable. There need to be real life consequences that create a deterrent. And there needs to be a change in the conditions that allow this sort of behaviour to breed. 
And if you haven't already sign the damn petition in my bio.

And you know what’s worse? They’re a UK registered company, and the regulation around them is next to none. MindGeek is one of the most powerful tech conglomerates in the world and not only do they have NOTHING in place to prevent this from happening, they encourage it - genres called “revenge porn” and “leaked sex tapes” are front and centre. They profit massively from these videos. ICloud hackers steal nudes and intimate videos from our phones and use it as content. Well, we say no fucking more.

.
You missed your kid’s school play because you couldn’t take off a few hours in the middle of the day = bad mom.
.
You can’t go out with your colleagues for happy hour after work because there’s no one to watch your kids = bad team player.
.
Your lover says you’re distant, but really it’s that you have nothing to talk about because prepping for trial is consuming your life and he’s not an attorney and doesn’t understand = bad lover.
.
You have to stay home from the office because your child is sick = bad lawyer.
.
You forget to wish your friend happy birthday because you’re laser-focused on prepping for a hearing = bad friend.
.
You show up to court in hose with a huge run because you forgot to shave your legs the night before, your pant suit is at the dry cleaners, and it’s the only pair you had = bad woman.

And on and on. Bc the fact remains: woman in the law face challenges that men don’t, and while we’re all doing the best we can, inevitably, somewhere we’re going to fall short, bc while we all may be Wonder Woman, we’re not perfect.
.
So over at the Lady Lawyers’ League, we want to acknowledge and 👏🏼 the good things we did during week in a new series: Fantastic Feat Friday. 🙌🏼
.
It’s simple: every Friday we’ll post & you lovely ladies can comment with something you did during the week that you’re proud of. Anything goes—it can be something as small as getting depositions scheduled or packing a healthy lunch for work on Tuesday, or as big as getting a guilty verdict or completing a massive merger. Whatever it is, we want to hear it!😃
.
And look, we get it— it’s uncomfortable to brag on ourselves. 😬But it’s necessary. Research by Women of Influence & Thomas Reuters found that women still cling to the assumption that their achievements will speak for themselves at much higher rates than men, and, in fact, self-promotion is the second biggest pitfall for women in business.

906,906,"Why we are feminists
💕
We hate knowing that our opinions are less valued than men’s, and that our emotions are dubbed hormonal or irrational.
❉
We hate being seen as bodies or objects.
🌻
We hate knowing that the respect we have to fight for is given to men as a birthright.
❉
We hate being catcalled for wearing clothes that make us happy (newsflash: we might not be doing it for MALE attention, because it’s not all about you! Sometimes we just enjoy wearing these clothes, and we don’t think we should be harassed by you for doing so!).
✨
We hate being paid less than men.
❉
We hate being disbelieved or mocked if we are raped or sexually assaulted. We hate being told it has something to do with our clothes, or our attitudes, or our status as women. We hate being frightened to report.
🍎
We DON’T hate men, think that we are better than everyone else, think that we should all ditch bras or stop shaving (unless we want to!), think that women should all become boss ladies (unless we want to!), or think that all men are fuckboys.
❉
We want equal rights for all; no matter our race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, class status, pay grade, weight, or fashion style.
🧜‍♀️
Sometimes we scream too loud because we are frustrated. Because we feel oppressed and alienated. Because we have lived under the rule of a patriarchal society for centuries. Because, in a world of opposition, we want a voice, too. Overall, though, we just want equality. We want to be free and understood. We want to be recognized.

Man, I never want to stop hearing this. I was guilty of shaming women in the past for wearing revealing clothes.... and I'm so embarrassed now to realise I did that with zero remorse when I was a teenager. I devalued women based upon how they wanted to present themselves. It's not okay. I've only just realised now how beautiful and courageous it is for women to be proud of their bodies and wear that outfit despite the potential judgement and shaming of others. It's something I'm still working on, because for so long I saw revealing women's clothing as a sexual thing. I realise now that I was part of the problem in a big way. I'm so so sorry for objectifying you, and making you feel less than, simply for wearing a specific style of clothing.|I love this, so accurate and truthful...so many people thing that feminism is about the fall of men and the rise of women, when it’s not, it’s about gaining equality among all people regardless of gender, race, sexuality, etc. because we’re all human beings and deserve equal rights, it’s about ending gender stereotypes and snuffing our things such as rape and sexual assault by encouraging those who have gone through it to speak up and educate everyone that it’s never the survivor’s (I prefer to say survivor rather than victim) fault, it’s about these things and so much more, but it’s not about hatred or bigotry, those are the very things we stand against 💕🌈🌹|Women don’t deserve equal rights and equal responsibility cause they don’t know how to juggle both",210

That being said, key to executing a presentation in a way that most effectively communicates your point is to “know your audience”, which if you’re an American career woman, is more than likely to largely be made up of men who avoid the phrase “unconscious gender bias” like the plague.  If this situation sounds familiar, (worry not!) I encourage you to just relax and continue being yourself but learn to speak in an artificially low voice and to change your name to Jeff.  This strategy is effective because it unconsciously creates a more trusting response from this particular audience as it will be more natural for them to trust a deeper voice from a person named Jeff to actually know what they’re talking about than a woman acting normal – even if Jeff has breasts and delivers the presentation in a noticeably unnatural tone of voice. 🧑🏻👠💼📈👏🏻👨🏼‍🦳

911,911,"New logo because... we’re nearly ready to unveil our plans! But for now, let us tell you a bit more about what we’re here for and why: 
Our mission is to inspire and empower future generations to grow up to be anything they want to be, free from limiting stereotypes around gender and other aspects of identity.

Why? Well:

Not only will we not see equal parenting responsibilities, pay, opportunities and leadership representation in our lifetimes, but we’re on track not to see it in our children’s lifetimes either. We’re not willing to wait that long!

While initiatives exist to tackle these issues (e.g. shared parental leave and gender pay gap policies), we need to start closer to home – and that means closer to birth. Gender stereotypes start to form in children’s minds by two, and by five, these develop into self-limiting beliefs about what they can or can’t do, or who they should or shouldn’t be. By six, these are set: children believe girls aren’t strong, boys shouldn’t show emotion, and that jobs have genders (‘girl jobs’ and ‘boy jobs’) Children grow up to make choices around careers and identities based on those stereotypes set in early childhood – beliefs that are incredibly hard to dislodge. This means that as important as policies to address adulthood inequality are, the reality is that these do too little, and are likely fifteen years too late. 
So how do we raise a generation of equals? Well, that’s where our plans come in. We have an exciting new initiative that we can’t wait to tell you about! What a tease, eh? More very soon... .

Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men.

913,913,"Feminism for Men

Feminism, in some groups has become somewhat of a dirt word. Some associate it with ‘man hating’ or ‘extreme views’. So what is feminism? ‘The advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.’ [Oxford Dictionary]

Important word up there 👆EQUALITY! Equal. Not one side or the other. Those who are feminists are wanting to balance out the imbalance in society, show through all facets of life, personal and professional. 
It is not a hatred of men. It’s showing the reality women have to live with in essentially a ‘mans world’. Showing these realities is hard to stomach at first, but once you educate yourself on how to be self aware of your actions and current social norms that promote imbalance. You’ll soon find that the way some (unfortunately it’s more the majority) of people talk, act and behave is a detriment to half the population.

There are so many areas to discuss with this topic. Many of which I’d love to hear from both men and women on their thoughts and experiences in life.

Are there areas you’d like to see covered first? •

This happens to me a lot lately and I just don’t get it. For example today I’m wearing this dress. I actually chose it over a short jumpsuit this morning, because I didn’t want to expose my body to men like these. I always feel super uncomfortable wearing shorts and I don’t even by hot pants. And even though I’m wearing this dress the same thing happened again. How is this even a thing? We’re not objects or livestock. Why do we even have to think about the reaction of men while choosing our outfit in the morning? It’s going to be like 38 degrees again today and I’m wearing a dress I’m probably going to melt in, just because I’m scared of their reactions? This is stupid, yet I don’t know what to do. •

925,925,"""Lawyer advises young peers to stick a fork in client's hand if sexually harassed."" That's one piece of advice . . . . In my view, the problem with it isn't just that it sounds silly and could get the victim arrested. ⠀
⠀
It also misses that a lot of sexual harassment does not involve any kind of physical contact or physical threat (or at least doesn't start out that way). ⠀
⠀
It misses that a lot of sexual harassment is targeted at women because they are women and has nothing to do with sexual advances. ⠀
⠀
It misses that a lot of people would never commit violence, even when they experience violence . . . and that they are reasonable, smart people.⠀
⠀
It misses that there are thousands of responses to sexual harassment that shuts it down and creates a safe environment.⠀
⠀
It misses that many people do not carry forks with them to work and a lot of sexual harassment happens away from the dinner table. ⠀
⠀
So, what's your go-to response to harassment? Mine is typically humor. A client I had liked to say she needed a moment and walk away. What do you do when someone is acting inappropriately? ⠀

930,930,"""The Grass Is Greener If You Have A Weiner"".... YUP, I said it. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk! 🔥🙄 This piece was formed out of frustration at the attacks towards women and our rights. It seems everyone is thought to deserve body autonomy except us. The incredibly strict rulings in Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio are about policing women, not protecting fetuses or the women themselves. The world is a very closed off, regulated, and pro-shaming place as a woman. As more men escape repercussions of raping while womens lives remain forever changed, we are proving this is acceptable, that we are second class citizens. We are telling our girls to cover up and stay inside, while allowing our boys to act however they choose because they ""grow up slower."" Take note of every woman who apologizes throughout the day and pay attention to if they are even apologizing for something they need to be sorry for, or if it's simply been engrained in them to not take up too much space, be too loud, or ask too many questions. We've been conditioning the sexes into their roles for lifetimes without even questioning why and what that does to our society. We as artists and ceramicists have it in our own community, and I'm thankful to see us questioning practices and people speaking out for themselves and eachother. We still have an upward battle, but I'm glad we are soldiering on.

933,933,"I took this picture before I left my house yesterday. It was super hot out and I was feeling cute and also stoked that my new workplace doesn't force me to cover up my entire body on 30°+ days. I decided to walk to work since it's so close and it was a sunny beautiful day.
.
I was catcalled five times within a few hours, with varying levels of threateningness. And I was followed by a truck while I was walking. And I was chased by a guy who bolted from his van across the street as I was about to walk into my apartment building and I had to pull the door shut while he tried pulling it to keep it open.
.
I want to throw out all my shorts and wear big hoodies and stay inside. But I need to remember that wearing shorts doesn't make it okay for creeps to follow women into their homes. Pants do not act as perv-repellent. I shouldn't need to sacrifice sunlight for safety by staying indoors.
.
So I'm going to continue to wear weather-appropriate clothing, and keep my dog-spray close. If you can't look at me without saying or doing something pervy, I'll make sure you can't keep looking at me.

940,940,"⚠️⚠️ Puerto Rico has just risen in unity in response to the Boricuan governor , Ricardo Rosselló’s abusive and rude comments through almost 900 pages of conversations leaked by El Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (the Centre of Investigative News reporting). In these conversations, Rosselló is found to have been homophobic, racist, misogynistic and simply arrogant. Through these conversations he verbally attacked victims of recent tragedies like hurricane Maria as well as multiple mainstream Boricuan personalities including Ricky Martin who went on to lead one of the 5 day protests in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
In Bad Bunny and Residente’s words “Si todo el pueblo quiere que te vayas y tú te quedas, entonces estamos en dictadura” (If the entire town wants you to leave and you stay, we’re in a dictatorship).
Importantly, the people have demanded that he leaves and despite many of his associates having resigned, he refuses to leave as part of his intolerance and arrogance. We must point out that by having the people of Puerto Rico take ownership of their own government, we are also taking a major step towards decolonisation and we therefore need their voices to be heard. Spread the word, we stand with Puerto Rico🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷

A lot of people find great joy in the age old typical institutions that have stood the test of time, things like gender roles, marriage, religion, honest work, philosophy, western values, and in a lot of regards they see feminism as either opposed to or actively trying to dismantle and infringe on those things. There’s also a lot of issues people take with some of the tenants of feminism, that being that women are inherently oppressed, or that men are inherently bad and uphold bad systems, or identity politics and all those sorts of things. Now I will say yea, there are still a lot of valuable things to be learned and to be paved by feminism, but a lot of the application as it has been demonstrated goes against a lot of core values that people have.|Feminism doesn’t teach that men are inherently bad and making 2/3 of every dollar of the opposite sex sounds pretty oppressive.Also every culture with the exception of Norway has placed Women into submissive roles to their male counterparts.|Manhood isn’t about “oppressing women” stfu with that self victimization narrative shit you can use manhood for the greater good and be a better person as a man",80

963,963,"Today’s conundrum: dresses. Is there a place for dresses in a gender neutral wardrobe? My daughter wears gender neutral clothes in terms of colours and motifs, but I’m having this dilemma. On the one hand: it’s only our stereotypical ideas about dresses that makes us think they’re “for girls”, and so why shouldn’t our sons wear dresses too? So the answer is that instead of not buying dresses for our daughters, we are instead open to all children wearing them, regardless of gender. On the other hand: it’s easy for me to say that as a mother to a daughter, but how many parents would actually feel comfortable buying dresses for their sons? And because dresses ARE seen as gendered for females, like it or not, the best way to go gender neutral is not to clothe her in dresses at all but instead in, say, babygros and shorts and t-shirts. What’s your take? .

So we do have a few (very practical / not restricting and playground friendly dresses) as long as she can climb, scoot and write her bike in then I am ok with it. 🤷🏼‍♀️|And for colour... her favourite is yellow (phew!) but I believe in letting her pick her colours. Colours are so much more than gender specific. So we have a few pink items but we have all sorts of colours! I also see the boys in our hood always fighting about her pink scooter. All the kids have decided it’s the best one 👏😂
So as long as it’s not perceived in this stereotypical way I am ok with it. And also there are gifts...🤷🏼‍♀️ how do you handle it?
Do you have a strict no pink policy?|Oh and: she still is being called a boy every day even though her sneakers are pink !? But she wears a lightblue helmet and is fearless on her bike. So it shows that people just assume someone sporty and fearless has to be a boy 🙄|Oh and: she still is being called a boy every day even though her sneakers are pink !? But she wears a lightblue helmet and is fearless on her bike. So it shows that people just assume someone sporty and fearless has to be a boy 🙄|Really interesting one. My son who is 3 does not have any dresses becuase I have not brought any for him. He wears all colours, his favourite is pink, and has no concept of gender. If he wishes to wear dresses I wouldn't stop him and would nurture it, but I myself haven't yet purchased one for him yet",29

967,967,"Lunch Girl 🥪 Throughout our careers so far we’ve wondered: am I just imagining that the lunch ordering question is directed at me? Do they all think I should be ordering the lunch, or is it me that thinks I should be the lunch girl, that I deserve to be, or maybe it’s that I’m just comfortable in that role? One of the most insidious parts of subtle office sexism for us is the way it can cast internal doubt on every moment. Was that compliment really about my work, or was it about my tight pencil skirt? Am I on this panel because they love my ideas, or because they needed a woman? What would I feel like in the office if I could just order lunch for everyone, sometimes, without reading into it?⠀

972,972,"Ich habe euch am Anfang dieser Woche gefragt, ob ihr Erfahrungen mit Catcalling (sprachlicher sexueller Belästigung in der Öffentlichkeit) gemacht habt und wie ihr damit umgeht.
Fast jede von euch hat schon mal Catcalls erlebt und die Mehrheit erlebet diese Form der Belästigung als belastend. Ein Grund dafür könnte sein, dass viele nicht wissen, wie sie damit umgehen sollen. Viele ignorieren die Zurufe, das Hinterherpfeifen und die Bemerkungen, auch weil sie Angst vor einer gewalttätigen Reaktion haben. Gleichzeitig sorgt das Nichtstun aber dafür, dass ihr euch noch lange über die Situation ärgert.
Diejenigen von euch, die die Belästigung nicht schweigend hinnehmen wollen, zeigen den Catcallern oft den Mittelfinger oder pöbeln sie an. Witzig fand ich die Lösung, übertrieben positiv zu reagieren und das Gegenüber damit zu verwirren - und sehr souverän erschien es mir, den Catcallern ernst ins Gesicht zu schauen und ""Das war unangemessen"" zu sagen. 
Außerdem wollte ich wissen, was euch nach Catcalls hilft. Besonders häufig habt ihr mir geschrieben, dass ihr mit Freund*innen über das Erlebte sprecht, um Trost und Verständnis zu erfahren. Allerdings hat eine Person zu bedenken gegeben, dass sie ihre Verbündeten damit auch daran erinnert, dass wir in einem Patriarchat leben – und dass sie das eigentlich gerne vermeiden würde. Wenn es euch auch so geht: Eine Nutzerin erzählt anderen Männern von diesen Übergriffen. Hier können sich männliche Feministen nützlich machen und in ihren Freundeskreisen gegen Catcalling vorgehen. 
Andere Nutzer*innen wünschen sich Hilfe direkt in der Situation, also Zivilcourage von Fremden oder eine einfache Möglichkeit, diese Form der Belästigung bei der Polizei anzuzeigen und damit ernstgenommen zu werden. Eine Auswahl eurer Antworten findet ihr in der heutigen Story und im Highlight „Catcalling“. Ihr habt Ergänzungen? Dann schreibt sie in die Kommentare! ~ Sabrina",everydaysexism,"|Bildbeschreibung: Auf dem Foto im Hintergrund sind zwei Personen zu sehen, die als Mann und Frau gelesen werden können. Der Mann ruft der Frau etwas hinterher, sie wirkt genervt. Über dem Bild liegt ein halbtransparentes Quadrat in weiß.

977,977,"Period. End of Sentence. Is a documentary about living in rural India where stigma surrounding women’s periods still exists.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
@periodendofsentence is available on @netflix worldwide. It’s a short documentary directed by @raykazehtabchi who travelled to India to film and interview local rural women.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It’s an incredible story of stigma, oppression, resilience, and perseverance. Period. follows a group of women who are ashamed of their menstrual cycle, many even leaving school because they don’t have adequate sanitary products.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

989,989,"If you can’t see it, you can’t be it. That’s not new, but neither sadly is the recent finding that astronaut is still way down the list of career aspirations for young girls at around 10%, despite the work being done to encourage more women in STEM (study by LEGO). So how can we encourage all children to believe they can be an astronaut, should they want to be? Well, if we want change, we need to take responsibility to effect it ourselves. Another recent study by toy brand Mattel showed that 80% of parents lacked knowledge of STEM careers for their children to aspire to, and this was even more the case when it came to parents’ knowledge of any female STEM role models. So, as parents and caregivers, let’s build our knowledge of the possible careers for our children, regardless of gender, and actively help raise awareness of the role models out there in careers that defy the “traditional” gender norms.

998,998,"Everyday sexism.

Not a post I thought I'd be making today, but then two truck drivers hooted at me when I was running, making obscene gestures out of their windows. That happens to me a lot.

So why not head this post with one of those sexist, narcissistic running selfies that are so popular on insta? 
It's 2019. We - at least we lucky ones in so-called civilised first world countries - have achieved gender equality. On paper at least.

How is it still acceptable for men at an office to deny a female coworker's right to be angry by dismissing her as ""probably on her period""? How is it acceptable for a male coworker to be branded as ""probably gay"" because he is still a bachelor at 50? So what if he is? Why do we still need to reduce people to their genitals to be comfortable with their identity? 
How can the car salesman sell me a car that I have picked, tested and paid for with my own money that I earned in my own job and still treat my husband like he just generously gifted his little wifey a car?

How come my neighbour comes over when I cut the hedge to ask my why ""the master"" (!) isn't doing it?

How come when i open my car's bonnet to check the oil, I'm still immediately surrounded by men trying to mansplain to me what I need to do?

How come the mechanic can tell me to let my husband check then engine when it acts up (fun fact: he doesn't even know how to open the bonnet)? I'm not an angry person, and I don't usually stand on soap boxes. All these incidents pass, and I brush them off as they happen. But something is still very wrong in this society. And it makes me angry to see people being reduced to what they carry between their legs.

My neighbour was just trying to be nice. My coworkers aren't homophobic. The truckers were appreciative of my butt (I assume). The salesman thought he was just doing his job. The guys offering to check my oil wanted to help. And yet, all of them rankled.

What makes an action sexist? The intention, or the reception? 
#everydaysexism",everydaysexism,"|What's sad is the only part of your incidents that shocked me was your boss - because I'd expect better from a business environment.

The way it leaves you feeling...whether it be angry, embarrassed, belittled etc. Glad you harnessed that feeling and shared it!👍|I think these actions are sexists tout court. The other day the meter man had the audacity to advice me to ask my husband for a new dress because we saved substantially on our electricity bill. And yet he left the house alive😇
And yes you could say he was just making conversation and trying to be nice. But I don't know what's worse intentional sexism or these ingrained prejudices. And if one other person on the phone asks me to speak with the man of the house I'm going to scream😡 I live alone BTW😅|Excellent and timely post. “Well meaning sexism” abounds. The fact that we all have these stories and all realize something is wrong is SO important! And it’s so important to talk about sexism at home - with the family.

Ugh.|Yep, yep, yep. My personal fave was the time I was almost done changing a tire and three ""helpers""pulled over and INSISTED on finishing the job. Because obviously I couldn't handle it, even though getting the damn lug nuts off is really the hardest part. I was very glad that they were all radiating helpfulness (condescending as it may have been) rather than any sort of predatory vibes, because I was alone on a back country road, and even at that point in my life wouldn't have been able to fight off three men. But that doesn't mean that the fear didn't flicker in my mind at first. And going in to tell the mechanics what is wrong with my car is one of my least favorite things to do. Soooo much ""little miss"" attitude. Grrrr.|Yessss 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Get it.",35

1032,1032,"""Ey, geiler Arsch, Süße, komm mal rüber"", dröhnt der angetrunkene Typ auf der anderen Straßenseite und streckt die Hand in meine Richtung aus. Ich verdrehe die Augen, gehe weiter und mache die Musik in meinen Ohrstöpfeln lauter. Sein Gelächter höre ich trotzdem.
.
Kennt ihr den Begriff ""Catcalling""? Der Begriff für den es keine gute deutsche Übersetzung gibt, beschreibt anstößige Sprüche, hinterherpfeifen oder ähnliche sexuell aufgeladene Handlungen. Das hat nichts mit flirten zu tun, sondern ist (sexuelle) Belästigung. .
Das ist kein Einzelfall, sondern passiert ständig. Aber wenn ich mich darüber beschwere, bekomme ich - besonders von cis Männern - öfter zu hören, ich würde mich anstellen: ""Hör halt nicht hin"", heißt es dann oder: ""Das ist doch ein Kompliment!""
.
Aber natürlich ist es kein Kompliment. Ein Kompliment zeichnet sich durch Wertschätzung und Interesse an der anderen Person aus - und beides fehlt bei Catcalling. Bemerkungen über meinen Körper oder Anzüglichkeiten sind stattdessen Machtdemonstrationen von Typen, die glauben, sie hätten ein Recht auf unsere Aufmerksamkeit, auf unser Unbehagen - und vielleicht sogar auf unsere Angst. .
Obwohl Belästigung grundsätzlich Schuld der Täter ist, glauben viele Betroffene, sie seien mitschuld, wenn ihnen sowas passiert. Als müssten sich nur richtig verhalten, dann würde Catcalling nicht mehr passieren. Das stimmt nicht. .
Was macht ihr denn, wenn euch jemand hinterherpfeift? Ich ignoriere es meistens, aber gegen die Wut hilft das nicht. Erzählt mir in den Kommentaren von euren Erfahrungen! ~ Sabrina

What do you think this means? ⠀
(a) There's more sexual harassment happening now.⠀
(b) More women are being honest in reporting their experiences.⠀
(c) More women understand what sexual harassment is and are able to report more accurately.⠀

I'm always curious whether we should take higher reporting rates as a good thing or a bad thing. What do you think?⠀

(See @BeingDressCoded post on 7/9/19.) But in an interview with  @goodmorningamerica, Dr. Rowe said that the apology wasn't enough and that “If you’re going to have a dress code, it should be applied equally to every person, to every shape, to every race."" She told the @nytimes, “Had they seen that same issue in a woman who was not a woman of color, they would not have felt empowered to take me off the plane. In pop culture, especially black women with a body like mine, they’re often portrayed as video vixens. So I’ve had to deal with those stereotypes my whole life.” *** Thank you to @tisharowemd for being a role model in speaking up against the airline & all discriminatory acts of dress-coding. *** Have you been #dresscoded (policed, judged, shamed over your clothing) or experienced #slutshaming because of your appearance?

1054,1054,"So in the light of a previous post (scroll to final pic on this post) taken from an extremely good Twitter post by @paula_espener against @clintonsretail I was so astonished by comments made on social media that I just had to create a piece of artwork around it. Everyday sexism is ignored by women and men alike, brushed off as some harmless piece of lint. It is in fact a stark reality that keeps alive gender stereotypes, pushes girls and boys into roles and perpetuates inequality. It seems that being comfortable is ok for a lot of people. My guess is upsetting the status quo in that comfortable but unequal world is the only way. Prescribed gender stereotypes keep men and women from gender equality. Let's liberate both men and women. Simple.

Resultatet endte på at 91% syntes skolekåringer som ""Årets bryster"" er sexistisk og unødvendig kroppsfokus og objektivisering av kvinnekroppen i skolen. Det var 6 gutter som svarte NEI til at dette er sexistisk, og 2 jenter. En av jentene kontaktet meg og opplyste om at hun hadde trykket feil. Det at altså 99% av jentene som deltok i undersøkelsen var enig i at det er sexistisk, og at de som dro ned snittet var GUTTER, understreker hele poenget jeg tok opp i posten om at for gutter er det så normalisert med kvinneundertrykkende holdninger og at gutter syntes sexistiske holdninger mot jenter er ""morsomt"" og greit. Det er det selvsagt IKKE og gutters holdninger til jenter må endres! Hverdagssexisme og sexistisk ""humor"" er en del av et større og svært alvorlig problem; voldtektskulturen og kvinneundertrykkelse.

1061,1061,"Sexism in school plays. Hmmmm.

Last Friday I went to my niece's school play where they performed a modern tribute to Shakespeare - rapping, funny dancing, etc. You get the deal. An early plot was the fact that women weren't allowed to act, so some pretended to be men so they could. Ahh! I thought excitedly. This will be a wonderful demonstration of how boys and girls should be treated equally, demonstrating the ridiculous of historic sexism.

Except it wasn't. Top three things that pissed me off:

1. Essex girl jokes
2. Getting 10 and 11 year olds to sing about how to be a girl with the words...and the miming...""wax your legs and stick out your chest""
3. I hoped this was ironic. Setting me up to have my indignant state punctured. But no, the next scene was about trying to identify who the female actors were and this was achieved by waving a pair of high heels and all the girls getting giggly, chasing after them, and saying how beautiful they were.

For fuck's sake.

A large chunk of the projects that I am working on require spending a lot of time talking to people, mostly across rural India. 7 times out of 10, I get patronised by locals, used to make me angry but now it's just amusing. Field reporting has given me insights and patience in ways only experience can and also taught me a valuable lesson of not taking myself and my opinions too seriously. Perhaps this is one reason why I urge all the young writers I know to take time out to be in the world they inhabit rather than seeing it through a screen. .

In the last week I read a research paper that hit me, and hard. 
In a paper called ""When do we confront"", it was found that confrontation was a function of status and familiarity and nature of affront. Women were more likely to confront sexism when it came from.someone familiar and were peers. 
But here's the uncomfortable truth. They created a typology of the type of sexism and created 3 - a. Sexist remarks b. Unfairness c. Sexual attention. 
Women were less likely to confront when it is sexual attention. While the paper did not deep dive into this nugget, it got me thinking. 
How frightening it is, that somewhere deep down, we still believe that we are responsible for the dress down that we get. For the contours of our body. For the biological shape of our body. Sexuality was never about nudity. Skin is skin is skin and nothing more. 
Women, confront. Their eyes undressing is a remark on their immaturity, not on your virtue. But you already know this, Don't you?

While I agree with your advice, there just might be a reason why the numbers are relatively low for such type. The risk of an immediate negative response of the perpetrator might be such a deterrent. But yes, on the other side of the coin, if confrontation is postponed or not pursued at all, the perpetrator is left free to continue to be sexist uncorrected.|💛",81

1083,1083,"I recently bought this book for my children, and also a little for myself, because I'm a book addict, I'm curious for history, myths and legends and I love good illustrations. It's ""Geheimnisvolle Welt"" (which translates to ""Secret World"") by Astrid Otte, Elke Schwalm and Timo Grubing (@timogrubing_illustration), published by Circon Verlag (@circonverlag). As soon as we started reading, I noticed there was something very wrong with it. Not so much in terms of the topics and the information content, which is really interesting and well worded, but it was the illustrations that seriously caught my attention. I collected the most obvious ones here - swipe through to get an idea. Can you see it?

The book is about interesting and mysterious things that have (or have not) happened in nature, history and evolution - think of Freemasonry, Loch Ness, Aurora Borealis and such. Two young teenagers, a girl and a boy, travel through the pages, being part of some of the scenes.

Sometimes they're shown in equal positions, like standing next to one another. And sometimes, one of them is clearly the leader while the other is shown much smaller, anxious and weak. Now guess in how many percent of these cases the boy is the leader, and the girl is in the weaker position? Got it. 100%. Since I started thinking a lot about feminism and sexism a few years ago, I've become more and more sensitive to things like this. Sexism that doesn't hit your eye at the very first glance, like having a red, blinking arrow pointing at it, but that walks in silently, unnoticed. And still it leaves traces. It shows our daughters what role they're meant to be in. It shows them their words don't weigh as much as those of their brothers. It shows them that no matter how strong, clever or talented they might be, there'll always be a man who'll get the job. 
And yes, of course I have experienced this in person. Is there any woman on this planet who hasn't?

I try to raise my kids, the boy and the girls, equally, giving them a sense of fairness and gender equality. But wow, sometimes I have the feeling the world is fighting back at me.

I initially brushed it off, but the more I experienced it, the more it pissed me off. I stood up for myself and I was told I would not be welcomed back as a coach, even if my daughter played. We both decided it was no longer the team for us and moved on. I do see it more now - I think I’m just more aware, especially because I see my teen daughters and don’t want them to have to face sexist attitudes and behaviors.|I really love the blog @buuu.ch for recommendations for divers  books for children.|These kind of things. Every single day. All over 😡|I think it’s pretty harmless in this instance. Look at it this way: if you and hubby are driving along and get a flat tire, who’s going to change it? Who’s expected to change it, or fix a leaky faucet, or dig a hole, or carry a heavy box? Masculinity is needed and appreciated if you ask me. 😃|I saw that too.

Er hat uns tatsächlich eine schlechte Note gegeben, weil wir zu dem ""falschen"" Ergebnis gekommen sind. Unsere Recherche war einwandfrei! Das Ergebnis war richtig! Aber der Herr Professor wollte hören, dass das alles nicht so schlimm und nur Propaganda ist. Ich ärger mich heute noch drüber.|WOW!  And this is a new book?  I would expect better....|I’m seeing it more and more as I myself, started to open my eyes to how much sexism we are still being raised in. The other day I went to return a dress and the worker addressed my boyfriend with “Women right? They always take their time with clothes.” I was aghast! Before I could speak my boyfriend said, “hey no need to be a sexist. Men or women can take as much time as they want. Please learn to respect my girlfriend and everyone around you.” Well I’m glad he said something because my blood pressure went up and I was about to explode! My own uncle says he doesn’t see how sexism exists yet I see it even in movies or work life. Told him well walk in a woman’s shoes for a few days and you won’t be saying how things are unfair that you have to walk on eggshells. Sorry rant. The dress thing happened on the day of my boyfriend’s mother’s funeral in late June. I was already crazy stressed that day.|I notice this exact thing in the movies and books I share with my little ones. I feel like I take all the fun and magic out of them sometimes because I keep pointing out the things that should have been written or drawn differently.

Luckily, I have a husband who also sees it and notes it for our kids. Little by little, whether behind the scenes or leading by example, I try to do my part to change it and raise kids who will also do the same.|You’re absolutely right in your interpretation of these illustrations.
I’m raising two young feminist girls (twins), and we’ve had many discussions about the “secret codes” that hide in our language — spoken, written and visual — that teach and perpetuate sexism, as well as racism, homophobia, xenophobia and other forms of bigotry.

Male judges dominate tournaments because karate is still a male dominated sport. They will compliment her on her strength,  power, agility, etc. Her nickname is Fierce. After judging her, they'll walk over to my husband (who's a pretty big guy) and make some ""you're gonna need a big stick to keep the boys away from her"" comment. Fortunately, he'll roll his eyes and remind them that she's capable of keeping ""the boys"" away from herself. She was also quick to point out that even though 95% of the tournaments she competes in are co-ed, 95% of the tropies have male figures on them.|Check their books : @rebelgirls.

This is so overdue. But honestly, everything happens for a reason. Kind of glad a few months have passed, it has given me a chance to not only appreciate how much we have accomplished, but to also realize how much support is being built around this topic.

It has always been something we don’t discuss openly, instead it was discussed with shame & guilt. NOT ANYMORE! I’m here to break the silence...whether you like it or not and I have found such an amazing network of women & men who are set out to do exactly the same.

You can’t imagine how much courage it takes to speak your truth without choking up just to set an example and to make a change. From the bottom of my heart, I thank each and every single one of you that made this 2nd #metoo event possible. It was a huge task and you will never know how much it means to me. Your support has set me and hundreds others free after years of torture and silence. I have never been happier or more at peace than I am now. Now it's time to help the others who haven't found that peace. 💖💗❤

1098,1098,"It's not always easy to convince someone a need exists, if they don't have that need themselves.- Caroline Criado Perez, Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men
——
Yesterday I listened to a German podcast from a famous newspaper and the episode was about gender-gap in medicine. 🌸 How most pills and drugs are only tested on young and healthy white males, which in return means they don’t really work so well on women. Part of the reason why that is, is that women‘s cycles are too unpredictable for science, so it screws up their plan and timeline during drug testing. Way to work with nature. Another reason is that women carry babies and during drug testing they could either lose them if they’re already pregnant or become infertile. Good reasons to avoid women in fertile years, but what about women in and after menopause? 🌸 Also did you know that more women die of heart attacks than men? The reason for it, is that female symptoms are way different then the classical male symptoms of chest pain and a tingling arm. Most women experience unnoticed heart attack symptoms over weeks simply because they can’t read the signs. 🌸 Cars are designed for males. Women are less safe during car accidents because airbags are wrongly placed for them. 🌸 Women make up more than half of the world’s population and yet we are still invisible for our society and economy.",everydaysexism,"|#feminism #feminist #womensrights #womensissues #fightforequality #genderequality #WomensReality #TimesUp #NoMoore #ImWithHer #EverydaySexism #ToTheGirls #YesAllWomen #blogger #blogger_de #austrianblogger #germanblogger #livethelittlethings #lovedailydose #liveauthentic #thatsdarling #darlingmovement #openmyworld|So schön 😍|Freedom 🧡|Mega schön 😍|Du bist Mega hübsch ☺️|Krass diesen Podcast muss ich mir auf jeden Fall auch anhören 🙏|So ist eine meine Liebe 😍 Hammer 😍 geniess den Tag 😍|Uii so so schön✨😍❤️|Oh wow so schön 😍|Tolles Bild😍💕|Wow🥰❤️ wunderschönes Bild 🌸💕|Wow sehr schönes Bild 😍|Den muss ich mir anhören hübsche 😘|The podcast sounds so interesting ☺️|Ich kann die eine Seite total verstehen und bin voll bei dir, allerdings ist es gerade eben mit dem Medikamententesting echt so eine Sache...

Men get paid 9% and the women get paid 13% I believe. If the women are earning less, surely it's purely because of overall revenue.|Non of the people I know watched it.|I think pay should be based on the revenue that a team brings in period. Such as a percentage of the revenue made each game should go to the players. It should not be based on gender at all since they are separate entities within that sport, if the argument is about pay, then look to the percentages players are paid off of the total revenue.|Women’s soccer players make 13 percent of the profit and men make 9 percent because more people attend the men’s game so the women teams get a higher percentage|The reason women don’t get paid the same amount is due to “liability”. Females get pregnant, have different diseases, etc...|Of course|No. Based on percentage they get payed more. The women’s World Cup generates about 150 million dollars and 22% of that is payed out to the teams. The men’s World Cup generates about 6 billion and only 6 percent of that is payed out to the men’s teams.

Unfortunately Women's sports don't draw in the same volume of viewers as men's, regardless of how good or bad they may be.|No, women soccer teams don't generate as much as mens scoccer teams|The thing is... the sporting area is based on revenue, and women’s sports don’t generate the same revenue as men. Whether it be woman’s World Cup, or WNBA, if the money isn’t there, how can equal pay be achievable?|No|Yes 👏 and it’s sad that a World Cup has prove that women should be getting equal pay.|Yes, but here is the thing. In my argument, I compare it to the wnba. Very little people watch the wnba, I think the top salary is like 100,000. But if you look at the nba, more people watch it. Therefore, they make more money. So the revenue is mostly based on viewers and attires. And please correct me if I'm wrong, but I bet my whole life that more people support the mens soccer team compared to the women's. If that's how it is, then why would there have to be equal pay?|Yes|Because of people’s brainwashed minds, women’s sports just don’t get as much of an audience as men’s. Therefore, they can’t pay them the same amount if they aren’t making that money. It is the audience who pay to watch a men’s game that mean women get less pay. But obviously sometimes their choice is based on what they have been told like women sports are boring and women shouldn’t play sports etc|Yes, I don't know why this is even discussed|Truth is women get paid MORE. women get 1 percent of the profit while men got 9. Feminists need to shut the fuck up if they don't know the statistics|Well yea but good luck trying to pay them the same amount as men. Men’s soccer has a much bigger following and viewers. They just simply generate much more revenue. So they can pay them as high as they are right now.|No men’s soccer has more fans and followers men get payed what they get payed based on the income of the sport same with the women|The whole reason females may get paid fewer amounts than the males do is purely the popularity of those two combined. I mean within the spectators popularity right. So arguably more ppl watch male soccer than female soccer. So arguably that brings in more revenue.|YAS🔥|Yes, because in my opinion you should get paid depending on how you do your job, not on how much you sell|yeah|they out in an equal amount of work, and were a lot more successful|They deserve more than m am because they are ACTUALLY winning|no, womens soccer sucks|No, women's soccer doesn't generate as much viewers as men's. Hence their job brings in less money and hence they are payed less.|They deserve equal percentage. Which they don't have, either. Equal percentage of revenue, who's with me?|Thats not how it works dammit|Yes of course|Yes they do. They earned it|Women soccer and men soccer are like two different sports. So No|No... People don't realize pays in sport don't work like regular jobs. If women generated the same or larger audience than men then they'd have a bigger pay. But rn that isn't the case, it's as simple as that.|beat the men’s team and it’s all theirs|If they bring in enough money as men then yes they do . But people are really stupid when they say woman deserve the same pay as men, if WNBA players got millions a year then the WNBA won’t have enough money to survive. So it depends|It’s not pay - it’s sponsorship. Literally no one watches the women’s sports, so no one will advertise there. Simple marketing. If they want more money they can just identify as a male and play on the male teams|To be brutally honest soccer should be terminated as a sport in general it sucks balls|Nobody watches women’s soccer boring ass sport who watches that shit|No, they don't bring in the same money.|If they had the same fan base then yes, but they don't do no|Sports entertainers get paid based on sponsors. They should get paid accordingly.|Here's how I see it. The team that generates more revenue should get paid more. You cant just expect more just cuz they get more. If they generated just as much or even more revenue, there would be no problem whatsoever. This is also an issue in the WNBA it's not gender based, it's that the teams will most likely go bankrupt if they pay the same more.|No it is simple math. Higher revenue brought in=higher salaries|They do get paid more already|it suck cause they do wayyyy better than the US male soccer team, and they totally deserve more, but male soccer teams get more attention and recognition. so in a way i guess yes and no?|No, nobody watches women's sports|No. I don't care if you scored 1 goal every minute. The amount of money they make depends on the amount of revenue they generate|No, this shouldn’t even be a debate. There’s a big difference between the revenue generated in men’s and women’s football.|Women should get money as boys smell bad|No they don’t. They aren’t as skilled as the men and they draw in less money|The men's world cup generates more money,I assume, therefore: No. I also hear no one complaining about how female models get paid way more than male models. Well,  that's 'cause the demand for and the profit generared by female models is much higher. Equal work equal pay. Unequal work, unequal pay.|why is deciding on whether people are paid the same amount for the same job necessary|Look. Say me and a female counterpart both sell oranges. She constantly wins “best orange” awards but people still enjoy mine more. So I make more money. It doesn’t matter how good her oranges are and how she keeps proving hers a good, people still are preferring mine and therefor buying them. The men’s team brings in far more sales and is immensely more popular than the female team. There is no sexism going on here it’s simply that they don’t bring in the sales to keep up.|They do uff you look at the income to revenue rate|It’s basic math, the men’s team generates more revenue income therefore the men are paid more. If the women were paid as much as the men eventually they won’t be able to play at all as the sport will go bankrupt. Hopefully they do soon begin to generate more interest and we’re heading down the track for that. But for now they should be paid less than the men just because it isn’t physically possible to pay them the insane amount the men get.|No... they are still not as good as the mens. Better athletes get more money.... just the way it is🤷‍♂️|It seems that their payment is a direct reflection of the revenue the sport brings in. It's not a matter of unequal payment, but of unequal promotion and public interest. They should be getting equal pay, but I understand why they're not.|No because they don’t bring in the same sales but they certainly should get more pay than they currently do because of that win|You better believe it|The mens athletes are over paid. All athletes are over paid once they hit pro.|Except for the kneeler lol. Anyway, they should get a corresponding cut of the proceeds THEY created. Which brings me to the question, which creates more money, Male or Female Soccer/Football?|Yes then we shall also pay the triple A players in baseball the same as major league bc they are all people doing the same thing right? Make more sales you get more pay simple lol|Yes, if not more. The woman's team not only qualified but they won it, comparing to the men's who never even qualified.|The only reason the men are getting more is because it has a bigger fan base. Also ladies, next time, dont drop the flag.|Only if chicks gonna start watching football. But you all don’t support your girls why the fuck should we pay them 🤷‍♂️|You all do realize... that in the U.S. (for those of you that will come at me, not international, just in the U.S.) the uswnt brings in more revenue than men and make substantially less. It’s completely ridiculous and unfair. This is not including mls or other countries. Just the U.S. national team so don’t come at me bringing in different stats|abolish the wage system entirely|More people watch men's sports as a whole therefore more revenue which means they can pay players more ... It's just facts that women sports don't pull the same numbers so therefore they don't get paid the same numbers|Hell yes|Here we are, debating about the rich not being paid as much as other rich, if this is the kind of problem you have in your first world countries, I envy you guys|No|How does it affect you how they’re paid? Just say you hate women and move on|Think about this from a business owners perspective if women really got paid less and it was a constant that people paid women less why would a business ever employ men and just only use women because it would cute they’re costs down insanely|Compared to how disappointing our mens team is, yes they do|If they bring in the same crowds then sure pay them the same... that's why they dont get paid as much as it is. It's not based on how well they do it's based on the crowds they pull. Viewership not skill.|Incoming feminists|Messi gets the most pay at Barcelona because he brings in the most revenue for the team through jersey sales and other merchandise. He's also a major reason for most people coming to watch FC Barcelona, which brings in ticket sales. Men's football players get payed more because of the revenue they bring to FIFA or UEFA. They sell more jerseys than the women, bring in more audience than the women, and just overall are better for advertising purposes because they're so popular. The women can't get payed the same amount as them because they don't bring in the same amount of revenue to FIFA. It's like Lonzo Ball asking for the same pay as LeBron or Eberle asking for the same pay as McDavid. It doesn't make sense|Equal or more pay .|No because a) men’s football brings in a higher audience and b) money in football has ruined it for men with players not caring as much about the game and their new cars more|Shouldn't depend on who wins, but on who generates most money. A higher income should mean a higher pay, thats obvious. Fact is, mens team generated quite more money then womens teams, and if you look at it money wise, women are actually overpaid compared to what they bring in, so maybe not push it🤷🏻‍♂️|The women’s team is more successful then the men’s the should be getting paid more|Do they make as much revenue as men? They deserve to get payed according to the revenue they make.|No|As the women’s get more popular and better their pay should increase just like a men’s team better+popular=more fans= more money|No comparison at all to men’s football, I hope the women’s game grows and gets the credit it deserves, but You could put an under 17 male team out against England women and win with comfort|Dont know if this is relevant, but for a a WORLD CUP I saw a lot of mistakes that shouldn’t happen in football. Nor less a Wold cup.|Well it depends on what ya did and where you placed in my opinion|bruh ppl are saying no cuz not that many ppl watch it. NO ONE WATCHES IT CUZ THEIR WOMEN  thats the ONLY reason and they won 4times men have won 0 IN FACT WOMEN DESERVE MORE|That would depend on if they brought as much money in. They don't in English woman's football. So it's a no from me.|Yesss|Don’t confuse revenue with unequal pay|Whether they deserve it or not is irrelevant; the football companies cannot make profit by giving them more money. The amount given as a reward reflects international viewing of the cup. If as many people watched and were  entertained by women’s football as men’s, then they would be paid the same. That’s the truth; the big co-operations make their decisions on cash prizes based on the amount money they get from the event. It would be nice to get equal pay, but until equal fan base, it’s highly unlikely. It’s not sexism, it’s business.|No|no that would be stupid they get payed for how much money they make the league and not many people watch women's soccer|The women get 13% of what their event generates. The men only get 9% #equalpay|If women want better pay they need to take the jobs that pay more. I'm not gonna stop you from becoming something better just don't try and rub it in our faces|Do you even watch woman's soccor?  If you dont but agree that they should get paid more,  then you're the reason why they don't get paid the same.|They should get payed more for bringing in more revenue then the men's team. Similarly womens teams in other countries deserve to get paid less because they bring in less revenue. It's just basic economics it's nothing to do with gender or sexism.|So in view, yea why wouldn't they get better pay but the problem is, that they dont generate as much money it isn't a ""who's better game"" especially with sports it's a ""who generates the most money game"" if the women surpass the men than yea the woman get even higher pay but still if anything if people want the women to get more revenue than why not just try and market them better? Its obvious that the US women's are dominant so why not try and spread it out more? Because in very rare circumstances can THE fans actually do something and that's just by trying to get them more known and for people to watch the games. If more people see it, the more revenue comes to them so THE fans can really do something to it. I'm not trying to sound sexist or anything but that's how sports business works, and in this case what could help the women's team more is better sports marketing|Let’s settle this Men’s versus Women’s U.S teams let’s see who wins|No.|A big fat NO.... You dont get payed for what you win, you get payed by The amount of money you rack in....|They already get more % out of the revenue they make. They get 20%of the amount of money they bring in, the men's team only get 7% of what they make, so maybe the woman's team should watch there privilege,  bc let's be honest, a average under 12 boys soccer team will whoop there asses,  woman sports just are not as entertaining as men's sports, most specially wen it comes to team sport. Tennis,  swim, motorsport and  a few others are the exception,  but even in those men tend to do 100% better still and its only the really exceptional woman that make the cut in those sports. And don't come with ""it's society "" bull shit. Stop reengineering society you insignificant brainbead dictator.|They really should considering they're better.|Still no|But I should be paid the same as my college, he is a better worker but i try so i deserve the same pay|If they generate as much of an audience then of course!|Hell ya|They deserve the equal pay, but it’s just a fact that men’s football draw a lot more tickets and broadcasting revenue. If all members of that team get paid like 100k a week, they’d go bankrupt pretty much instantly|They actually get more, 13% when men only get 9%|These comparisons are ridiculous they're 2 completely different sports. All about the money involved in the game sponsorships media coverage and exposure at the moment the woman's game is light years behind the mens game in every aspect. Similar comparison would be asking if the amateur competitors in any sport should be on the same pay as the professionals in that particular sport. Doesn't make sense.|Hell yes!|You don’t “deserve” any type of pay simply cause of your gender. As all sports, you get paid more if you bring in more revenue. That’s how it goes.|In 2017 the US women’s national team lost to a team of 15 year old and under boys. But they really think they deserve the same pay as grown ass men simply cause of their gender? Gtfo|Yes.|Yes, they should because they won the world cup|Yes do that while we are at it, let’s make minimum wage nearly the same as salary. So we can all be equal. So the hardest worker can be paid the same as the laziest worker. What a perfect world.|No they should earn money based on how much they bring in, so it will be based on sponsorship deals and views. It’s the equivalent of a local man singing in a pub and saying it’s sexist if he doesn’t earn the same as Ariana Grande|YES. the women generate more revenue than the men. they’ve won four world cups while the men have won zero. the women’s team gets paid less to win a game than the men do to LOSE one. in no way is that fair at all. they’re performing much better than the men, bringing in more money, yet getting paid less. I call bullshit.|Woman shouldn’t be paid the same cos they are absolutely terrible|Not necessarily the same, but definitely more|I think they should be paid equal percentages, for example, both teams get 10% of revenue or something like that. The women just don’t make as much revenue as men|No. Not as many fans|They shouldn't be called the US team because all they do is disrespect us.|I think they DESERVE equal pay without a doubt. Although, since they don't pull in close to as many viewers it's unlikely that they will be getting equal pay.|Whichever generates more revenue should pay the athletes more. It’s not the men’s fault that they are more popular and have more fans than the womens|The men’s World Cup generate $6 billion in revenue. the female World Cup generates around 131 million|Men’s World Cup generates 6 billion, women’s World Cup generates 131 mil. Thats like saying a company that brings in 100k a year should pay employees the same as CEOs earn at large corporations|When they generate equal amounts of revenue, then sure.|If you compare the payouts of the teams to the amount of revenue generated by the tournaments, the women are actually paid a bigger share of the money they bring in. Heres how Forbes explained it: ""The men still pull the World Cup money wagon. The men’s World Cup in Russia generated over $6 billion in revenue, with the participating teams sharing $400 million, less than 7% of revenue. Meanwhile, the Women’s World Cup is expected to earn $131 million for the full four-year cycle 2019-22 and dole out $30 million to the participating teams."" Important note, $30 million out of $131 million is about 23%. Essentially the women are being paid a larger share of the money they bring in to the organizatiom than the men are.|they deserve equal pay. from 2016 to 2018 the women’s US team generated $1.9 million dollars more than the men’s team. they have won the world cup 4 times, the men’s team has won 0. they are called american heroes, but apparently heroes don’t deserve equal pay in america?|The 15 year old boys should be getting paid more than these 🤡s.|Yes they absolutely deserve as much pay if not more. They deserve it because they have gone farther. Oh but wait...money doesn’t fucking grow on trees. Get that through y’all brains|Everyone that said the woean should make more than the men don’t know the facts. The men have more fans which means more tickets sold and more merchandise purchased. The women actually get paid a higher percentage of the club earnings than the men. The fact is the club isn’t generating enough income to pay the women. It has nothing to do with gender equality it is all about sales and business. The women make less because the club makes less. The men make more because the club makes more. It’s as simple as that. So if u want them to make more buy tickets to actively watch the game or purchase some of their merchandise.|Oh my gosh they just want more money, if they want more get more fans and do it themselves|Then generate the same revenue|Not if there is as much money  in the business|Should just do what the British do and donate it all|No still not as popular as mens and sponsors are not there they dont get less pay for being women they do cause not as many people watch them lol|The simple answer is yes if you look at the amount of viewers this World Cup got compared to the last years men’s World Cup you will see there were more viewers watching this years World Cup.|yeah, the men don’t make it far at all... they kinda suck|Money has to come from somewhere if men are getting more media coverage then they deserve more|No... they Men brought in 6 billion... the women brought in 125 million. The men get 7% of the cut.. the women each get 25%... they do get paid more...🤣🤣🤣🤣|Do people seriously, unironically think that there are men who pay women less based purely on their gender? Its not the fucking 1800s you simpletons, it doesnt happen just face it and stop being a victim|No|They deserve to be payed evenly but can’t get the same pay if they don’t bring in the same revenue, that’s just not how it works|@haydenrhysclowes men didn't have World Cup in 2015 so obviously the woman would've had more revenue cause they actually had a world event|not funny didn’t laugh|They deserve MORE pay than the men’s in fact.|Depends on revenue|It depends on the tickets sold and views ig|Idk what the pay is for either team but the way it works is that sports is an entertainment industry.  Whichever team brings in more revenue is the team that gets payed more.  It's not inequality it's how economy works and this is the case for every sports team|They only get paid however much they generate though, I am correct?|What are you talking about, the mens team generated 6 billion in the 2018 world cup. No where near what women are bringing in.|The women’s World Cup brings in many American sales and American viewership because of the performance of our women’s team, but the us isn’t the only country and in other countries the viewership is way way way higher for the men’s World Cup. They even stated that to promote equal pay that people should buy jerseys and spread the word about the event, basically meaning that they don’t get as many sales.|No they don't. They are not that good compared to the mens. Men are way better.|Deserve, yes. Is it possible? Not yet. A majority of sports profit comes from merch, adverts, sponser etc the only reason women are not getting equal payis because its not as popular - thats how it works in Football|When they generate as much money as the men sure! But until then no you get what you put in it’s not that difficult to comprehend.
And one other thing to those people saying the USA women’s team won more times they deserve more that’s a load of shit, the men’s team has way harder opponents first of all, second of all I guarantee you that if the women’s team played any of the teams the men’s one did they’d get clobbered and lastly they also lost to a group of 15 year old boys they are far from professional and as far as I’m concerned they get more money and attention than they’re worth|Women’s soccer earns more than men’s, when you compare how much they make compared to how much the players get... women’s players earn about 20% of what is made by the league while men only get 7%. Numbers don’t care about feelings🤣|Put the women against the men team then decide|I deleted my comment because a lot of these boys are rude and disrespectful. I want equality. Women should be paid equal to men. No argument. Women deserve the same payment as men no matter what job. If they are doing the exact same thing they should be paid the exact same amount of money.|No they dont its not about gender they dont have nearly as many ticket sales as the mens soccer thus shouldn't be payed equal|Anyone who says no dosnt watch soccer|If you’re an employer and you have two employees doing the same thing but you can only keep one which do you keep? The one who does a better job or the one who brings more people to your business but does a crappy job|If they bring in the same amount they get the same amount.|@debates2u Why are you call it ‘soccer’, don’t encourage the inaccuracies American English. The game is called FOOTBALL! But I’m on the fence, a part of me says yes they should (equal pay and all that) but the other part me would say no because calibre comes in to it, men’s football is more prestigious and brings in more attention which probably explains why they get paid more. But to reiterate its football not ‘soccer’.. the second F in FIFA stands for football.|It only depends on the public they move|No|They shouldn't be ""because they win the world cup"" but because they work as hard.|When male supermodels demand equal pay then we might start the argument🙈|Nahhhh|Yes. It should’ve even be a question.|Yea sure once they bring in the revenue that the men’s team brings.|Hell yea. Tf?👀|Noo|They definately DESERVE equal pay yes.|No, they don’t, they don’t get enough revenue|Yes!!!!|No they need to bring in equal revenue.|No|The women get paid a higher percentage of revenue than men tho|Yaaassssss💕😊👌👊!!!!!!!!!!!!!|#equalpay|No|@debates2u when they can beat a men's team then they can ask for same pay|Do they DESERVE it? Yeah, just as I think that doctors DESERVE more money than youtubers. But anyone with a basic understanding of economics knows it won’t work like that, and same with sports.|Yeah they do deserve equal pay, it really shows in their gameplay, but that doesn’t mean we should give equal pay to WNBA players|it's so frustrating because i really want to say yes. the women's soccer team is really much better than the men's, but they just don't bring in enough money to get paid more. i still think maybe they could be payed a little more than they are now, seeing as they are winning world cups and men cant even get into the first round|If the women pull in more money than the men’s team yes they deserve equal pay if they don’t then no|They have won 4 world cups and are still payed less than the men who didn’t even get to semifinals 😂|They generate less money than the men, but that’s not their fault .they are technically better players (they won 4worldcups the men didn’t even get to finals) there’s nothing else they can do . People just don’t follow female soccer as much as male soccer .its not the players fault there is literally no bigger award they can win|Yes. They do a hecka lot better than the guys|Once again how much they get paid depends on ticket sales, popularity and views, not just wins.|Firstly protest isn’t inherently unpaitriotic secondary you very much can|All sports players pay is directly related to the revenue they bring in. Mens sports are more popular therefore they make more for the owners and advertisers so they make more money. Its not a complicated concept yet people cant seem to wrap their heads around it. 🤦🏻‍♂️|Men's world Cup generates 45x the revenue of the women's world Cup. The men are only paid 15x more than the women. If anything, the women's world Cup champions should be getting paid less.|Um yes what’s the difference between them? Other than the fact that it’s proven men the average man in stronger than the average woman they should be the same pay.|Clearly not. Not only for marketing and brand reasons (women don't move the same as men, and this happens with modelling or beauty products right in the opposite way) but also in terms of rationality, historically soccer's been associated with men and the game is far more competitive than the one of women.|They get paid on how many viewers and seat are sold I think|yes of course!|Of course but until they increase their revenue they aren't gonna get it. They actually earn more percentage of their revenue than the mens. They really are bitching about nothing. They need to get more revenue to get more pay. Basic economics isn't sexist...|Ok I'm leaving it at this. Women, no matter what, should be paid the same as men for the same job. This includes all sports activities like soccer. These women deserve the same amount of money as the men do|I'd say only if they have the same popularity, Its not like they're not paying men and women the same bc of sexism it's bc men's sports are more popular and get more money bc of that|2018 world cup generated $4.6bn and the 2019 Women's world cup generated $131m so financially no and quality wise let's be honest like its nowhere near the quality of men's football|Supply/Demand ppl. It’s not about skill and never has been. They deserve to be paid more than the men’s team but that’s not how basic economics works|Women’s soccer brought in more money than the men’s in the US so there is no excuse for why they are being paid a quarter of what the men are being paid|Sports pay is based off of popularity of the sport not gender, if anyone wants to get paid more in their sport they need more people to be interested and watch it, buy merch from it, get sponsors, etc. for example the WNBA gets way less viewers than NBA because people are not as interested for their own reasons, resulting from this is that WNBA players get paid way less. My point is that the pay difference is based off of popularity and viewers not gender so don’t make it something it’s not.|This is just pandering to the public. Men’s football makes more money so men in football make more money it really is as simple as that.|No, because more people go to see the men’s team play. The money doesn’t come from our tax dollars or something you can just divide among the soccer team. It comes from ticket sales, publicity, donations, etc.. Yeah the men’s team is really bad, but more people come to see there games. The men’s team generates more money, so they get paid more. More people watch men’s soccer than women’s.|Ya|Nope. They hate America|let’s see the women’s team play the men’s team 🤡|They deserve MORE than the US men’s team since they won 🤦🏻‍♀️|Hell no that’s so stupid|It makes sense for fifa to pay the men’s team more because they pull in more revenue, however, US Soccer should be paying women equally (if not more) due to the women’s teams merrits|Yes they do|If you and a co worker went into work and one of you produced 10% of the work the other did, at the same job with same experience etc, do you both deserve the same pay? No. The women's teams are far worse (simple ball control is a miracle) and so shouldn't get paid for playing worse than the men|If the womens team is just as good as the mens than yes but if not then no|Men are more broadcasted then females on media therefore it’s right to pay men more likewise if it was the other way round women would be paid more.|The funny thing is women are more privilege then men when it comes to pay because they make %13 of revenue and men only make %9, but men’s team have over 4 billion in revenue and women’s only have 70 million|No if the go off the popularity and revenue, it is like 2 different jobs technically even though they are both soccer|Sure if the views and other things are the same but it's not because of gender.|NO|Yeah|Yeh o rekon they do buy the problem is that the women’s soccer dosent have the same following as the men’s and therefor the pay can’t be the same.|Don't ghey get paid on the viewership|So the men’s soccer team only took 9% while the women’s team took 13% this year.

Both teams put lots of work and dedication into their playing.|Yes they DESERVE more money (If we wanna go by recent championships performance I could even argue more but that’s besides the point) the the problem is that pay is determined by merch sales and viewership.|Do they bring in as much money? If so then yes. If not then where does the money come from?|I just have a question, and before anyone attacks me I think they SHOULD deserve to get payed more but I know they won't because of viewership and stuff. But honest question, apart from international games, what do the players on the women's team do, cuz I never heard about it or anything|No. They don't generate anywhere near as much money as the men's. Furthermore women's teams in general are worse than men's both physically and technically. I tried watching England's women (one of USA's opponents) and they struggled to play simple passes in the final third. Plus if the women's teams get paid the same as the men's, does that mean that the U15 Dallas team that obliterated the USW team should be paid the same as well?|Nope|No. It's all about who watches it and they don't get the same amount of viewers as male athletes. And if you disrespect the US, you shouldn't get to play at all|This isn't a discussion I lowkey think you're spreading miss information by asking this question..|No they don’t generate the same audience, crowds, tickets, jersey sales etc. it’s sad but that’s the reality of it. And sometimes people need to face that|I mean in the usa yes, because the mens football team sucks, but in most countries, nope|Anyone who says yes clearly don’t know how this works at all. If you want the Women’s Team to get more money, but their merch, actively show up to their games, and invite friends to do the same, and stop telling the govt to pay them.|I think men should be payed less. Nobody needs that much money for kicking a ball. I bust my ass everyday all week and I'm no where even close to making the womens pay. So no sympathy from me.|Some of these comments will be like no.. Cause girls are not good enough and weak, geez|No, not as skillfull and entertaining as men|They deserve way more money than what they are getting. They have won the World Cup 4 times now. FOUR. The men have won 0 times. ZERO. The US women’s team also won the World Cup 2 years in a row. Each time they did not make it to the finals, they were third place. Each time they did make it to the finals, but lost and ended up in 2nd place. The men’s team have never gotten that far. Another point, the women’s team get $0 when they lose, the men’s team on the other hand still get PAID when they lose.",1294

1104,1104,"Yes, I have a feminist shelf on my bookcase. No I'm not one of those militant, man-hating, women that most people seem to picture when the word ""feminist"" is bandied about. I just believe that we, as women, have as much to offer the world as men, and that this should be recognised. That we deserve to have the same rights, and to feel safe every day. That it's not about one sex over the other, one race, one faith... It's not about anyone being better or more powerful. We are all valuable and we all have worth. It's about people, humans, us.

1108,1108,"SEXUAL HARASSMENT..
.
.
This article is written in a hugely problematic way.
.
.
Let’s start with the headline. The headline itself tries to justify this man’s disgusting behaviour by explaining that the sexual harassment began after a ‘steamy Christmas party’ - the truth being that the victim had danced sexually with her manager at the party and told him she wasn’t wearing underwear. Yes, that is sexual behaviour. Yes, she seems to be initiating sexual relations with him. However, the headline fails to mention that when the completely unwelcome and unreciprocated workplace sexual harassment began (including kissing her uninvited and without warning, putting his hands inside her clothing, sitting her on his knee, asking her for sex/sexual favours and much more than just the question in the headline), the victim made it very clear that she was not interested. She made it very clear that she felt uncomfortable and yet it continued. At this point, any sexual behaviour at a work Christmas party is null, void and irrelevant to the case. This headline fails to really tell the story and depicts the victim as a flakey woman who changed her mind last minute and made a bogus sexual harassment claim.
.
.
Second problem with JUST the headline. The DM seem to try to garner some sympathy for the abuser by explaining his gross and inappropriate behaviour as an ‘infactuation.’ This word has romantic and  passionate connotations. There is nothing romantic or passionate about sexual harassment.
.
.
The body of the article itself goes on to describe him as a family man who has ran an honest business since the 90s. Which is more COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT INFORMATION only included to try to demonise the victim and gain sympathy for the harasser. It invites the comments of how she has ‘ruined his career’ and ‘can’t take a joke’ by reporting his harassment. .
.
If there are any male (or female) followers out there who are unsure of how to approach women and date without being accused of harassment or rape in this #metoo generation we live in, the answer is easy: don’t do anything creepy and you’ll be fine. The linked article is a great starting point for understanding further.",everydaysexism,"|https://medium.com/s/man-interrupted/https-medium-com-zaron3-guide-to-being-a-gentleman-in-the-metoo-era-f87ef12a9caa|#metoo #harveyweinstein #sexualharassment #intersectionalfeminism #timesup #womenempowerment #womensupportingwomen #equality #whyineedfeminism #supportwomen

1111,1111,"“Society grants privilege to people because of certain aspects of their identity. Aspects of a person’s identity can include race, class, gender, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, ability, and religion, to name a few. I feel a responsibility to use my privilege to promote equity for all. My ‘voice’ may carry significant weight within certain groups where people may hear the message differently. When I recognize my own privilege and practice empathy and awareness for those that do not share the same, I am able to experience a humility that is fulfilling and creates gratitude for the opportunities that I have been afforded.

It is important for us to acknowledge privilege in order to challenge social inequities that keep many from finding success in their lives. Gender equity is something I feel very passionate about creating and is why I work with Next Gen Men to facilitate monthly meetings to hold space for conversations that may not be happening around masculinity and gender and how it impacts us all. These are open to all regardless of how they identify and are such rich conversations for all who attend, including myself. The social inequity that currently exists can keep people stuck stifle us to live our best lives. This may be through social norms, gender norms, or even expectations transferred to us from family and friends.

I am now lucky enough to have people seek me out to be a part of their journey toward becoming mentally healthy and enjoying mental wellness. ‘A rising tide lifts all boats.’ By raising opportunity and striving for gender equity for all around us, we are creating a stronger, healthier, and more equitable society to learn from each other and experience the best life possible.”

1113,1113,"Have you ever searched online for the definition of a woman? Besom, piece, bit, bitch, mare, baggage, wench, petticoat, frail, bird, bint, biddy, filly… •
These are the words which the Oxford online dictionary tell us mean the same as ‘woman’. •
These definitions show an appalling level of sexism that is totally unacceptable in today’s society. It must change. 
Maria Beatrice Giovanardi works at a women’s rights startup, and while looking to rebrand she started searching for synonyms of the word ‘woman’ online. She had no idea that this search would reveal such extreme misogyny. 
And as if this wasn’t bad enough, under the definition of ‘woman’ the Oxford Dictionary gives the following examples:
‘Ms September will embody the professional, intelligent yet sexy career woman’;
‘If that does not work, they can become women of the streets’;
‘male fisherfolk who take their catch home for the little woman to gut’;
‘I told you to be home when I get home, little woman’.
These examples show women as sex objects, subordinate, and/or an irritation to men.
As well as all this, the definition of a ‘man’ is much more exhaustive than that of a ‘woman’ - with 25 examples for men, compared to only 5 for women. •
This is completely unacceptable by a reputable source like the Oxford University Press, but it’s even more worrying when you consider how much influence they have in setting norms around our language. These misogynistic definitions have become widespread because search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo license the use of the Oxford English Dictionary for their definitions. 
This is incredibly concerning because it can influence the way that women are spoken about online. Should an institution like the Oxford University Press  portray women this way? What message does this send to young girls about their identity and expectations for the future? If we want to create an equal society, we need language fit for the 21st century that doesn’t discriminate against women. Oxford Dictionary’s team are defining who women are and doing it in a very outdated manner which denigrates women.

The messages we give kids about being girls or boys are so f***ed up.
I've noticed it a lot recently (not that I don't notice all. the. time!) But recently with littlest ones leg in a cast I've heard some really daft things from folk in shops etc about how boys are more energetic, boisterous, adventurous and accident prone than girls. A woman in a cafe on Sunday told my son (5) and daughter (9) that 'boys are braver'. 🙄  I was like WTF?! 😳 Nobody seems to think about the social conditioning that happens Every Time they tell kids these things, or that if you tell someone repeatedly they can't do something, the doubt you've instilled in them will actually hold them back.
Anyway love how this cartoon made me think...we should be encouraging our sons to have female role models and heroes, just as much as our daughters.

Last night I thought I'd reset my mood (all work and no play makes Chhavi a grumpy girl) so I chose to watch ""Bombay to Goa"". I think I watched all of 10 Amitabh movies growing up and I'm trying to remedy that. But, it's tough because the movies are so dated, misogynist, and silly, which makes them hard to watch. The comedy is awful, the stalking is out of control (with heroes like these, who needs villains?), the fight sequences were bearable only in 4x speed, the only thing working is that the drama becomes unintentionally hilarious. What even was the plot of this movie? Amitabh shows up one hour into the film! 2 stars out of 10 instead of 1 for the only delightful bit: a singing cameo by Miss Usha Iyer, whom we all know as Usha Uthup now. In a white and gold saree, big red bindi in place she did a medley mashup with presence, humour, and that voice! I mean, she throws ""I married a female wrestler"" and ""Be bop a Lula"" in the mix!
Now THAT was worth the price of admission.

1133,1133,"“The phenomenon of female anger has often been turned against itself, the figure of the angry woman reframed as threat — not the one who has been harmed, but the one bent on harming. She conjures a lineage of threatening archetypes: the harpy and her talons, the witch and her spells, the medusa and her writhing locks.[…] If an angry woman makes people uneasy, then her more palatable counterpart, the sad woman, summons sympathy more readily. She often looks beautiful in her suffering: ennobled, transfigured, elegant. Angry women are messier. Their pain threatens to cause more collateral damage. It’s as if the prospect of a woman’s anger harming other people threatens to rob her of the social capital she has gained by being wronged. We are most comfortable with female anger when it promises to regulate itself, to refrain from recklessness, to stay civilized.”
— Leslie Jamison, I Used to Insist I Didn’t Get Angry. Not Anymore. (New York Times)",everydaysexism,"|.

Dancehall culture is important to reggae music and Jamaica but perhaps one negative effect is the representation of women painted on bars and strip clubs across #jamaica.

1141,1141,"Not only is this article suggesting that men should do housework and chores in an attempt to get sex from their partner (‘choreplay’, Daily Mail? Really?) as opposed to doing housework and chores because they want to and because they are in fact adults, this article also places the blame for men not contributing the housework onto women. It paints women as control freaks who are unwilling to let their male partners do housework when the problem is that a lot men have been raised in a society where men are often described as ‘hapless’ and ‘hopeless’ and ‘useless’ - there is a discourse of men being unable to do basic jobs around the house and a ‘if you do the job wrong once, she’ll never ask you to do it again’  locker room culture between many men. It is a source of comedy, found often in TV sitcoms - the ‘hapless husband’ left to look after the house on the rare occasion the wife is busy and the whole house and the children end up a hilarious disaster which the women eventually comes home and fixes. If women are reluctant to ‘relinquish control’ of housework, it is because of this ‘men are useless’ trope which is fed to us through advertising, TV and movies. By society doing this, we are enabling men to be ‘hopeless’ and giving them excuses. This issue of the division of household duties is multi-faceted and seriously complex but the Daily Mail really haven’t grasped the problem here at all. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️",everydaysexism,"|#intersectionalfeminism #timesup #womenempowerment #womensupportingwomen #equality #whyineedfeminism #supportwomen

I mean it’s 2019, surely gender discrimination must be a thing of the past now? Well, no. The fact is gender discrimination is so commonplace in our lives that you might not even know that you are at the receiving end of it. Let me give you a few examples if you still have doubts. 💁🏽‍♀️

Last year in August, the Tokyo Medical University confessed to marking down the test scores of female applicants to keep the ratio of women in each class below 30%. In fact, they also admitted that this systematic manipulation had been in effect since 2006. Their argument – women get married or pregnant and then they might drop out and Japan would then run out of doctors. Do I even need to say how ridiculous that sounds? 😡

1177,1177,"《戰勇》的作者春原羅賓遜（春原ロビンソン）在七月一日發推說女兒在幼稚園被欺負，「女生不可以看騎士龍戰隊龍裝者」，小女生很難過。
有個特攝迷（右邊的推）轉了春原老師的推之後說，「雖然我說過很多次了，（再說一次）『發現女孩子在看戰隊或假面騎士的話，男生就應該欺負她到女孩子哭出來』
如此，克服了這番考驗的女孩子，才有喜歡特攝英雄的資格。
要說原因的話，她們一定要認知到
『這是男孩子向作品，只是讓她們寄租而已』」
（髒魚翻成『她們只是男性向內容產品裡的附屬觀眾』，她翻得比較好）

此人另一推，
「如果女孩子沒有身為附帶的自知之明，那就會長成一直生氣氣大吵
『戰隊隊長沒有女生是歧視』
『主角騎士沒有女生是歧視』的搞錯了什麼的大人」

噁斃了。

附帶一提他也說因為特攝是兒童向作品，大人要有身為附帶的自知之明。所以被明石家秋刀魚那樣嘲笑「年過三十了還喜歡英雄w」也是必要之惡。

哪來的標準多多規定只有誰可以喜歡什麼的人啊。
因為性別而主張剝奪某些人的權利，這已經不只是刻板印象，而是歧視行為囉。

1183,1183,"🚩🚩❗Dette teltet står på Roskilde i år. Klara passerer teltet med skriften ""Voldtektstelt"" og blir rasende, vel vitende om at det foregår og anmeldes voldtekter på Roskildefestivalen hvert år! Ingen er i teltet, men da hun og vennindene senere går forbi igjen er det sprayet på teksten ""Nådesløs"" og et hakekors også. Jentene konfronterer guttene som nå sitter ved teltet. Guttene forsvarer spøken og kaller jentene for noen ""feministiske møkkakjerringer"". Nå er det ikke akuratt bare feminister som syntes voldtekt er galt, og man er heller ikke et møkkamenneske for å si fra, men det er man faktisk når man tror det er OK å spøke med dette. For hva er egentlig morsomt? At millioner av kvinner blir voldtatt pr år og får livet sitt ødelagt av kvinneundertrykkende menn? Det er urovekkende at hverken vaktene eller ledelsen på Roskilde ville konfiskere teltet eller ta en prat med guttene. Dette viser den typiske patriarkalske holdningen om at ""gutter er gutter"", ""det er bare en spøk"", ""vil ikke blande meg"", som bagatelliserer sexisme og uakseptable holdninger og setter sin egen mentale komfort foran kvinners sikkerhet og liv. Heldigvis er det en flott og VIKTIG kampanje på Roskilde i år mot sexisme, overgrep og for grensesetting og flørtetolkning i regi av Orange Together og Everyday Sexism Danmark ( Sexisme RF19 på Fb!) som kom å satte gaffateip over ordet og hakekorset. Kvinnehat og nazisme tar livet av tusenvis, og millioner blir voldtatt og utsatt for vold hvert år. Flere burde grepet inn, alle må sette foten ned og det at ikke engang én av guttene i gjengen satt foten ned før dette ble sprayet på teltet viser hvor normalt det er med dårlig kvinnesyn blandt menn. Nei, ikke alle menn, men altfor mange menn og mer enn mange nok til at det er noe alle menn må ta ansvar for og bryte inn mot. Og til jenter som er redd for å bli kalt kjipe feministkjerringer, husk at feminist ikke er et skjellsord, du er ikke kjip for å si fra om uakseptable holdninger, vær stolt og se det som en selvfølge. Det burde alle,for overgrep er ikke ok å spøke med! #whyweneedfeminism #sexisme #roskilde #roskildefestival #festival #sexism #sexist #everydaysexism #hverdagssexisme #feminisme #camping",everydaysexism,"|Fy fan så vidrigt! 😡😡😡|Sånt som dette får jo ingen konsekvenser!

Men de som rakk å få med seg diskusjonen så akuratt årsaken til at feminisme og aktiv fokus på menns holdningsendring mot kvinner er så viktig. Diskusjonen gikk i denne duren og fortsatte med hat på innboks når de skjønte at flere som følger oss reagerte på holdningene dems. Tusen takk til dere andre som bidro til å sette de på plass og til alle som åpent og stolt står opp mot uakseptable holdninger mot kvinner 💕💕 Gutt: ""Voldtekt er jo kjempemoro""
Oss andre: ""Nei det er det ikke.""
Gutt: ""Omg jo for det er jo ikke engang et stort problem!""
Meg: Jo det er det, 1/6 blir utsatt for det. Her har du offisiell forskning. 
Gutt: Fy faen dere feminister misliker menn, jeg står for det jeg sa voldtekt er kult og det er helt greit at andre gutter syns det er moro, det er bare dere som er for sensitive!""
Oss andre: Hvis du syntes det så har du kvinneundertrykkende holdninger og er en dust. 
Gutt: ""Åhhhh shit nå kan jeg politianmelde deg for krenkelser og trusler, for det er du som er en fare for samfunnet ikke jeg og min overgrepsmentalitet som er det! Menn har farligere arbeidsplasser enn kvinner så menn undertrykkes og jeg må få lov å ha min mening uten motargumenter, selvom den er skadelig for alle kvinner i samfunnet, hvis ikke så hater og undertrykker du menn!"" 🙄|@campklunk trampa ner det|Dette blir for dumt... 😳|Slik dårlig humor beviser bare at man mangler antenner",327

पिछले 8 महीनों से जॉब इंटरव्यू के दौरान जागीशा अरोड़ा से ऐसे ही सवाल किए जा रहे हैं। जागीशा ने जॉब इंटरव्यू का अपना अनुभव शेयर करते हुए लिखा है, “इंटरव्यू में मेरी काबिलियत से ज़्यादा, मेरी शादीशुदा ज़िन्दगी के सवाल पूछे जाते हैं”।⠀
⠀
जागीशा का कहना है कि मेरे पति से कभी ये सब नहीं पूछा गया होगा लेकिन मुझसे हर इंटरव्यू में ऐसे सवाल पूछे जा रहे हैं। शादी से पहले जब अपने घर पर थी, तो सवाल आते थे कि घरवाले मानेंगे ना, फलाना जॉब के लिए? अब जब शादी हो गई है, तब वापस से ऐसे ही सवाल।⠀
⠀
जागीशा आगे कहती हैं, ""आप शादी करते हैं, उस इंसान के साथ अपनी ज़िन्दगी बिताने के लिए लेकिन एक महिला के लिए शादी बहुत कुछ लाती है। लोगों की बातें और तमाम वे लोग जो आपको बताते हैं कि आप ऐसा करें या आप वैसा करें। आप यह ठीक नहीं कर रही हैं या आप वह ठीक नहीं कर रही हैं। शादीशुदा होने के बावजूद मैं काम करने की क्षमता रखती हूं, मेहनती भी हूं, अपनी मेहनत की सैलरी और सम्मान कमाने की हकदार भी हूं।""⠀

“I had wings, once, and they were strong. But they were stolen from me. They could carry me above the clouds and into the headwinds, and they never faltered. Not even once.”
Imagine you go to see a friend, and while in their company, you start feeling off before blacking out. When you come to, it’s obvious what has happened to you, and what you went through. You feel dirty, you blame yourself, and you try to pretend it never happened. Cut to a couple months later when you find out you’re pregnant with your rapists baby. Now imagine that you would get more prison time for aborting that baby than your rapist would for abusing, using, and taking advantage of your body. THIS IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA. THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO REAL WOMEN. I recently read that a pregnant woman who got shot in the stomach is being charged for the death of her fetus. This is not right and it is not normal. This needs to be made a HUGE deal. We are in a war right now on women’s bodies. When you take a woman’s rights away from her, you are clipping her wings.

1201,1201,"Betrayal is a beast of an emotion. It's birthed from a place of self hatred and self deception. To be betrayed by those closest to you is the deepest pain that anyone can experience in my opinion. It's a new day in a new space and I see the light, I am the light. One of the biggest lessons I'm learning to realize more and more through this process is that we all live in our own dream we all have demons to face within ourselves, betrayal of another only exposes what is in that person's heart. It's a heart that needs to be fixed, mended and restored. On your journey to recovery don't judge your feelings, allow yourself to feel the pain, the hurt the betrayal, this is the way to release it and let it go. The process is daily. Never let anyone take away your power no matter what projects from there heart, it's not your burden to carry it's there's. Holding space for unconditional love. #trusttheprocess",everydaysexism,"|#believewomen #metoo #timesup #yesallwomen #believesurvivors #womensreality #nomoore #nevermoore #meat14 #iamanastywomen #imwithher #everydaysexism #toothegirls #whyistayed #heforshe #yesallwomen #effyourbeautystandards #fem2 #speakup #domesticviolence #abuse

How does a state with the SECOND HIGHEST INFANT MORTALITY RATE ban abortion, thus creating more children who will die in your broken system?⁣

Maybe you are not religious but I’m sure most people in the state of Alabama is. Abortion is wrong and is a sin it’s written in the bible. I’m sure you don’t care though. If you hate Alabama so much why don’t you save some money and move to a more abortion friendly state. E.g California, Maine, etc. Do you know how to prevent unexpected pregnancies? Get some contraception and if you can’t don’t have sex it’s that easy. Don’t drink, don’t get drugged, and carry a gun on you.

1214,1214,"Ihr kennt sie, die ewige Frage: Was ziehe ich heute an? Schön, dass sich so viele Männer genau darüber lustig machen, wo sie doch ein großer Teil des Problems seid. Trägt eine Frau einen kurzen Rock oder ein knappes Top auf der Straße, lassen die Reaktionen oft nicht lang auf sich warten: Von Beschimpfungen über Maßregelungen bis hin zu unangemessenen Anmachsprüchen – viele von uns erleben all das. JAJA das mag nicht immer so sein, die Häufigkeit lässt mich aber an einer Zufalls-Theorie zweifeln.

Unsere ach so tolerante Gesellschaft kämpft an der Front für Gleichberechtigung, für Selbstliebe und den beschissenen Weltfrieden, rollt aber immer noch heimlich mit den Augen bei einer Frau mit zu tiefem Ausschnitt. Zu kurzem Rock. 
Diese generelle Sexualisierung des weiblichen Körpers kotzt mich gelinde gesagt an. Ich liebe meine Brüste, warum sollte ich die immer hinter T-Shirts verstecken, nur weil sich das Gros der Männer nicht benehmen kann. Und wenn ich noch einmal Sprüche höre wie: „Du bist doch selber schuld, wenn du angemacht/ angeglotzt/ begrapschst oder vergewaltigt wirst, zieh Dich halt nicht so aufreizend an“ höre – dann zünde ich alles an.

Und wisst Ihr was? Ich zieh jetzt einfach an was ich mag – pfeife Bauarbeitern, die oben ohne arbeiten lautstark hinterher. Begrapsche Männer in kurzen Hosen und Sprüche wie „Na Schnucki, wie viel kosten Du und Dein Maurer-Dekolleté denn?“ gehören ab sofort zu meinem täglichen Sprachgebrauch.

Freiheit für die Brüste, die Ärsche und die Bäuche dieser Nation – Raus mit Euch, Ihr seid wunderschön! 🖤",everydaysexism,"|#libertéégalitédécolleté #jekiffemondecollete #feminismus #feminist #gedanken #instatext #frausein #tragwasduliebst #notallmen #jaja #schreiben #gedankenmachen #woman #women #freetheboobsmovement #instawomen #instafeminism #everydaysexism #kunterbuntstattnurdabei|🖤🖤🖤🖤|❤️🙌 preach it|🙌🏻🖤🖤🖤|Isso 👌🏻|Word! ❤|Toll geschrieben!❤️|Sehr geil und aus meinem tiefsten Herzen geschrieben! ♥️Danke 😘|Ja richtig so, du sprichst mir aus der Seele👍🏻|YES.

1219,1219,"In May of 2017 I lost my job and insurance benefits from Harley-Davidson of Scottsdale. At that same time I had just finished my Holistic Nutrition program at school. I had learned all about our modern day food industry and how tainted and toxic the food we consume has become (no thanks to large corporations and our government!). I quickly cut out all processed foods, became plant-based, and purged all of my cosmetics and household cleaners that were also filled with chemicals and toxins. Since my medical insurance was gone and since I was intentionally single and not interested anyways, I decided it was time to cut out birth control to see what my body was like without it. I had been on birth control pills since I was 16 years old and then at 26 decided it was time for a break.
.
Flash forward two years and I finally got a job where medical insurance is available. I essentially pay $100 a month from my paycheck just to get birth control!! Since I have had a period, I have the MOST DISABLING cramps every time. After two years of being off of it and suffering, I wanted to give it another shot after asking my doctor a lot of questions I had never asked before. For years prior I was on a pill called Microgestin Fe. It worked wonders, it didn’t make me crazy, I didn’t gain weight or get acne, my periods were light and like 4 days long, and the best part was I had no cramps. It is now month 2 of being back on the pill after two years off and the pharmacy at Walgreens told me they did not offer Microgestin anymore. So I switched and went to CVS pharmacy for the first time. However, they pulled a fast one on me apparently and gave me the “generic version” of Microgestin called Blisovi Fe. Well.... after two months of this I can tell you that I am feeling pretty hopeless. I looked this drug up and found SOOOO MANY WOMEN who are having the same experience as me. The pharm pulls the switch, the doctors swear it’s the same meds, and the side effects I am experiencing are just the same as these other women. I am ANGRY alllllll the time now. I can go from 0 to 1000 in .0001 seconds!!

Continue in comments.... ⬇️⬇️⬇️",everydaysexism,"|The first month on these pills I woke up sooooo nauseous every day! I thought it was from lack of eating breakfast so I changed that but nope, still no good. I am just now reading these reviews on drugs .com and I kid you not, I just BURST into tears. I have been really struggling with my emotions, thinking about seeking professional help, therapy (although we all could use a therapist!), anger management, life coaching, whatever I can to help control my emotions and pure rage I have inside of me. I mean like I have been seriously so concerned. But now I am just at a loss and totally confused on what to do.

I would recommend keeping on the holistic and natural route and continue to learn your body and the cycles so you can one day pinpoint when you will be ovulating and most fertile. And on the flip side maybe get your men to do the same and have control of themselves and their tool. These 2 methods have always seem to work over the ages, just since big pharma and the food industry change 50 years or so ago has the view point changed IMO.. hit up Ashlee we have been birth control free for almost 10years..|I completely understand the BC struggle. The IUD gave me months of cystic acne and migraines. My doctor even laughed when I told her that I KNEW the IUD caused my cystic acne. She kept saying, “You think”. Sure enough, after removal, the cysts started disappearing and my skin is on the route to recovery. But I was absolutely horrified to continue the search for a new bc. I found that asking the women in my family about their experiences was a huge help in navigating this process and I wish I did it sooner. Trusting my gut and following my intuition was also huge. No one knows your body like you do. I know how frustrating and difficult this process can be and I REALLY hope that you find something that works for you.|❤️|💥",42

I looked for a similar box with a boy (or even a girl and boy) washing dishes on the front with no such luck.

These are the messages that tell society that housework is feminine. AND YES, I HAVE HAD THIS TOLD TO ME BY A MAN AS WELL.

My entire life I have loved things deemed ""masculine"". Fixing things, power tools, getting dirty exploring creeks and climbing trees. I can't believe it's 2019 and this crap is still being sold. It honestly wouldn't bother me if the package was ""unisex"". Disney and Wal-Mart are both leaders in their markets- please send better messages to our boys and girls.

And don't you dare say it's because boys aren't interested... Because I'm not interested in doing your dishes either.

⁣
This is me after SKiM Talks on Friday 28th June held at City Hall London.⁣
⁣
Behind that smile is the journey to establish and get SKiM Talks off the ground. The 'why' behind SKiM Talks. ⁣
⁣
Behind the scenes of SKiM Talks is:⁣
⁣
Pain, the stories of my own sexual violations, hard work, frustration, asking for help,  overcoming depression, overcoming self-doubt, pushing myself hard,  sleepless nights,  having a vision.⁣
⁣
and the realisation that:⁣
SKiM Talks is not a trend, it's part of the I AM SKiM lifestyle. ⁣
The power of prayer and visualisation, the power of self-belief and the acknowledgement that I am supported, having the right people around you, I'm creative and expressive in my own way, a little goes far especially when it's full of heart, prayer and determination. My vibe attracts my tribe. ⁣
⁣
Thank you to every last person who turned up to #skimtalks (it was a full house). ⁣
⁣
For my foundation - those that did more than support me. They captured my vision and ensured it was executed, allowing me to focus on what I needed to do to deliver SKiM Talks. There are no words to express my heart because thank you is really not enough. You came and showed up and out for SKiM Talks.  My people, my friends (yes you can work with your friends) my heart...you are my foundation thank you. ⁣

1226,1226,"If I told you how many holes we had in the walls of each of our many residences I could write a book. Hiding and covering up became exhausting, trying to act as if  Everything was perfect was even more daunting. I grew up in a very religious home where we didn't really deal with our issues we just covered them up as if they didn't exist. But all the while they were festering under the surface. The saying is you attract what you are and many times I blamed myself for being in the abusive relationship I found myself in. However, as I grew stronger I began to take a higher perspective. What if I choose this path, what if I knew I had karma I needed to balance out so that in this lifetime I could learn some of the greatest lessons and ultimately live out my best life. It's easy to play the blame game but after a while it gets old and you wonder is there really a higher purpose for all of this maddness? I can most assuredly say there is and it always involves your personal growth. Inner healing needs to happen for both the Masculine and Feminine energies and I believe that is what is happening at this very moment. Both the Divine Masculine and Feminine are ready to emerge and create a beautiful harmony on this planet. Does that sound crazy or too good to be true? I believe all things are possible, when we look inside ourselves and become self aware. This journey is hard and can be scary to look at the deepest parts of ourselves that we don't want anyone else to see. But the examination is key to our elevation and acsenscion. Take this journey with me check out my campaign and my newest song Believer on YouTube Jeremia Renee links in the description. You are more powerful than you know! *

[Français👇] MANEA 
A name we chose before our baby birth and we discover his sex. Having a girl or a boy wasn’t important to us. And, as his dad said all along the pregnancy, knowing his sex is as interesting as knowing his eye color ... or less!
.
We chose the name Manea because it meets three criteria:
1️⃣ easily pronounceable in the three languages in which our family lives: French, Spanish and English;
2️⃣ without any special character that makes encoding complicated (cedilla ...);
And 3️⃣ we wanted an epicene name: that is written in the same way whatever it is given to a boy or a girl.
.
From the beginning, we wanted to give a special attention to the development of our child by protecting him/her from gender stereotypes, sexism and toxic masculinism.
.
The world in which we live still has a lot of work concerning gender equality ... In all our travels, we have never seen a culture where we could say ""it's good, here it's done ! "".
.
We do not know in which world Manea will evolve when he will be older ... but we dream that some fights of today will be obvious tomorrow.

🇫🇷 MANEA 
Un prénom que nous avons choisi avant que notre bébé ne naisse et que l’on découvre son sexe. Avoir une fille ou un garçon n’était as important pour nous. Et, comme le répétait son papa tout le long de la grossesse, connaître son sexe est aussi intéressant que de connaître sa couleur des yeux... voire moins !
.
Nous avons choisi le prénom Manea car il répond à trois critères : 
1️⃣ facilement prononçable dans les trois langues dans lesquelles notre famille baigne : français, espagnol et anglais ;
2️⃣ sans caractère spécial qui rend l’encodage compliqué (accent, cédille...) ;
Et 3️⃣ nous voulions un prénom épicène : qui s’écrit de la même façon qu’il soit donné à un garçon ou à une fille.
.
Dès le départ, nous avons eu envie d’apporter une attention toute particulière au développement de notre enfant en le protégeant des stéréotypes de genre, du sexisme et du masculinisme toxique. .
Le monde dans lequel nous vivons a encore beaucoup de travail concernant l’égalité des genres... En tout cas nous n’avons encore jamais (SUITE EN COMMENTAIRE 👇)",everydaysexism,"|... En tout cas nous n’avons encore jamais vu de culture où l’on pouvait se dire « c’est bon, ici c’est acquis ! ». .

As the school year comes to a close, many will have children making the transition to secondary school which is where sexting can become the thing to engage with.

He argued with me, asking me to stay and talk to him, i pushed past him and ran.  i ran across a busy street, past a church, i had no where to go.  i heard the man yell out my name, and i sprinted towards the police station.  i hid behind a pillar next to a reflective window and watched, mortified, as the man chased after me, looking for me, charging into the busy streets, hunting for me.  i froze and began to cry, standing there as a grown 31 year old woman, completely in fear for my life and not sure if this guy was done searching for me...
▪️▪️▪️
▪️▪️▪️
Men have such an ability and capacity for instilling fear in women.  The fact that women have been trained our entire life to be cautious exiting yoga studios late at night with our keys gripped tightly between our knuckles did not prepare me for the fact that it would happen to me...i didn’t even have keys! And it was not even a stranger, it was someone i knew
▪️▪️▪️
although comparatively minor, it infuriates me; i am angry that men out there think this is acceptable to terrorize women and any objections are just labeled “hysteria.” we must help our men find their way back to the path of goodness and empower them to not use their masculinity for intimidation but for liberation from #toxicbehaviors
▪️▪️▪️
And more importantly, men who are loving and kind and thoughtful about their power, i see you and i appreciate you now more than ever ▪️

In a lot of ways I am definitely a girly girl. I happen to think little girls clothes are adorable (I am particularly in love with rufflebum pants). Today I was shocked by the length difference in the two shorts. Am I being overly sensitive or are we teaching children this young that girls need to show more skin to be cute?

[Français👇] ""What a pretty little girl! »
""What a strong baby boy! ""

This is the kind of messages that Manea receives. 👧 When people think he's a girl, compliments are about his looks, sweetness, smiles and the bond to his mom. 👦 When people think he's a boy, they congratulate him for his skills, his evolution, his size and weight, and they imagine him in the near future playing football with his dad.

Just for a question of gender, for such a small baby who doesn’t care about stereotypes related to his biology, people send him messages totally different.

That's just crazy !😱 And that's only for the messages of strangers in the streets. But it's much more global than that: fashion and toys are so gendered! To find neutral clothes is very difficult! 🤷‍♀️ And you ? What do you think ? Have you also noticed these gender stereotypes around your babies and your children? How do you react?
•
•
•
🇫🇷 « Quel jolie petite fille ! Si souriante ». « Quel beau bébé curieux et costaud ! »

C’est le genre de messages que Manea reçoit. 👧 Quand on pense que c’est une fille, on le complimente davantage sur son physique, sa douceur, ses sourires et le lien à sa maman. 👦 Quand on pense que c’est un garçon, on le félicite pour ses prouesses motrices, on vante son évolution, sa taille et son poids, et on l’imagine dans un futur proche jouant au foot avec son papa.

Juste pour une question de genre, pour un si petit bébé qui n’en a rien à faire des stéréotypes rattachés à sa biologie, on lui adresse des messages totalement différent.

C’est dingue !😱 Et ça c’est uniquement pour les messages d’étrangers dans les rues. Mais c’est beaucoup plus global que ça : la mode et les jouets sont tellement genré que trouver des habits neutres est très difficile ! 🤷‍♀️ Et vous ? Qu’en pensez-vous ? Avez-vous aussi remarqué ces stéréotypes de genre autour de vos bébés et de vos enfants ? Comment y réagissez-vous ?

1264,1264,"""Not My Type""⁣
⁣
Those three words don't mean, ""I didnt rape her"". Those three words aren't a denial of the abhorrent act you've been accused of. ⁣
⁣
Rape is rape. Rape isn't determined by the attractiveness of the victim. To me, that's like saying you did her a favour by forcing yourself onto her because she wasn't attractive in the first place. ⁣
⁣
Does this mean that there is a type you would rape Mr. Trump? Does this mean you usually rape women that look/act a certain way? Do you have a checklist that you mark off before you rape a woman? Does this mean that you have and plan on raping any woman who meets your standard? ⁣
⁣
When someone is accused of rape and they use this ""defense"", you know for a fact that they have or would definitely rape a woman who meets their standard but more importantly; they are capable of raping any woman without fear of consequence. ⁣

1267,1267,"Something weird happened yesterday- we had a supermarket delivery, and had ordered some peonies as they were locally grown. As the delivery guy helped unpack the shopping he said ""I see you've had to buy your own flowers again""

I thought it was a bit odd but was too thrown (and too British) to do anything but laugh awkwardly. But since then I've been thinking about it, and the embedded sexism in that comment. 
1) How did he know I'd bought them? My husband might have done the order and included them as a surprise.

2) Maybe I bought them for my husband! Men can like flowers too.

3) So what if I did? There is nothing weird or sad about a woman buying herself flowers! 
We are so used to sexism that we often don't notice little comments like this that slide into conversation, but I wish I had called him out on it. I do try- one of the times we faced this the most was when planning our wedding. 
We had people assuming I was making all the decisions and Jamie wasn't bothered (he really was), or not understanding why we had a joint hen & stag party (this is pretty much the only non-blurry photo I have from it, which I think tells you what a good night it was!). And it was so tiring to keep explaining that it was his wedding too. And that just because I was a bride, that didn't mean I was irrational or over-emotional.
But we have to fight back. The more we call people out on these assumptions, the more things will start to change- I might have missed my opportunity this time, but next time I'll be ready.

I turned to see that it was a 40 year well-dressed and decent man. I continued walking and he continued to follow me. He would slow down every time I slowed down and would walk fast every time I walked fast. I got a call so I stopped at the end of the bridge and he also stopped. He kept staring at me and as soon as I finished my call, he came up to me and tried to touch me. He asked what was my rate and I screamed at him and caught his shirt. Hearing me, one of the idli-sellers came and helped me take the guy to the police. It was later found that he was a pimp and would traffic girls.” #BeYourOwnSuperhero #DontKeepCalm #RiseTogether

#SkimTalks is just 5 days away... the positive response shows me that this space is much needed. ⁣
⁣
Those who have experienced a sexual violation need much more than #metoo.⁣

We need change in the legal system, change in societal attitudes, most importantly we need sexual violations to stop and the culture of no impunity given to offenders to end.⁣

This week’s Scarlet Letter touches on an often unseen type of workplace harassment and discrimination - invisible illness. •
•
Invisible Illness is typically defined as “a cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, or sensory condition that limits a person’s behaviors, senses, or activities and is not apparent to others.” •
•
Often times, those living with an invisible illness face stigma and judgement from those around them who believe they are simply “making up” or “faking” their suffering.

1291,1291,"How important do you think it is to support women while you travel?

More important than you think. 
Did you know that: 💥An estimated 15 million girls under 18 are married worldwide, with little or no say in the matter. 💥4 out of 5 victims of human trafficking are girls. 💥30 percent of women who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence by their partner. 
THIS IS IN 2019! 💫When money is in the hands of women it give them independence, freedom, and agency. ✅It gives them the ability to call their own shots. ✅It gives them the ability to pursue their passions. ✅It gives them purpose. ✅They can then become what they want to be and give back more to society. The untapped potential out there is astounding. ✅Think of the artists, scientists, and leaders that are unable to achieve their true potential. ✅When money is in the hands of women, it helps all of us.

How do you support female economies? 💸

As the article points out, more than 50% of marine recruits sustain an injury during training but they don’t seem to make the news like a woman perceived as failing does. This article follows the PlymouthLive publishing a patronising article which comes off incredulous that a female trainee marine could possibly impress people during training. Neither of these articles mentions Philippa by name until around half way through and definitely not in the headline. This incredible woman is not being celebrated as a front-runner for the future of female marines but is having every flaw pointed out and only the bad news is being printed.

1299,1299,"Are you ready for a vaguely #feminist rant? .
Yesterday, walking to my car to head back to dinner and night out at the MNU Body Composition Residential (dressed exactly like this... not bad for a 15 minute turnaround time 💁🏼‍♀️) I encountered a group of lads.... maybe about 10 of them, probably a little older than me.
.
“Where are you going in that short skirt you little s**t”
.
Word for word.
.
In what situation is that behaviour acceptable?
.
But I’m really glad that it was me 🤷🏼‍♀️. I can handle it.
.
I can walk up to the main perpetrators and loudly embarrass them.
.
I can talk down to them and belittle them like they’re disgraced children.
.
I can leave the entire group somewhat lost for words.
.
It’s a shame that they’re shocked when somebody stands up to their actions.
.
But at the same time I fully understand why women don’t stand up to this kind of behaviour. 10 athletic looking lads vs me... I don’t fancy my chances. .
Did you know that around 35% of women have experienced some kind of violence or assault at the hands of a male?
.
(I should probably include here... #notallmen)
.
Statistics like that don’t really inspire women to stand up for themselves.
.
We’re (generally) physically smaller and weaker, we probably won’t come off better in a fight.
.
Rape culture should not be this normalised.
.
A skirt is not an invitation.

1304,1304,"Relax it's just a joke.
On women? On black people? On a lower community or someone who has been oppressed from ages.
Relax it's just a song. You don't have to concentrate on lyrics everytime. Enjoy the music.
Relax it's just Movie. People will watch and go.
This is what we need to understand. Everything that highlights oppression.  Is not a thing that should be ignored.
And What I have listened on social media the views of pseudo intellectuals men who believe in their fake equality. That feminists  and leftists highlight  every negative thing they are saddist . So my question is there for you readers.  A Man loves her girl but beats her. We can ignore that because he loves her. A Man abuses her. But we can ignore he loves her. Concentrate on positive right. 100 children died from illness but 200 are healthy. We can ignore 100 right ? Lives don't count much . We are in profit. Negativity and positivity is just in Books and stories. You have to face the reality. Its not immaturity to get offended from such things. We should speak against it. Because the artists of today's generation are creating what people want to see. Not what they want to show.
So please People change. It's not too late.

1309,1309,"Things I learnt in my super progressive school this week :
1) 'boys will be boys'
2) so if I get raped tommorow, it's because I stepped out in a skirt that wasn't 1 inch below my knee :)
3) i have to speak softy because i'm a /lady/
4) i have to follow a list to do's and don't because I'm a /lady/ and this is still the 18th century 
5) i have to behave myself because i'm a guest in an all boy's institution  and  it's not important to teach them anything at all 
6) i have to keep my mouth shut about this because none of my  teachers want to ""go against the authority"" 
7) in conclusion, sexism prevails, jc is totally the progressive educational institute it pretends to be, and the buttoned state of my blazer holds more importance than my grades. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

Motherhood is mentally, emotionally, and physically feasible for most women! How dare you tell women that they are too weak to be mothers. Women are WONDERFUL parents! Pro-life people are in no way forcing women to have abortions. It’s their choice, remember? No one want’s to kill the mother. The whole point of being pro-life is to prevent death. Pro-life people are not responsible for a woman getting hurt from an unsafe abortion when ALL we do is beg her not to get an abortion at all. If she chooses to get an abortion KNOWING it is unsafe, that is HER choice. If it was up to us, no one would get an abortion unless it was medically necessary and would be done in a safe environment.",210

1324,1324,"My new logo is finally finished.

I chose to draw the Lotus for two reasons. First I can identify with its life cycle. It too comes from the dirtiest, murkiest places, Yet still, it blooms, just like me. Second, my sitting in the lotus is also a nod to my Buddhist husband who grounds and centers me in my faith and always has my back.

The pose is for my perpetual prayer for the sexually exploited people who are still lost and being harmed.

The cross is held close to my heart where Jesus and my Father always reside.

I chose to use a hand-drawn image that I could create. As you remember a few years ago I was struggling to learn to even write the simplest things. Due to a TBI it has taken me four long years to be able to accomplish this. Proof that God can heal you, but it doesn't mean you don't have to put in the work as well.

1354,1354,"Eating disorders appear and manifest differently in every individual that struggles, but there is one common denominator presented in everyone: misery.
⠀⠀
The saddest part is that our society encourages behaviors that are present in people who are either 1. on a diet or 2. have an eating disorder.
⠀⠀
Dieting is simply disordered eating in disguise. One is socially acceptable and widely encouraged. The other is taboo and stigmatized.
⠀⠀
Does it sound ‘healthy’ to eliminate entire food groups from your diet? To compensate for the consumption of ‘unhealthy’ foods through exercise? To consciously restrict your intake in an effort to lose weight. To constantly be preoccupied by food, calories, and numbers?
⠀⠀
These disordered behaviors will inevitably make you miserable. Since the vast majority of our population is bombarded with messages that encourage these behaviors, and many actively engage in them, I would speculate that lots of people could be living much happier lives...
⠀⠀
Dieting is just as damaging as having an eating disorder. Will this fact ever be acknowledged and accepted? I don’t know. As of right now, I recognize the harm diets/disordered eating has had on my health, body, and mind. I challenge and question the companies and businesses that are selling recipes for disordered eating, misery, and long term damage to your body in the name of “health and wellness”. I’m just trying to life my happiest life, drinking Nutella hot chocolate whenever I feel like it. ✌🏼🍫",everydaysexism,"|.

This one goes out to all the women out there! How many of us have been at the receiving end of a comment about our appearance that has gotten us down? “She looks quite old now. She used to be so pretty.” “She’s too skinny.” “She’s fat.” “She has a big nose.” “She needs to do something about that hair. A slight nip, a slight tuck, she would look gorgeous.” These words sound familiar?

Girls who turn 40 are meant to fade away or justify their remaining visibility in society through unhelpful hashtags like #fortynotfrumpy.
I Love that my first SM video of myself is as a 40yo not a 20yo and I'm going to keep showing up, speaking about @ferproduction And so, under my coat, I wore a white dress, in order to co-opt and redefine the traditional white-dressed debutante. This is not ritualising teenage virgins entering into the arena of the male gaze for the first time but ritualising women of all ages being visible and heard in their own right.

This is @phyllidaswift I met Phyllida at a  @hubdot and @anthropologieeu event and Alchemy was created when Phyllida, then campaign manager of @changingfacesuk spoke of how her life changed after a car accident left her with a facial scar. I felt instant connectedness to what Phyllida said because her human story resonated about the need to be included and I learned that gender bias exists particularly for women with scars. We interviewed Phyllida to learn more from her perspective for @estilamag Future Fe+Male supplement, out soon. Phyllida is wearing one of my favourite Future Female tee-shirts, available exclusively in store and online @anthropologieeu part of our 5 piece collaboration collection.

Nonfiction books - I don't read them very often, but when I do it's usually something historical, or something political, like Everyday Sexism.

This book, of what I've read so far, is very important. But also very difficult to read - realizing the full extent of, well, everyday sexism, is pretty infuriating. But I think it's also important to be aware.

On a side note, I've started keeping a journal to plan out blog posts and reviews. I also have tried mind-mapping to plan reviews, and I feel it's a great way to dump out all my thoughts on a book!

1370,1370,"#Metoo is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault. The movement began to spread virally in October 2017 as a hashtag on social media in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. It followed sexual-abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

Tarana Burke, an American social activist and community organizer, began using the phrase “Me Too” as early as 2006, and the phrase was later popularized by American actress Alyssa Milano on Twitter in 2017. Milano encouraged victims of sexual harassment to tweet about it and “give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem”. Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the World Health Organization to affect one-third of all women worldwide.

If you live in Tyumen and you are being harassed, abused or if you ever fall victim to rape, don’t be afraid to go to the police, never be ashamed of yourself, speak up and protect yourself. In case you need professional support and advise here’s the Tyumen emergency center “A branch of willow” (Ветка ивы) phone (3452) 32-22-94 , (3452) 32-23-87 , (3452) 22-74-63.

1373,1373,"How do you feel? A rare question to be asked perhaps? Connection has been my theme this year. To feel connected to others, whether likeminded or not? To feel and understand other points view is essential in that journey. Have I felt uncomfortable? Yes. But in that uncomfortable I’ve felt the magic. This month we launch our ‘Born Equal’ podcast. We explore everyday habitual sexism and what it means to call it out and be a part of changing the way we feel and act. Episode 1 out at the end of the month. .

We are almost programmed to ask it and expect an automated response 'good thanks, you?' And we are used to giving an automated response and shrugging off how we may truly feel (positive or negative). Being more connected is the way forward! It leads to understanding and empathy - the more open and honest we are the more normal it becomes; the more connected we become; the more valued we feel and isn't that what we all want to feel? 🥰|Truth..#legacy",94

1380,1380,"Sometimes you need a rest because fighting the patriarchy is exhausting... On average, the time women spend performing unpaid labour amounts to SEVEN MORE YEARS than men (Gates foundation). This unpaid work would be the biggest sector of the global economy - if only it was counted. 
Imagine what women could achieve with those extra years and extra energy. How can we find the energy to fight for a more equal system when our time is being undervalued, undercompensated and overburdened?

You can chose what you buy. But somehow it's men's fault you buy a pink razor?|Where is the patriarchy|“Men’s” razors usually cost less than “Women’s” razors. I just buy the least expensive highest quality razors. We don’t have to follow what the marketing teams are trying to sell us - same product with higher cost.|Outlaw the pink tax 🚺|Then just buy that razor if you want it he cant police what you buy|Actually just used one of my sister's razors and it was much better than my electric one with replaceable heads, I dunno. Worse for the environment? Yes. More expensive? Yeah. But you also get a pack of 50 whereas with most normal packs of heads you get far less for your buck. I dunno. Interesting question. Pink tax is kinda infuriating. But people are ~ largely (there is something to be said about corporate influence through media) ~ rational, independent actors capable of making their own decisions. This situation is radical and unrealistic, and as a result, is misleading. Nobody's forcing you to do anything. Companies are ALWAYS trying to make more money through advertising and creating selective products. It wouldn't be happening if you didn't keep buying.|Name one instance where this has happened|Wait but actually tho can I buy scented razors",3392

Future Fe+Male is a volunteer initiative that the women and men we meet give time to passionately because the belief is we have a space and purpose to see action in the evolution of everyday language shifting from being habitually sexist. We can’t wait to share their stories.

How the fuck is someone allowed to sexually assault someone and get a slap on the wrist but someone who had their own personal marijuana plant get more years/punishment than a rapist?? •The biggest case that fires me up is the Brock Turner case. How the hell did he only serve 3 months of time for traumatizing and violating a woman. There were multiple witnesses as well. How is this acceptable??!? Why is someone getting sent to jail for 5-10 years for marijuana use but Brock Turner, the rapist gets sentenced 6 months but only has to serve 3 pf those months. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE & more people need to speak up about this.

1411,1411,"The plan was to find the indie galleries typically drawn to smaller shows but this was not to be missed Dora Maar @centrepompidou so much to love so much that I found as a curator was amiss, the first works are of Dora as a model not an artist, which made for a confusing introduction, the exhibition labels also name checked all the other artists except Dora’s so there was an expectation that you would know what works were by her. Then noticing the way different glass was used for Maar and Picasso’s works tipped me over the edge 😳🤣if you are doing a serious solo exhibition of an artist giving her a platform please make sure you follow that through and don’t use double standards. So the issue was Dora’s photographs were framed with standard glass making them awful to photograph whilst Picasso had the full museum grade non reflect UV protection glass. The cost is always a consideration with any exhibition but with @chanelofficial as the main sponsor you’d hope for more parity. •

1415,1415,"Throwback picture because instead of actually enjoying the Great British Summer (HA ☔️) I’ve obviously been glued to my sofa watching Love Island for the last couple of weeks.
BUT it’s all paid off since the lovely people at @cosmopolitanuk let me rant today about one of my biggest gripes of this season- Lucie saying that she doesn’t have female friends because they’re too much “drama”. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
So I took to my writing desk (JK I write basically everything in bed) to talk about why female friendship is so bloody brilliant and why Lucie spouting reductive stereotypes of what it means to be a woman is a sign of internalised misogyny.

⠀
warning - extremely sensitive content.
⠀
I’ve traveled a lot of countries and I see it happening everywhere - women are being treated bad because of showing their sexuality. I am sick and tired of societies treating women like hoe for simply putting a picture online, showing love for their bodies.⠀
while women working hard like man, at the same time raising children, preparing food and cleaning houses for their beloved loves, women are judged unfair and hard for simple beauty.⠀
while men take their shirts off everywhere : in public places, on covers of journal, on TV, on YouTube videos, in movies, on music clips... in India, Russia, Georgia, Italy, Spain etc I saw man walking without their shirts on the streets. Man can show his body E.V.E.R.Y.W.H.E.R.E. without any prejudices and any consequences after doing it. Nobody asks male actor in the interview how their kids feel seeing their dad in that bed scene, while actresses are called hoe and treated like #escort people as soon as hot-scene with her being movie is released.⠀
⠀
I was told to delete all my showing body pictures when #Kanchana3 was released.⠀
⠀
Why?⠀
Because man wanted me to do it and then anyway man will judge me and talk about me like I am a bad girl?⠀
Okay, I deleted everything even I didn’t agree it was right, so what? Man still wrote all those yellow press articles about me being harassed, doing hot photoshoots. Maybe it’s #men who want women to look like this?⠀
⠀
Like in kindergarten they made themselves look good, calling everyone else around bad. Nice try guys.⠀
⠀
With all due respect, I think it’s time for people to mind their own business and stop prejudice for women. Women can love their body and be proud of it, too!⠀

Something negative.. While when i see u post i just shocked and when i read the captain and its awesome... Fight for justice.. Always love u as a fan|Yoyo❤️ @aga.ny|@aga.ny mam, I totally agree with your point of view. It is absolutely correct about what you have talked about. I just wanted to state one thing is, sexism should not be about showing off the body. It should be about the opportunities women are getting, realisation of their hardwork, acceptance that women can Never, I repeat Never be equal to men because they are greater than men. Me myself being a male, am telling that women were, are and always be greater than men because the hardwork they are doing in life is not completely visible to everyone (not even to another women) but the stress is double the amount of stress a man has from office work. So what I feel is promoting awareness equality of men and women should be stopped and must start appreciating for the work some by women every moment alive. But due to the busy schedule of ours, we properly cannot even thank our mothers for their hardwork. I choose a day when my mom doesn't have lots of work to do, and I sit with her the entire day and just make her happy. The society is now realising that this change is required, and it is changing but it will definitely take time because it is the society. And when coming to indian culture, women do expose their body but not in a manner where everything is visible, but in a way that the man gets excited to talk to her and starts to go crazy. In India, since centuries, this is the trend being followed. So for this to change will take many more centuries because this kind of exposing was, is and will be the trend definitely. Oh yes, ofcourse. This is definitely your account and you can post whatever you want to and no one has the right to tell/ask you to remove the pic and likewise you don't have the obligation to do as they say. So it's totally upto you to post pics u like. But as you fan, I am requesting you to upload more cute pics of yours in a saree because you were looking awesome in saree than in shirt & pant.

I have spent the last six months recovering from an injury that should have never happened. I chose not to dance with a man while I was out celebrating my birthday, and he chose to assault me in protest. I should always have the right to say no without the fear of being hurt. 
Nevertheless, I have continued to smile and move forward. I celebrated the holidays with friends and family. I took pain killers and muscle relaxers to cope with traveling almost every week for two months for vet school interviews, doing my best to hide my pain. I have started new jobs, traveled internationally, and finalized my vet school decision, all while going to physical therapy, acupuncture, and doctors. Last week I officially graduated from physical therapy for my back and shoulder injury. 
This experience has been beyond frustrating, but it has forced me to respect and prioritize my health. I am grateful for it being part of my journey and for making me stronger, body and soul.

Frighteningly it was only my outright insistence that I be investigated for each disease that instigated the diagnoses. Each time I was told by my treating doctor that I did not have the disease. Each time I did. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was shouted at by a gastroenterologist in a major hospital; ""You're a perfectly healthy young woman"", I was asked sarcastically whilst on the gurney about to go under if I needed help with learning how to go to the toilet properly, I was told to wipe front to back by a gastroenterologist when I complained that I felt my reproductive system was implicated, and then she asked if anyone in my family had psychosis and sent me to see a psychologist. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My most recent laparoscopy revealed my uterus, left ovary, pelvic wall, uteral sacrament, and rectum were all thickened with inflammation and scar tissue and were fused together. It turns out your internal organs need to move freely within or guess what - it leads to chronic pain?!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
What I am hoping from taking CBD oil is to ditch the panadol; decrease pelvic pain, improve my sleep and reduce anxiety.

Despite the way I was treated by  doctors there is no shame in having anxiety and it doesn't mean that your physical symptoms are not real. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I have anxiety and yet I was right all along 💪

1437,1437,"The world has made incredible progress in shattering the glass ceiling and empowering women. But there's still a long way to go. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all of the double standards women still face, but here are 10 ways women are unfairly inconvenienced, shamed, and discriminated against just for being female.
⠀
6. Cleavage is prevalent in advertisements and media, but women breastfeeding their children in public are often told to cover up.
⠀
7. Men are disproportionately praised for taking care of their children, whereas women are expected to be caregivers.
⠀
8. Any parenting decision a woman makes is subject to ""mom shaming""&
⠀
9. Dad bods"" are considered attractive, but women are expected to lose baby weight after giving birth instantly.
⠀
10. Women pay more for the same everyday items because of the so-called ""pink tax."" The ""pink tax"" refers to how products for women, like razors in ""feminine"" colors, are often pricier than the men's equivalent.
⠀
Unfortunately, this list can easily be continued. There are so many double standards for women, they won’t fit in an insta post, and that’s really disappointing. That’s why we’ve decided to discuss this topic during our first meeting.
⠀
Ladies, please share other examples of double standards in comments!

1439,1439,"Changing rape culture is something I’m particularly passionate about although I know there is more I can do. I have never been to a rally or protest but this movement means a lot to me. Rape prevention techniques I discovered when I was about 14/15 and even then I was shocked about how the responsibility was put on the potential victims. - Don’t dress that way
- Don’t drink that much
- Have a buddy system
Etc etc
So if you don’t follow the rules it’s somehow your fault? Are you a slut? Did you deserve it?...BULLSHIT!
.
.
Although I think some safety precautions have their place, there was never any onus on the criminal and to this day it isn’t all the way there. We’ve all heard the “it shouldn’t ruin the life of a young mans with so much promise” 🤮
.
.
As I grew up I understood more about the cruel sexually violent history against women (and men), I learned about consent and what that means and how convoluted that can become when there is someone who is so focused on getting what they want they fail to see what’s in front of them. You do not have a right to anyone. If someone is drunk af and they say yes...it doesn’t matter. Their judgement impaired. That is not consent. If they still want to have sex with you when they’re sober and have all their faculties...go for it!
.
.
Education and understanding around consent should be an important part of a child’s life. The same as respect for yourself and for others, no matter how that person identifies. .
.
If you think something has happened to you, talk to someone. There are people out there who can help and understand what you’re going through xxx

Yes it's a harsh and harrowing subject, but we can't always trust the parents to teach children something that can otherwise be so dark. Some parents will avoid telling their children things like this even happen in an attempt to shelter them. I think the topic of consent in relationships definitely needs more publicity. Amazing work and amazing that you're speaking out 💖|Well said, and thank you for speaking truth to power ❤️|Hear hear. I have two boys and have always made the effort to educate them on consent. That includes not forcing them to kiss family members, not touching them without their consent, talking about boundaries etc. I took my 10 year old to a sex and relationships workshop a few weeks ago where the kids talked about consent a lot. All the parents I know take a similar approach so I hope the tide will turn with this generation.|so feminsts telling inocent random men not to rape when they have no intetion of rape. are as bad as racist people who will tell a black guy not to rob when he has no intnetion of robbing",63

1444,1444,"This sign hangs on a coach's door at the campus where I work. There's a big part of me that appreciates the sentiment--everyone within our campus community has a part in the overall feeling of what it means to BE a community. There have been plenty of days I wished for the option of having a sign like this on my office door, and to also ask people so blatently to take responsibility for how they show up at work. 
But I feel that being a woman manager, there are so many strange lines, and if I put a sign up like this, I'm sure it would be interpreted as having a ""bad"" attitude or unprofessional approach. The double bind of having to run an office and walk a line of ""likeability"" is tough. I'm reminded of it every time one of the women presidential candidates speak. (PS not comparing my job to running for president.) I wish that there was a way that I could effectively explain this to cis male colleagues as a real challenge in my career. Not just career, but in everyday life. I'm traveling today and a guy at the airport said I ""looked angry"" and that I should smile. I'm traveling for a conference and remembering the last one I went to where a man in the audience told the woman presenter that she ""looked good"" in front of everyone, not mentioning the quality of her presentation. 
What would it mean for cis men to take responsibility for how they show up in their treatment of women? To take responsibility for noticing that they would never tell a man to smile, or give professional feedback that being direct in meetings meant you are perceived as ""aggressive"" with your opinions, or comment on a male colleague's appearance after a presentation at a national conference? For so many people who work in education, there seems to be an assumption that we are over everyday sexism in the workplace, or that we know better about these things than other industries. I'm not so sure about that. ..... #highered #womenatwork #highereducation #advocacy #gradstudent #womensrights #genderequity #doctoralstudent  #academicaffairs #studentaffairs #doublebind #academia #EdD

My local bike shop (a very well known, highly recommended one) haven’t bothered to service my bike. ..
I get the impression that they think that because I’m a woman I can’t be a serious cyclist and just need my brakes checked and my gears indexed.

I’m about to do a 1000+ mile self supported race and I’ve just sacrificed 3 days of training because they’ve had my bike sitting in their workshop. I specifically asked them to check hubs, headset, bottom bracket and wheel truing and they didn’t do any of it. They told me that it was “more than I needed”. ..
They even said “you must have had some work done on it recently”. Yes, I changed the gear cables, brake cables, chain and upgraded the cassette and rear mech. ALL BY MYSELF. ..

1452,1452,"So I got annoyed yesterday and had a rant for the way paditv portrayed women in diving. -
Not because I don’t appreciate a good looking woman but because of the image they used to represent PADI Women’s Dive Day.
-
Use it any other time but why use this image beautiful as these women are to promote PADI Women’s Dive Day which exists because in paditv’s own words “our statistics show that on average there are more male PADI certified recreational divers than female. To help address this we started PADI Women’s Dive Day and other women’s initiatives to encourage women to enter and continue to enjoy diving.”
-
Reasons I got annoyed:
They’re snorkelling or possibly free diving not scuba diving. Their wetsuits are up their arses and it promotes none of the values PADI Women’s Dive Day should.
- 
Yes they look amazing but as a PADI IDC Staff Instructor I am disappointed there are no images of women training students, continuing education, female research divers, female diving eco warriors, female safety divers and even female divers in dry suits. Yes not all diving is in the tropics.
-
I know tits and arse sells but don’t sell women short especially on PADI Women’s Dive Day maybe instead celebrate what we bring to the industry as well as our awesome tits and arses.
-
If you really are interested in encouraging women into diving and into the industry please use positive images of female divers, eco warriors, scientists, safety divers and have some female divers on your marketing team.
-
Most women aren’t going to be encouraged to go diving from seeing tits and arse shots, especially when there is no diving equipment and one of the snorkels is on the wrong side. - pic one quote from paditv

This sinew
Just a vessel to be used
My end predetermind
I’m a full gone conclusion
To you
You tie my ending with a noose of my femininity 
Ready to hang my
Hopes and dreams with your steadfast impenetrable opinions
Inflexible in your stance
As hard as steel
Ready to break me

You domesticate me with your opinions
Inequality is nature you say
Common disparities you say
Tick tock
Your watching my clock
Your sight cannot see past the mist 
That clouds you
Your glass ceiling
With your reinforced views
Pigeon hole me
This womb it seems
Will trap me
I think
How unfair
Your lack of responsibility
Unburden me
Unshackle my femininity

You speak without shame
Using our differences to
Suffocate me
You tell me
This is the way
Fall inline
Line me with the grit 
To break your common sense
Make me turn your stark views
That cut the form of me
To see me more than a woman born to breed 
Tick tock

You cut me to the core
You will always see my footsteps fading in the sand
Cut your views from a different cloth
Unshackle me
I beg for unshackled femininity #feminism #woman #metoo #yestoallwomen # #womensreality  #fourthwavefeminism #mysogynism #classceilings #feministpower #iamanastywoman #iamanastywomen #imwithher #everydaysexism #tothegirls #breakglassceilings #glassceiling #glassceilingbreakers #poem #poetry #spokenword #words #wordsmith #london #uk #uae #instapoetrycommunity #instpoet #masculinity #womenempowerment #spokenword #londonpoet @jameelajamilofficial @chessiekingg",everydaysexism,|❤️ love this|🔥|THISSS!

1457,1457,"It’s a shame that in this day and age, a woman still has to be modest to be respected. What makes you think you’re entitled to someone else’s choice of dressing? Bikini or burka, NOBODY is asking for it. Instead of focusing on how daughters should cover up, we as a society should also teach our sons to lower their gaze.

1461,1461,"Hey everyone!!! The Facebook community for the podcast is LIVE! The purpose of the community is to continue the discussions from the podcast and build a community of women to support and inform each other. The group is called Shouting About The Silence Community. It is a safe space to ask and answer questions, find and share inspiration, and build a supportive community. .

The podcast will have the same name. It was initially going to be called Unspoken because we’ll dive into the women’s issues that get so often overlooked, but I ultimately decided on the name Shouting About The Silence because that’s exactly what this podcast will do. .

We share so many of the same experiences, and through opening up about them we’ll find so much that brings us together. We’ll find solutions to problems we’re facing, we’ll stay informed on issues that do and don’t affect us, and we’ll build empathy and awareness of women’s issues. .

Since school has been out I’ve been able to put in the time necessary to make this podcast what I want it to be, and I CANNOT wait to share it with everyone!! A few things to look forward to when it airs:

1- a monthly book club where we read and discuss books that focus on women’s issues 
2- a blog on the Shouting About The Silence website that dives into feminism and furthers the conversations in the podcast
3- feminist/women’s art to spice up your space
4- a diverse community of ladies to inspire and support you
5- and, of course, an awesome podcast

So head over to the Facebook page and join the community of women who are Shouting About The Silence 🗣 .

They are afraid of anything that challenges their hold, their need for subjugation and oppression. The anti abortion laws are just a last ditch effort to control womens’ bodies.

- ⠀
My colleague asked me the correct word to use when referring to an LGBT team member’s significant other, whether they should use “partner” or “husband”. ⠀
-⠀
When I told her they had just gotten married, so “husband” is accurate, my male manager snorted in disgust and blurted out, “please, I just had breakfast.”⠀
- ⠀
As the manager of the LGBT individual, I went to HR, who decided to go to the harasser’s manager (an equally “good-old-boys-club” individual), who defended the harasser and said “that doesn’t sound like something he would say.” ⠀

I apologize for being so inactive on this account lately. I'm gonna be honest, I go through cycles where this account brings me more frustration than excitement. I love being able to have a platform and a voice, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by bad news, horrible tragedies in the media, and people who reach out to me with heartbreaking stories. (Btw: this is not to say don't reach out to me; I'm always here to offer support and advice when needed). Having this account does take a slight toll on my mental health, and that fact coupled with the fact that summer vacation just started for me means that I'm not as active as I wish I could be. I'll post more often pretty soon but for now, it'll be maybe a post every other day. Thank you guys for understanding.

1485,1485,"Repost and ty @wearefuturefemale (and @thesweetfeminist!) Ever get the ‘stop over reacting’ response during a discussion you are having that you are either :
.
A) Passionate about or
B) annoyed or angry about.?
.
If humans are encouraged to  repress anger, particularly girls and women, according to clinicians it can manifest into anxiety, depression, and illness because it’s not given free expression. This comes from ‘Rage Becomes Her’ by Soraya Chemaly, @sorayachemaly scroll across to see the brilliant book I’m reading. Chemaly reveals how suppressing anger is a trait girls and women are taught to do from an early age. Seemingly passive phrases like stop overacting is a phrase I’ve heard from men and women and it really annoys me! 🤯In fact it makes me so angry I want to punch the person saying it.

De recevoir ce type de SMS avec en plus une relance.
Les femmes sont autant capable que les hommes... Faites des ateliers pr les novices, mais pas en montrant du doigt les femmes.

Et quand je bois chacune des réactions de mon entourage je vois qu'il y a encore de nombreuses manières de penser à changer !

Mais alors ça Et d'une grande enseigne...
Réveillez vous en 2019 !! Faite tourner

1490,1490,"Apparently on a TV show which involves men literally picking women out of a line up and in which the misogyny, sexism and downright disrespect of women is seen as ‘cheeky’ and entertaining (a few years ago, a contestant repeatedly referred to a female contestant as ‘it’), a woman has come in who owns her sexuality and expresses a sexual interest in a man, she’s crass and it is front-page news.

I have never understood why Tim Atkin gives Washam even the time of day and it long ago made me lose respect for him and stop reading his site. This is totally next level though and I am sorry to hear about it. If I could apologise on behalf of all British men, I would.

I can't believe he gets away with it, and seems to be touted as some kind of expert. His pieces in the voice of 'lo hi qu' are disgusting.

We need to call this b.s. when it oozes out and bring attention to how inappropriate it is.
